The Indian economy is “remarkably resilient” amid a global slowdown because of “solid” domestic demand, moderate inflation, sustained capital expenditure and continued buoyancy in revenue collections, the finance ministry said in its monthly review on Tuesday.

An upbeat farm output has sustained rural demand, which will get a further boost from the winter crop output, said the Monthly Economic Review for October. “Several indicators, such as sales of fast-moving consumer goods and two and three-wheelers, point towards improvement in rural demand,” it said.

Rising rural wages, increasing minimum support prices and prospects of healthy sowing for the winter cropping will add further strength to the rural demand, it added. Rapid progress in the procurement of wheat and rice has ensured a continuous increase in food buffers, which will aid in curbing inflationary pressures caused by uneven rainfall distribution in the country, besides strengthening food security, it said.
Industrial activity will expand as the trajectory of manufacturing activity is firm enough to withstand temporary headwinds of rising input costs and realignment of production lines with fast-paced changes in consumer preferences, the ministry said. The fall in the manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) from 57.5 in September to 55.5 in October is “temporary” due to rising raw material costs. A value greater than 50 signifies expansion.
Although competitive conditions and rising cost pressures led to a moderation in services PMI services to 58.4 in October from 61 in September, it is still in an expansionary zone, it said. “Despite rising input costs, overall sentiment in the services sector remains upbeat, driven, among others, by an upswing in the tourism cum hotel industry induced by leisure travel, business travel, and social events.” The country’s “booming e-commerce industry” is “another strong pillar” of the country’s services sector, the review said.
Notwithstanding geopolitical upheavals and global headwinds due to major central banks keeping interest rates high, India will maintain its growth momentum due to the government’s sustained investment push, healthy corporate profits and a reduction in bad loans, it said. Inflation will ease moderate further as crude oil prices soften, it projected. “Recognising this, RBI (Reserve Bank of India) has also indicated that any further tightening of monetary policy will likely occur when transmission is closer to completion and if the situation warrants,” the review said.
The report, however, cautioned about inflationary pressures, particularly due to external factors. “With more than half of the current financial year witnessing positive developments in the economy, the full financial year should conclude as projected with a strong growth performance and macroeconomic stability,” it said. “Yet, risks on the downside persist. Inflation is one of them that has kept both the government and the RBI on high alert.”
Financial flows in the external sector also need monitoring as they impact the value of the rupee and the balance of payments, it said. “A fuller transmission of the monetary policy may also temper domestic demand,” it added.
India’s growth in the year to March should continue to be a “positive outlier” compared with other major economies, the review said. In the medium-term, a sustained focus on public investment in infrastructure and advances in digital public infrastructure would enable India to look forward to a longer economic and financial cycle than in the past, it said.
“A normalising base and an erratic monsoon are expected to result in a sequential moderation in the GDP [gross domestic product] growth to 7.0% in Q2 FY2024 from 7.8% in Q1 FY2024. Regardless, we anticipate that the GDP expansion in this quarter will exceed the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC’s) October 2023 projection of 6.5%,” Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head-Research & Outreach, ICRA Ltd, said.
“Looking ahead, uneven rainfall, narrowing differentials with year-ago commodity prices, the possible slowdown in momentum of Government capex as we approach the Parliamentary Elections, weak external demand and the cumulative impact of monetary tightening are likely to translate into lower GDP growth in H2 FY2024. As a result, we maintain our FY2024 GDP growth estimate at 6.0%, lower than the MPC’s projection of 6.5% for the fiscal,” she added.

India's economic growth is projected to be just under 7% this year, the highest among major economies, despite global headwinds, said Nirmala Sitharaman.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said India is expected to overtake Japan and Germany to emerge as the third largest economy in the world by 2027.

Addressing the Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue here, Sitharaman said India's economic growth is estimated to be just under 7 per cent during the year, the highest among major economies, despite global headwinds.
We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
The Indian economy is therefore on the right track and is heading towards a bright future, she said.
Amidst supply-chain disruptions and economic turbulence due to contemporary conflicts that impact the Indo-Pacific, irrespective of whether they are occurring in relatively distant Ukraine or in relatively-proximate Israel or Yemen, and despite the palpable tensions prevalent in the South- and East China Sea, the Indian economy stands out as a bright spot, she said.
""Even according to the usually conservative estimates of the IMF, the Indian economy is set to emerge as the world's third largest economy by 2027, hopping over Japan and Germany, as its GDP crosses the USD 5 trillion level. By 2047, India aspires to be a developed economy,"" she said.
Talking about India's 'Blue economy', she said, it accounts for roughly 4 per cent of the GDP and represents a sea of opportunities.
India has 9 states and 4 Union Territories situated on the coast, 12 major and 200 non-major ports situated along its coastline, and a vast network of navigable waterways for international and domestic trade, she said.
According to the UNCTAD, India was the 2nd largest exporter of ocean-based goods and services among developing countries in 2020.
Observing that Indo-Pacific is undoubtedly the world's most economically dynamic region, Sitharaman said it encompasses 60 per cent of global GDP, and almost 50 per cent of global merchandise trade.
On the other hand, the Indo-Pacific is also a geopolitically contested space that is being roiled by great power competition, she said.
""One draws its legitimacy from an internationally accepted and consensually derived rules-based order. India stands firmly and proudly in the vanguard of this system,"" she said.
While the other seeks to discredit and disrupt this consensually derived rules-based order and supplant it with an international order whose rules are generated in an exclusive State, she said.
As India accelerates its economic growth and uplifts its teeming masses, moving them from poverty to prosperity, she said it is registering impressive gains in its comprehensive national power as well as in terms of its international stature.
""Today, Indians 'whether at home or abroad' stand, walk, talk, and act with their heads held high... even as the world appreciates India's achievements and successes and lauds it for its demonstrated resilience amidst multiple crises, we are very clear that we cannot afford to be an inward-leaning power,"" she said.
""Our focus on transitioning from a 'brown' economic model to a 'blue' one and thereafter extrapolating this blue transition across the length and breadth of the Indo-Pacific demands that we shoulder greater and heavier regional responsibilities, and this is precisely what we are doing,"" she said.
India has significantly improved its position as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive environment for business, as reflected in several global indices.
Noting that the country's comprehensive national power is going to remain inextricably linked to the ocean, she said India is seized of the pressing need to grow the maritime sector as a whole and the government is determined to provide the requisite support by way of fiscal policy and financial outlay.
""We seek to position India as a hub in new and diversified supply chains and value chains across the Indo-Pacific and, indeed, across the world.
""Towards this end, I am happy to inform you that all sectors of the government are responding exceedingly positively to our new financial policies,"" she said.
In terms of international shipments, she said India's global ranking has risen from 44th place in 2014, to the 22nd rank in 2023.
Similarly, as per the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index report 2023, she said, the 'turn-around time' of Indian ports is now just 0.9 days, which is lower than ports in established maritime centres such Singapore, the UAE, Germany, the USA, Australia, Russia, and South Africa.
""Our experience of the maritime manifestations of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shipping insurance, too, becoming a particular area of policy focus,"" she said.
On the one hand, a 'Marine Cargo Pool' has now been created with the full support of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India and domestic insurance companies, to support maritime trade on the other hand the country is improving its strength in shipping arbitration, and in order to reduce India's vulnerability to international sanctions.
To provide greater strategic flexibility in shipping operations, she said ""we are setting up a full-fledged Indian-owned and India-based Protection and Indemnity (P&I) entity that will additionally provide protection to coastal and inland shipping.""
On the capacity building front, she said, as many as 31 projects have been identified in 9 major ports for monetisation under the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) launched in 2022, with a total estimated CAPEX of 14,483 crore rupees (1.74 billion US dollars) for FY 2022-25.
Terming India-Middle East-Europe Connectivity Corridor (IMEC) as one of the most promising connectivity projects, Sitharaman said it will be a win-win situation for all states involved, as it enhances transportation efficiency, reduces logistic costs, increases economic unity, generates employment, and lowers Greenhouse Gas emissions, contributing to a cleaner, safer, better world.
""However, it is not without its geopolitical challenges and the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza is a worrying manifestation of these,"" she said.
The IMEC was signed at the 18th G-20 Summit held in New Delhi in September.
It is a multimodal economic corridor that incorporates multiple networks of shipping, railways, and roadways and will also include electricity cables, high-speed data cables, and a hydrogen pipeline.
The corridor is expected to create a reliable and cost-effective cross-border, ship-to-rail transit network to supplement existing maritime and road transport, and facilitate trade and connectivity, leading to the economic integration of South Asia, West Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

IIP numbers reveal consumption demand at the bottom of the pyramid needs to pick up for economic growth to regain momentum
The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew at 5.8% in September, a sharp fall from the 10.3% print in August. The latest IIP numbers are in keeping with the trend in the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which continues to be in an expansion zone, but has been losing momentum. What is the larger message behind these numbers? Should the loss of economic momentum be a cause for concern? Three points need to be made here.
PREMIUM
The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew at 5.8% in September(Bloomberg File Photo)
One of the factors driving relatively muted growth in the past few months is the waning of a favourable base effect. This may hold not just for high-frequency numbers such as IIP and PMI but also GDP figures. To be sure, the RBI governor has gone on record to say that the September quarter GDP numbers could end up higher than the 6.5% projection by the Monetary Policy Committee of RBI. This is in line with analysts saying the Indian economy continues to be resilient despite some loss in momentum.
The second factor is the question of what is driving growth. A use-based classification of the IIP numbers shows that capital goods and infrastructure are leading a growth charge while consumer goods are yet to gain momentum. This, once again, is not a new phenomenon and has been a hallmark of the Indian economy in the post-pandemic phase, which has also seen a sharp increase in central government capital spending. Apart from being a short-term growth driver, government capex is also creating valuable infrastructure for future growth.
Without any prejudice to these first two factors, there is a third point that merits flagging. As long as consumption demand does not gather a sustained momentum, private investment will continue to remain weak. It is the virtuous cycle of precisely these two variables that can put the Indian economy on a sustained growth path that is more than the current 6%-6.5%.
Given that a lot of anecdotal evidence and sales numbers point towards strong demand by the rich, the problem and its solution have to be located at the bottom of the pyramid. The world’s fastest-growing economy must not lose sight of its K-shaped recovery problem.

Countries like India need policies based on reliable data for sustainable growth: World Bank chief economist Indermit Gilll
Middle-income countries like India need to make policies based on reliable data to get into the league of high-income nations in next 3-4 decades as achieving sustainable growth will become harder, World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill said on Thursday.
Chief Economist of the World Bank Group Indermit Gill (C)(AFP)
Addressing an event here, Gill said, to grow into higher-income countries, MCIs (Middle Income Countries) will have to reduce deficits in their mid-sized firms.

""(Going forward) economic growth will get harder for middle-income countries like India, not easier... If you (middle-income countries like India) want to get into high-income country in the next 3-4 decades then you will have to make policies based on reliable information,"" he said.
Gill pointed out that relatively few countries (31) have grown into high-income countries between 1990 and 2021.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set an ambitious target of making India a developed nation by 2047.
According to the World Bank, the world's middle-income countries (MICs) are a diverse group by size, population, and income level.
They are defined as lower middle-income economies -- those with a GNI (Gross National Income) per capita between USD 1,036 and USD 4,045; and upper middle-income economies -- those with a GNI per capita between USD 4,046 and USD 12,535.
Middle-income countries are home to 75 per cent of the world's population and 62 per cent of the world's poor.
At the same time, MICs represent about one-third of global GDP and are major engines of global growth.
Countries with annual per capita income of over USD 12,000 are defined as high-income economies.

Claudia Goldin's research on women's labor force participation challenges traditional economic assumptions
I can think of three reasons to celebrate Claudia Goldin’s win of the Economics Nobel Prize—or the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel to use its proper name. She’s only the third woman to be awarded an economics Nobel and, unlike Esther Duflo and Elinor Ostrom, the first to get it on her own without a male colleague.
Economic historian Claudia Goldin, a Harvard professor who won the 2023 Nobel economics prize for her work examining wage inequality between men and women, speaks at a news conference at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., October 9, 2023. REUTERS/Reba Saldanha (REUTERS)
Moreover, Nobel 2023 has seen four women honoured this year; for peace (Narges Mohammadi), medicine (Katalin Kariko jointly with Drew Weissman), physics (Anne L’Huillier with Pierre Agostini and Ferenc Krausz) and economics. Given that in 121 years, from 1901 to 2022, only 60 women had won the prize, this is quite a haul.
We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
It’s the third reason that I’m cheering the loudest. An economic historian at Harvard University, Goldin, now 77, has since the 1970s been looking at a topic that has gained currency in recent times: Women’s labour force participation. Until the Second Wave Feminism’s raised consciousness of the 1970s, the history of economics had been written by men. The assumption, notes the Economist, was that economic growth led to a more level playing field.
Goldin’s work put that assumption on its head. “She had to be a detective,” Randi Hjalmarsson, a member of the prize committee said. What she unearthed was a narrative arc of women’s lives and employment that was quite different from that of men’s. The shift from agrarian to factory economics, she found, resulted in women dropping off paid employment as they found it difficult to balance home responsibilities with long factory shifts. It was only with the rise of the services sector in the 20th century that women bounced back to paid work, in what Goldin and other economists call the U-curve.
As a woman, Goldin asked questions rarely, if ever, asked before. Did the contraceptive pill impact labour force participation? Yes, obviously.
When it came to the gender wage gap that persists well into the 21st century, she looked at the possible reasons. Perhaps the fault lay with ‘greedy’ professions like law and consulting that demand long hours. When women become mothers, they either drop out of work, or take a salary hit because they simply don’t have enough hours to put in the time.
Her findings told the world the story of the other half. It’s a story that needs to be told; a story that visibilises the invisible and valuable work of women.
“Feminist economists have long argued for the need to recognize the paramount value of ‘reproductive labour’ that most often is performed by women, that allows the ‘productive economy’ to function smoothly,” said Prof Ashwini Deshpande, head of the economics department at Ashoka University.
All women work, but not all women are paid for their work. And yet it is women’s unpaid work in cooking, cleaning and taking care of the kids, elderly and sick that enable men to pursue paid work. Or, to put it another way, the more time women spend on unpaid care work, the less time they have for paid work.
Goldin’s research is limited to the US market. There are differences with India where women bear one of the world’s largest burdens of unpaid care work. This explains to a certain degree the mystery of the missing women from our workforce. In the post-liberalisation years when the economy was opening up and new opportunities were presenting themselves, at a time when 24.3 million men went to work, women were quitting paid work in droves. A 2017 World Bank report noted that partly this was due to the fact that girls were opting to stay on in school. But partly it had to do with how we saw women’s place in society.
Over a year in 2017, I wrote a series of articles trying to understand the roadblocks to women’s employment. The first dip came not from motherhood but from marriage. There were other issues, the lack of safe and affordable public transport, a not-unjustified perception of public safety, and the distrust of women’s agency.
These were stories that could never be understood or told, unless you were actively looking at gender implications. Alongside there was a growing body of work that studied the likely impact on economies and GDP if women worked at par with men. All of this led to a new and growing conversation on the need to look at policy changes that would enable women to stay the course.
For far too long we had viewed economics as if gender didn’t matter. Now, we know and acknowledge that it does. Goldin’s work has not just shown the need for this conversation but opened the path for scores of younger feminist economists to examine, question and rewrite received wisdom about women and work.

Two questions require rigorous examination: Is India the new global growth driver? Where will India’s own big driver for future growth come from?
If the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecasts of the IMF are to be believed, India’s GDP will grow at 6.3% between 2023-24 and 2028-29, the latest period for which these numbers are available. China’s growth will be lower than India’s throughout this period, making India the fastest growing major economy in the world.

Is India now the most important driver of global growth in the world now, as many people claim?(AFP File Photo)
This is not all. India’s GDP growth was higher than China’s in the three years beginning 2014-15. India’s lead was interrupted by the slowdown which began with the economic disruption of demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST) and ended in the pandemic-induced contraction in 2020-21. Latest numbers show that India has reclaimed its lead vis-à-vis China. If the IMF's forecasts till 2028 hold, India would be the fastest growing major economy in 11 out of 15 years beginning 2014. This is not an insignificant achievement.
But is India now the most important driver of global growth in the world now, as many people claim?
China versus India’s contribution to global GDP
Using IMF data once again can help us answer this question. India’s contribution to global GDP (in current dollar terms) will be at least 7% in every year between 2023 and 2028. While this number has been higher intermittently, it being consistently higher than 7% is clearly a break as far as India’s long-term contribution to global GDP growth is concerned. However, this does not make India the leading driver of economic growth in the world.
Even with a sub-5% GDP growth rate between 2024 and 2028, China’s contribution to global GDP growth will be at least two to three times higher than India’s.
To be sure, data clearly shows that China’s importance as the global growth driver is coming down. Between 2010 and 2019, China accounted for 40% of overall global GDP growth. This number is projected to fall to just 20% in the period between 2019 and 2028. This number was 0.8%, 7.1% and 14.9% respectively in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s for China.
For India, these numbers are 1.2%, 1.3%, 3.8%, 5.8% and (projected to be) 6.7% for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010-2019 and 2019-2028 respectively.
What is really interesting is the fact that the US is set to reclaim its position as the leading driver of global growth in the 2019-2028 period after having ceded this spot to China in the 2000s and 2010s.
The US’s contribution to global GDP growth in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010-2019 and 2019-2028 is 27.2%, 37.4%, 14.8%, 30.5% and (projected to be) 24.3%.
It is these numbers which put things in context vis-à-vis the global importance of Chinese and Indian economies.
Understanding the numbers
China is clearly past its prime as far as its importance as a driver of global growth is concerned. India’s importance is expected to increase, but there is merit in being circumspect about the claim that India has replaced China as the next global growth driver. If what is increasingly an inward-looking US is expected to remain the leading driver of global growth then one can expect that it is not going to create another China like it did in the 1990s.
There is more to this story.
One, global growth itself is much weaker now than what it was in the 2000s. IMF data shows that between 2000 and 2008, which is when the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) erupted, global GDP grew by more than 4% in three years and more than 5% in three years. If one were to exclude the base effect years of 2010 and 2021 which were preceded by a contraction in the global economy, global GDP growth has surpassed the 4% mark only once in the post-2008 period.
Also, while a GDP growth in the range of 6% to 6.5% is enough to make India the fastest growing global economy today, the Indian economy has had a better growth run in the past, especially in the 2000s. Back then the question used to be whether India could achieve a sustained double-digit growth phase. Double-digit growth is not even a part of the political rhetoric today.
To be sure, one can argue in hindsight that India’s pre-GFC boom was not without its problems. Irrational exuberance which was aided and abetted by India’s government-owned banks giving out huge loans without much of promoter skin in the game played a big role in driving in this boom. Once the GFC ended the global boom, the Indian economy was left to pick up the pieces of a twin balance sheet crisis which left both bank and company balance sheets scarred.
Looking ahead
If the pre-GFC growth in India was driven by irrational exuberance-driven investment, the post-pandemic growth seems to be driven by the consumption demand of the super-rich and perhaps an increase in debt-driven consumption by the not-so-rich. To be sure, just as the pre-GFC boom was not without an objective basis of a booming global economy and strong export demand, the current phase has had its own catalyst.
There is good reason to believe that India’s private sector salaried elite is now growing beyond the IT sector into areas such as start-ups and the next round of outsourcing in services in the form of Global Capability Centers (GCCs). While the consumption demand of this group is playing a major role in driving growth it cannot generate enough momentum to ensure even a sustained 8% plus GDP growth path for the Indian economy.
Where will India’s big driver for future growth come from?
There are different views on this question. The supply side view thinks the government's infra-boost will give a big push to India's long-term growth. There is also a demand side view which thinks the government must expand India's welfare net through programmes such as cash transfers or urban employment guarantee programmes to give a boost to mass demand. The truth, as is often the case, is more likely to be in between these two extremes and the question deserves more serious engagement than it is receiving at the moment.
While this is not to make a virtue of India’s Licence Raj era, sometimes one misses a Planning Commission-like institution which provided a platform for medium-term discussion (thanks to the five-year plans) on the economy within the confines of official policy-making circles with a lot of rigour.

Structural reforms are necessary to sustain India’s high growth trajectory and enable the nation to achieve developed country status by 2047
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its monetary policy statement on October 6, 2023, has reiterated that the economy will register Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 6.5% this year though it is expected to decelerate from 7.8% in the first quarter to 5.7% in the fourth. Other estimates by the rating agencies and multilateral banks are quite close to this estimate with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank projecting 6.3% and the Asian Development Bank keeping it at 6.4%. Although lower than last year’s 7.2% growth, the numbers are impressive: India continues to be the fastest-growing large economy in the world.

Currently, GDP growth is led predominantly by private consumption and public investment.(Representative image)
However, it would be too early to be euphoric. The Prime Minister would like to see India as a developed economy by the centenary year of Independence (2047), which, according to the World Bank definition, requires the economy to achieve a per capita income level of $13,205. The task is challenging as the economy will have to register an average annual growth of 8-9% over the next 20 years to achieve this.
Significant structural reforms need to be undertaken to achieve this aspirational target. Although the risks to growth are evenly balanced in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s assessment, a closer look at the economic outlook shows that the risks seem to weigh more on the negative side.
Equally important is the challenge of accelerating and sustaining growth in the medium- and long-term to address the structural problems, particularly reversing the decelerating trend in savings and investment. The poor monsoon this year is likely to adversely impact incomes from the agricultural sector and agro-processing industries and may dampen rural demand. In the medium-term, the decelerating supply of the household sector’s financial savings coupled with the continued draft on it by the government due to very high levels of fiscal deficit, are unlikely to spur private sector investments in the medium-term.
On average, the agricultural sector has been growing in the recent past at about 4%. However, a monsoon deficit of 5.6% from the long-period average this year is likely to impact the sector adversely. The RBI governor’s statement says that despite the deficit, the acreage under kharif (monsoon crop) cultivation is higher by 2%. However, wide variations in the temporal and regional spreads of the monsoon are likely to lower productivity, particularly in water-intensive crops. Besides, the acreage under cultivation of pulses is estimated to be lower by 4.9% and that will impact both outputs and prices. The significantly lower levels in reservoirs are also likely to have an adverse impact on the rabi (winter crop) output.
The manufacturing sector too is unlikely to show any stellar performance. Although the non-agricultural credit growth is high, the spike in personal credit, particularly for housing and vehicles, constitutes a substantial part of this. The services sector including public administration, defence, and other services is likely to perform well as elections are scheduled for five states in this financial year and the general election to Lok Sabha is likely to be held in early 2024. The PMI of both industry and services has continued to expand, but it remains to be seen whether the momentum will be maintained throughout the year.
The global slowdown, the protectionist trend in advanced Western countries, and international conflict situations are other factors dampening external demand. Even if in the current year the economy registers a growth of 6%, it will be high in the context of slower growth in most countries. Accelerating growth and sustaining it at about 8-9% to reach the status of a developed country by 2047, requires considerable reforms that must be implemented without much loss of time. Spurring domestic demand alone has not been adequate to accelerate and sustain high growth in any country that has experienced high growth over long periods of time: Most of them had to depend upon increasing exports to maintain the growth momentum. Competitiveness cannot be achieved by maintaining high levels of tariffs. Achieving competitive manufacturing requires undertaking domestic reforms, however difficult they are. Small firms account for over 75% of manufacturing employment. But with no incentive for them to grow and achieve an optimal economic size and scale, their competitiveness is lost. In fact, there are significant disincentives for the small to become medium and large. According to an OECD report, 77.6% of the persons in the age group of 25-64 years have education levels below the upper secondary level and even training them is going to be a challenge. The medium-term risks to growth are even more serious.
Currently, GDP growth is led predominantly by private consumption and public investment. Much of the household consumption has been financed by borrowings from financial institutions: The household sector’s financial savings as a ratio of GDP has shown a sharp decline to 5.1% in 2022-23 from 7.2% in the previous year. With a high fiscal deficit, there is hardly any borrowing space left for private investment. This is driving up the cost of borrowing. The decelerating levels of saving and investment can pose a major constraint in accelerating growth. Besides, attempts at fiscal consolidation will constrain the ability of the government to increase public investments. At the same time, a global slowdown, geopolitical tensions, and wars along with a protectionist policy environment do not show high prospects for growth acceleration through exports. In this environment, serious structural reforms to increase savings and investment, compress the fiscal deficit at the Union and state levels to ensure adequate availability of borrowing space to the private sector, and open up the economy and enhance competitiveness in Indian manufacturing are imperative. The challenge of achieving developed country status by 2047 is formidable but not impossible if such reforms are initiated.

While India continues to outperform major economies, the commentary about the state of the global economy is rather sober.
The Indian economy will grow faster than previously estimated this year, the International Monetary Fund said in its World Economic Outlook released Tuesday, and remain the world’s fastest growing major economy this year and next, but global growth will slow marginally next year even as global inflation rises faster than previously estimated.

The latest WEO data now expects India’s 2023-24 GDP growth to be 6.3%, a 20-basis point increase from the July numbers. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. The IMF’s 2023-24 growth forecast for India is now the same as what the World Bank had projected in its India Development Update on October 3. India’s 2024-25 GDP growth forecast has been left unchanged at 6.3% in the October WEO data. While the IMF’s upward revision of India’s 2023-24 GDP growth comes in the wake of a strong 7.8% growth in the quarter ending June 2023, the annual growth number is still lower than the 6.5% projection by RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee.

While India continues to outperform major economies, the commentary about the state of the global economy is rather sober. “The global economy is limping along, not sprinting”, IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog. IMF now expects global GDP growth to be 3% in 2023, which is the same as its July forecast. Global GDP growth for 2024, however, has seen a reduction of 10 basis points from the July forecast to 2.9%.
“Economic activity still falls short of its pre-pandemic path, especially in emerging market and developing economies”, the IMF said noting that even though the “likelihood of a hard landing has receded… the balance of risks to global growth remains tilted to the downside”.
Growth has lagged on account of tight monetary policies as central banks have kept money supply tight to fight inflation which rose to 8.7% in 2022. And it has logged on account of an uneven recovery from the pandemic and supply chain disruptions caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Hamas’ surprise assault on Israel last weekend threatens to destablise West Asia, a region that accounts for a third of the world’s oil production.
IMF expects inflation in 2024 to rise at 5.8%, faster than the 5.2% estimated three months and these projections do not reflect events of the weekend and their fallout.. “A fresh risk emerged in the form of the Israel-Palestinian conflict just as officials from 190 countries met in Marrakech for the IMF and World Bank annual meetings, but came after the IMF’s quarterly outlook update was locked down on Sept. 26”, a Reuters story said.
“It is too early to say how the major escalation would affect the global economy. Depending how the situation might unfold, there are many very different scenarios that we have not even yet started to explore, so we can’t make any assessment at this point yet”, IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told Reuters.
While not much has changed between the July and October editions of the WEO as far as growth in major economies is concerned, 2023 and 2024 projections signify a major downturn from 2022 performance. Global GDP growth is expected to fall by 50 basis points between 2022 and 2023 while advanced economies will grow at just 1.5% in 2023 compared to 2.6% in 2022. The Chinese economy is expected to grow at 5% in 2023, which is higher than the 3% it grew at in 2022. To be sure, this number needs to be read with the economic headwinds from China’s zero-Covid policy until last year. IMF’s October forecast for China’s 2023 and 2024 growth is 20 and 30 basis points lower than its July projections, which suggests that world’s second largest economy might be losing momentum. In fact, WEO flags China’s property sector crisis a potential downside risk for growth of emerging market and commodity exporting economies.
Apart from regular data on GDP growth projections, WEO strikes a slightly hawkish tone. “There is little margin for error on the policy front. Central banks need to restore price stability while using policy tools to relieve potential financial stress when needed…Fiscal policymakers should rebuild budgetary room for maneuver and withdraw untargeted measures while protecting the vulnerable”, IMF said in a clear call for monetary and fiscal tightening even as it highlighted the fact that global growth projections remains below the historical (2000-19) range of 3.8% and “forecasts for global growth over the medium term, at 3.1%, are at their lowest in decades, and prospects for countries to catch up to higher living standards are weak”.

RBI-MPC’s conservative stance on interest rate suggests that its focus is on keeping inflation low ahead of general election
The global economy is stuttering but the Indian economy is resilient. Data shows that the 2.5 percentage points increase in the policy interest rate effected between June 2022 and February 2023, has not been entirely transmitted by banks. Meanwhile, core inflation is declining, even as food inflation remains high, and overall inflation remains well above the upper tolerance band of the central bank. And both food and fuel prices could witness more volatility in the months to come.

With the next review meeting of RBI’s MPC only in December, much will depend on demand, urban and rural, in the ongoing festive season (REPRESENTATIVE PHOTO)
This is the reasoning behind the decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to keep the policy interest rate unchanged at 6.5%, and its policy stance on the withdrawal of accommodation. This is the fourth straight monetary policy review in which RBI has kept the rate unchanged, but reading between the lines, it is clear that the central bank is more worried about inflation than it is about growth. It has increased its second quarter (July-September) retail inflation estimate to 6.4% from 6.2%, although it has kept its projection for inflation for the entire year unchanged at 5.4%. It expects third quarter inflation to come down from the previously estimated 5.7% to 5.6% and has kept fourth quarter inflation unchanged at 5.2%. Finally, it has projected inflation at 5.2% in the first quarter of 2024-25 (April-June). RBI’s projection for second quarter inflation, and the fact that the print will reflect the impact of the cut in the price of LPG cylinders in late August, mean that September inflation, which will be released next week, will almost definitely show a significant drop from the previous month’s 6.8%. The trajectory of estimates points to the central bank meeting its target only sometime in 2024-25.
Given that RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has repeatedly stressed that the inflation target is 4%, and not 4% plus or minus 2%, and the possible threats on the horizon (Das’s statement lists pulses and onion production, global energy prices, and the El Nino phenomenon as risks), it can now be said with a reasonable level of certitude that there is unlikely to be a cut in the policy interest rate before the national election next summer. A cut would have been cheered both by industry and the middle class, which has seen mortgages becoming more expensive. On growth, RBI is more sanguine and has retained its estimate of 6.5% for the year, with government spending and urban demand driving the economic engine, as they have for some time. While the central bank suggests that private investment and rural demand may both be rising, there still isn’t enough in the numbers to show this. Indeed, anecdotal reports as well as the performance of some consumer product companies in rural markets show that rural demand is yet to pick up. To be sure, India has negotiated its economic challenges far better than many other countries.
With the next review meeting of RBI’s MPC only in December, much will depend on demand, urban and rural, in the ongoing festive season — demand usually peaks during this period, especially around Deepavali, which falls in November this year — and the performance of the kharif (or monsoon sown) agricultural season. Much will also depend on the direction of global crude prices; the current trend points southward, on the back of fears over declining demand and rising stockpiles.

ByRajeev Jayaswal

India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the country's rise to the fifth-largest economy in the world was due to a conscious strategy and political will. She emphasized that achieving the goal of becoming the third-largest economy would depend on political stability, policy consistency, and decisiveness. The Congress party criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi's guarantee of India's emergence as the third-largest economy, stating that it was an arithmetical inevitability. Sitharaman highlighted the efforts of the Indian people in driving the economy's growth and warned that any instability in political will would hinder economic performance.
New Delhi:The transformation of Indian economy from the world’s tenth largest to the fifth position in nine years is a result of conscious strategy and strong political will, according to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who on Thursday said that next journey to the third rank would not be a “fait accompli” as it would depend on “political stability”, “policy consistency” and “decisiveness” of the government.
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman (PTI)
Speaking at the annual day celebration of Sri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), Sitharaman said that steps taken under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi made India the fifth largest economy of the world.

While inaugurating the Bharat Mandapam on July 26, the Prime Minister assured the nation that in the third term of the BJP government, India will be among the top three economies in the world. “Yes, my friends, in the third term, India will be there with pride in the top three economies, and this is Modi’s guarantee,” he said that day.
Criticising his remarks, the Congress party said India’s emergence as the world’s third-largest economy is “guaranteed” regardless of who forms the government after the 2024 elections. “Typical of Mr. Modi to give his personal guarantee on an arithmetical inevitability. India’s emergence as the world’s 3rd largest economy in this decade has been predicted for quite some time now, and its guaranteed – whichever dispensation forms the next government,” Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said the same day.
Without referring to any opposition party or leader, Sitharaman on Thursday said: “It is the people of India who moved it [the economy] from tenth to fifth, and from fifth to the third. To say that it can be a ‘fait accompli’ and therefore, there’s no effort… is to undermine the people of India. People elected Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) with overwhelming majority twice – in 2014 and 2019. The next general election is due in the first half of 2024”.
The finance minister said people elected the Modi government twice because they “aspire for better” and their efforts are really pushing up the economy. They include entrepreneurs, farmers, and the economically weaker sections of the society aspiring for better, she said.
“You are students of economics. Will know that most often when we are talking about [an] explanation, a narrative; we normally take onboard ‘ceteris paribus’ … We always say, if other things remain constant this is what will happen…,” she said in reference to the government’s assertion that India would become the third largest economy of the world in the next five-year period of 2024-29.
She said despite all odds and global headwinds – starting from the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic to the Ukraine war and volatile global macroeconomic situation, including disruptions in supply of food, fuel and fertiliser -- the Indian government steered the economy well to achieve the fifth position.
While India has been able to navigate through all these problems, the global situation is still volatile because of geopolitical reasons, particularly the war, she said. “There was a time in 2022 when people thought [the war will] not [continue] beyond six months. But it’s going on,” she said pointing towards global supply-chain disruptions leading to hunger in many countries.
Any “flip-flop” in political will power would affect the economic performance and hinder the economic stability, she added.
She called SRCC as a premier “trend-setting” college of the country and said three of her personal staff were alumni of the institution. Two of them have moved to other promising areas – one in the administrative service and the other in politics, she added. Speaking about the third, she said: “I will wait to see where will he go now... all three of them contributed very well.”
She recalled former finance minister Arun Jaitley, SRCC alumnus, as a “phenomenal personality” and her “mentor”. He loved three things – food, Sri Ram College and Cricket, she said adding that he would talk “most often” about the three things than politics.

The gig economy presents a significant opportunity for women's entrepreneurship, and the government needs to support the private sector in its business models.
One of the pillars of India’s G20 women-led development agenda is the promotion of women’s entrepreneurship. According to several studies, if women were represented in the formal economy on par with men, the Indian economy would grow by an additional 60% by 2025, adding $2.9 trillion. At present, only about 14% of all enterprises in India are women-led businesses. The sixth economic census says that women entrepreneurs account for 13.76% (about 8.05 million) of the total entrepreneurs of 58.5 million in India. Undoubtedly, there has been a growth in the number of women entrepreneurs, but it has been patchy and slow and needs to be stepped up.
PREMIUM
The existing women-led enterprises employ 30% of India’s female workforce with the capability to create around 150 million jobs by 2030 (PIC FOR REPRESENTATION))
The existing women-led enterprises employ 30% of India’s female workforce with the capability to create around 150 million jobs by 2030. But there are many gaps that hold women back as identified by a research study by MicroSave Consultancy. One is the lack of space, capital, and support to get started. By and large, in India, we do not have physical incubation/acceleration spaces that recognise the unique challenges faced by women entrepreneurs. Among these are the need for shared services (legal, accounting), exhibition space, mentorship and peer to peer support. Women in tier 2 and tier 3 cities also need online/hybrid support that takes into account the time and mobility constraints of women entrepreneurs.
An enormous challenge that aspiring women entrepreneurs face is access to finance. Most financial products are not designed or delivered in a manner that is tailored to their needs. Issues around collateral and gendered approaches to loans lead to women having to borrow from the informal sector or remain in low capital/low growth enterprises. What we need are appropriate financing solutions which begin bottom up, tailored to the requirements of women entrepreneurs. The delivery and design of these cannot be based on the old models but through innovative approaches after consulting the women.
Yashodhara Bajoria, co-founder, CAXpert, an online accounting platform that provides low-cost accounting solutions and financial analytics to small business owners says, “Categorising entrepreneurs based solely on traditional factors like turnover and investments is limiting. To truly empower entrepreneurs, we need insights into their mindset and approach. Compliance psychology provides this crucial understanding. It not only aids resource allocation but also informed policy development. At CAXpert, we believe this is where meaningful change begins.”
Women entrepreneurs and aspiring ones have suffered for lack of a collective voice. There is no single collective focused on promoting women’s entrepreneurship. This has several fallouts, among them the lack of negotiating power, lack of agenda setting ability, lack of ability to shape the narrative on critical issues and a lack of visibility on tailwinds, trends and opportunities.
In the past, we have had models like SEWA and Lijjat papad, among a few others, that have shown what could work for mass women entrepreneurship. But beyond that, no new models which keep in mind changing technologies and access routes to finance have come up which can be scaled across geographies. There is also a significant gap in women’s entrepreneurship models designed for urban and rural areas.
The greatest potential today for women’s entrepreneurship lies in the gig economy, which is estimated to grow to 2.35 crore (23.5 million) workers by 2030. This has been boosted by the growing use of smartphones, internet penetration, education and digital payments infrastructure. The government has to do much more to support the private sector to identify, test and validate business models that are suitable for women entrepreneurs. The G20 summit has laid out the aspirations, now for the implementation.

Govt may want to keep grain prices under check. But hawkish monetary intervention from RBI could be counterproductive
India’s benchmark inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), grew at 6.8% in August, lower than the 7.4% print in July but higher than the 6% upper limit of RBI’s tolerance band. Wholesale prices, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), contracted by 0.5% in August, making it the fifth consecutive month of contraction. Lest there is confusion, it is important to reiterate that the widely divergent trends in CPI and WPI are not a reflection of prices in wholesale and retail markets. The two indices have very different compositions. WPI has a smaller weight for food, includes a lot of industrial inputs and does not have services. If one were to compare similar sub-components between these two indices, the trends are the same. Inflation continues to remain a problem for critical food items such as cereals and pulses, and it is benign for non-food, non-fuel items.

What does this mean for the Indian economy in the next few months?
With the base effect dissipating, WPI should get out of the contraction zone from next month. A month-on-month comparison shows that prices are actually increasing on a sequential basis. This is not a bad development because it will give some boost to the nominal GDP growth numbers, which serve as the base for tax revenues. A benign core inflation environment both in the retail and wholesale inflation numbers shows that the economy is well placed to enjoy the positive effects of a revival in the private capex cycle. While there are some signs of this happening, it is still not a given and at best work in progress.
The only problem, as far as the inflation numbers are concerned, is on the food grain (cereals, pulses) front given the prospects of a bad summer and winter harvest due to a weak monsoon at a time when inflation is already very high for these items. Pragmatically speaking, this is a terms-of-trade challenge for the fiscal arm of the government, which will have to do everything it can to control prices without increasing farmer anger in an election year. But India’s inflation targeting framework will force RBI to respond to it. A hawkish monetary intervention could end up being counterproductive given the nascent stage of private capex revival.

To be sure, almost all projections, including RBI’s, expect the annual growth number for 2023-24 to be lower than the June quarter numbers
Strong domestic demand driven by government capex and a continuing recovery in contact intensive services helped the Indian economy build on its growth momentum despite external headwinds in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.
HT Image
India’s GDP growth in the quarter ending June was 7.8%, the National Statistical Office (NSO) said in a release on August 31. The latest numbers are exactly in line with a projection by Bloomberg poll of economists and 1.7 percentage points more than the 6.1% number in the previous quarter. To be sure, the latest growth numbers are marginally below the 8% projection by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the RBI.

Indian economy’s “growth prospects appear bright” despite downward risks from external factors such as “firming of prices of crude oil” and “prolonged geopolitical uncertainty”, chief economic adviser (CEA) V Anantha Nageswaran said while commenting on the GDP numbers. Analysts concurred with CEA’s assessment, identifying a service sector driven boost to domestic economy activity as an effective antidote to the headwinds from external markets.
To be sure, almost all projections, including RBI’s, expect the annual growth number for 2023-24 to be lower than the June quarter numbers. This is more a reflection of the fact that the June quarter numbers enjoy a favourable base effect. RBI’s MPC resolution released in August projected a growth rate of 6.5% for 2023-24 with quarterly growth numbers being 8%, 6.5%, 6% and 5.7% in the quarters ending June 2023, September 2023, December 2023 and March 2024 respectively.
An expenditure-side analysis of the GDP numbers shows that private consumption and investment (as captured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation) numbers have played an important role in driving the growth momentum. While Private Final Consumption Expenditure increased by 6% on an annual basis, investment spending increased by 8%. This provided a crucial buffer to the headline GDP number despite a three-fold decline in net exports of goods and services driven by a fall in exports and rise in imports.
A look at the sector-wise Gross Value Added (GVA) numbers shows that services played an important role in building the growth momentum during this period. Services as a whole have grown by 10.3% on a year-on-year basis contributing almost three-fourth to the overall growth in GVA.
A slowdown in the global economy and trade may moderate export growth, but services sector would remain a key driver, CEA said identifying the sector as a key driver of economic momentum.
“Headline growth was driven higher by continued momentum in the tertiary sector, even as the primary and secondary sectors were generally weaker compared to the previous quarter,” Rahul Bajoria, head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics Research, Barclays, said in a note. “For FY 23-24, we maintain our forecast of 6.3%, but see modest upside risks to our forecast. Domestic demand is likely to anchor GDP growth, but some moderation may come from weaker manufacturing and exports in a global slowdown,” the note added.
Another important aspect of the latest GDP numbers is the near congruence in real and nominal growth numbers with the latter being just 20 basis points – one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point – more than the latter. This is likely a result of fall in commodity prices – the wholesale price index contracted by 2.6% in the June quarter – which has given both a real and statistical boost to constant price numbers. In fact, in some sub-sectors including manufacturing, nominal growth numbers are lower than the real growth number. While declining commodity prices have played a role in bringing down core inflation, a moderation in nominal growth can have an adverse impact on revenue collections for the government.
To be sure, the economic policy landscape at the current juncture might be very different from what the June numbers suggest because of the performance of the monsoon season.
With August 2023 being the driest since 1901, even a normal rainfall in September – which is what the IMD has projected on August 31 – could leave to a significant rainfall deficit in the monsoon season this year notwithstanding the fact that it might not meet the technical threshold for being a deficient monsoon year. This is likely to give a further boost to inflation for key food items such as cereals which are already at uncomfortable levels. Cereal inflation came in at 13% in July 2023, making it the 12th consecutive month of double-digit inflation in the subcategory.
While the impact of deficient rains in August needs to be watched, food inflation is likely to subside with the arrival of fresh stock in the market and the government’s pre-emptive measures, CEA said. Although inflation rose in June and July 2023, India’s dynamics are still better compared to other economies as core inflation is declining and the food inflation is transitory, he added.
“While the government has taken multiple steps to control food and overall inflation, including the reduction in prices of LPG cylinders earlier this week, experts believe that these might effect collateral damage in terms of worsening of terms of trade for farmers. With production already likely to take a hit due to deficient rainfall in large parts and floods in key states such as Punjab, aggressive price control measures will entail a double whammy for farmers, which is bound to hurt rural demand,” said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University.
“The fall in commodity prices has led to buoyant economic activity over the last few quarters. This has been visible in higher corporate margins and improved purchasing power. Going forward, the intensification of the El Nino weather phenomenon is the biggest risk to the rural economy and overall GDP growth. Already, we find that rural indicators such as real rural wages and non-durables consumption, are weakening. As the base normalises, and rural demand comes under pressure led by the El Nino, we expect GDP growth prints to slow from here on, averaging 5.8% in FY24,” said Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India and Indonesia Economist.
Given the precarious situation around food prices, the government’s political fortunes – there is less than a year to go for the 2024 general elections and the penultimate state election cycle is scheduled for end of this year – are more likely to depend on its management of this inflation-rural income contradiction rather than headline growth numbers.

The economy is doing well despite headwinds. But keep a watch on rainfall and food prices
India’s GDP grew at 7.8% in the quarter ending June 2023, exactly what a Bloomberg poll of economists predicted and broadly in line with the 8% forecast by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its August resolution. Given the fact that there are no surprises in the headline number, what do the latest GDP statistics tell us about the economy? Here are three key takeaways.

What do the latest GDP statistics tell us about the economy? Here are three key takeaways.(Representative image)
The first message is that the Indian economy continues to do well despite headwinds on the external front. 7.8% growth, whichever way one looks at it, is a good number, and it looks even more impressive in the wake of the fact that exports have fallen compared to the same period last year and imports have increased. While the international economic environment continues to remain volatile, strength in domestic economic activity is clearly good news.
The second key message requires reading the real and nominal numbers together. In some important sectors such as manufacturing, trade and other services, the real growth number is higher than the nominal growth number on a year-on-year basis. This confirms the point made by some analysts that the latest numbers have some element of statistical boost due to methodological issues around the use of a deflator (to remove the effect of inflation from the numbers). To be sure, they do not take away from the fact that the economy continues to do well.
The third and most important takeaway is that even at this point in time in September, the political economy situation may have changed significantly compared to what the June quarter numbers show. Rainfall performance up to August and IMD’s projections for September indicate a high likelihood of monsoon being deficient in large parts of the country. This, given the already high levels of inflation in key food items such as cereals and pulses, might generate tailwinds for food inflation. The government’s aggressive intervention in food markets confirms that it is not oblivious to this threat. While its policies might help control food inflation, they are likely to worsen terms of trade for farmers, in turn generating headwinds for rural demand. This would not matter so much in a normal year, given agriculture’s low weight in national income, but it has the potential of generating political discontent in a pre-election year. The government’s central economic challenge, going forward, will be maintaining this fine balance between inflation and farm incomes.

Our regulations are increasingly restrictive and create a compliance load. We should not be crimping our nation’s entrepreneurship
My most fervent wish about India is that all Indians have the chance of a life worth living. It is not in doubt that India will become the world’s third largest economy before the decade is over. But to join the ranks of developed nations by our 100th year of Independence, we will need to increase the productivity of our human capital and better use our domestic capital. I have often talked about the need to invest handsomely in our soft infrastructure; however, the focus of this piece is on giving some freedom to our entrepreneurs in the use of domestic capital.
PREMIUM
All countries grow on the back of domestic capital augmented by foreign capital, not the other way round
There is a lot of talk around domestic capital formation and disappointment that the savings rate has come down below 30%. There is also discussion around improving the liquidity and depth in our bond markets. However, there is not much discussion on how the capex cycle really runs in India and what is needed to give it a boost. Arguing a sui generis case for India in the face of established theory is always a lonely path, but one that I will embark on in this piece.
The Indian economy is very different in its structure from the economies of the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) on multiple dimensions - in the stage of development, in the depth and liquidity of equity markets, and in the importance of family owned and managed businesses. India is a bank-led economy. Savings are intermediated through banks. Equity participation is very low. If we go to rural areas, the highest form of savings is in land, followed by gold. Financial savings are deposits mostly in nationalised banks. Countries such as Japan and even Europe are more akin to us, than the US and UK. This said, the US and UK have had the largest impact on our financial regulations.
At Independence, there were many in the UK that expected us to implode. In fact, the need for bank nationalisation in 1969 was part recognition that no foreign commercial capital was available to India. We needed to find our own resources within India. Bank nationalisation helped give confidence to depositors. Rapid rural branch opening helped garner their deposits. Bank branches more than doubled from 8,000 to 18,730 – as rural and semi- urban branches increased to 12,405. By 1990, India had almost 60,000 branches, of which 46,115 were in rural and semi-urban areas, raising ₹3,14,823 crore in bank deposits.
The deposits raised were invested in national priorities by mandating the banks to buy approved government securities to meet the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) which was set at 35%. Cash reserve ratio, the deposits banks held with Reserve Bank of India (RBI), was set at 15%. Thus, 50% of bank deposits raised were impounded. The residual assets were also directed. Defined priority sectors got 40% of advances and corporate credit was largely allocated through the credit authorisation scheme run by RBI. Project finance was provided by development finance institutions that had access to concessional liabilities from RBI. Retail credit was barely available. Clearly, the structure of a capital-starved economy.
Entrepreneurship was either through the State or through family-owned and managed businesses. This largely remains the structure today (except for recent startups) with more than 300 of the top 500 Indian companies being family-owned. Most micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are also family-owned. It is true that prior to the reforms in 1992, the promoter had enormous fungibility in the use of a company’s capital. This led, at times, to a misappropriation of capital for private gain, by some less scrupulous business groups (without even a majority stake). However, history also shows us that because of this flexibility in the use of company funds, a Tata Steel could start Tata Motors, or a Tata Industries could start Titan. The same was true of other industrial conglomerates.
The International Monetary Fund-influenced reforms of 1992 insisted on much greater tightening of these rules in line with US best practice and at the behest of foreign financial institutions. The use of company capital became much more restrictive than before. This trend continues to accelerate, inspired by economies that are equity led and at a different stage of development. As a result, we are now very protective of the interests of minority shareholders. Foreign investors, especially from the West, inhibit capital investments in other businesses by asset-rich and liquidity poor promoters. The investors from the Middle East and Far East understand conglomerates better. In the early 20th century, the prevailing orthodoxy in the US was also different from what our entrepreneurs experience today.
Our regulations are increasingly restrictive and prescriptive, and create an enormous compliance load. We must question whether rules are needed on market rumours in social media, and why the public needs to know family arrangements. By and large, Indian companies have been the engines of India’s growth, they have provided jobs and been considerate employers. If some misuse funds for private gains, we should prosecute them. But our regulatory structure should not be created for thieves, it should be created for wealth-creating industrialists. We should not be crimping our own entrepreneurship, not at this time.
We need to recognise that all countries grow on the back of domestic capital augmented by foreign capital, not the other way round. The finance minister was on point in her budget this year, asking for a comprehensive review of our financial regulations with public and regulated entity participation. The announcement could not have come a day too soon.

Understanding the problem of price rise in the country
How bad is the inflation problem in the Indian economy? First, RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) issued some hawkish rhetoric on the inflation problem. This was followed by a higher than expected 7.44% inflation print in the month of July. We are now witnessing aggressive government intervention in food markets. An HT analysis shows that while the Indian economy is far from overheating, food price pressures are likely to keep the government on its toes as the 2024 elections come closer. Here are four charts which explain this in detail.

The government launches campaigns for inclusive development, but amendments to Forest Conservation Act may harm the poorest citizens.
Economists are arguing fiercely about the direction of the Indian economy. Does the prime minister (PM) believe industrialisation is the way ahead or is he trying to develop an inclusive economy? When he coined the phrase Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas (development with all, for all) he seemed firmly set on the inclusive way forward. Then, there were also schemes to benefit individuals such as building lavatories, distribution of domestic gas cylinders, and the encouragement to open bank accounts. There was also the Swachh Bharat or Clean India campaign. However, the tribal region of Madhya Pradesh, which I know well, doesn’t seem much cleaner. Many of the built lavatories are being used for storage. It seems as if these schemes may not have been as successful as suggested by the Press Information Bureau (PIB) and reiterated by some television networks that have become accustomed to toeing the government’s line.

In India, the poorest of the poor live in the forests and are dependent on them for their livelihood. (HT file)
The PM seems to have furthered his image of a man who believes that inclusive economics needed another boost. On April 21, PIB announced that the PM would be launching nine campaigns under the theme of Samaveshi Vikas or inclusive development. Among the areas to be covered are employment, health, social inclusion, social security and livelihood creation.
Of course, there is a website and a mobile app. There is clearly politics involved in these inclusive programmes as they were launched from Madhya Pradesh, which is headed for an assembly election this year. But this week, the two Houses of Parliament passed an amendment to the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 which shows that PM Narendra Modi still wants to go ahead with privatisation for accelerating the growth rate of India, but for which the poor might pay a price. This is the liberal economy seen in the case of former British PM, Margaret Thatcher, which swept aside so many of the benefits of the poor won by previous socialist governments.
In India, the poorest of the poor live in the forests and are dependent on them for their livelihood. They are the ones who will be the hardest hit by the amendments to the Forest Conservation Act. In the now famous case of the Niyamgiri forests, the tribals forced the mining giant Vedanta to abandon its plans to mine bauxite in the hills. Noted environmentalist Sharachchandra Lele recently argued that these hills are not notified forests, and according to the amendment, mining can now start again.
The state of Odisha faces this problem in other forests as well, as do the northeastern states. The northeastern states are also threatened by the Centre’s ability to construct linear projects within 100 km of any international border. A linear project could mean a connection between two places, not just roads and railways but also possibly drainage systems, airports, pylons and plenty of other things. The Centre stated that the linear projects will be of “national importance and concerning national security”. And who decides this? The central government. The amendments, as a whole, undermine Indian federalism. The Northeast shares international borders with China, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, and it has problems with all of them. The amendments to the forest law could create further challenges for the security forces of the region.
Of course, there is a threat to its forests as well. And the amendments also open the gates to developers looking to profit from the Northeast’s natural wealth. Some experts have argued that the commercialisation of the Northeast and the forests of central India is one of the main aims of the amendments. Is this the price we have to pay for development?

The banking sector has made significant progress in addressing the NPA crisis representing a shift towards a more transparent and responsible financial future.
To understand the complexities of India’s banking sector, one needs to grapple with a term that tends to recur with unsettling regularity – non-performing assets (NPA). In the realm of banking, NPAs serve as ominous indicators of systematically flawed lending practices. The NPA crisis once cast long and haunting shadows on the integrity of our financial institutions. It posed a troubling question: How could so many loans, particularly to large corporations, turn bad? The answer, distressingly, was a tangled web of non-transparency, political interference, and systemic corruption that was allowed to thrive unchecked under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. This culture of irresponsible lending led to a surge in willful defaulters. These unfortunate missteps were not mere policy oversights. They represented a fundamental disregard for the principles of accountability, transparency, and fiscal prudence, which are critical to the robust functioning of any banking system.

The NPA situation in India before 2014 was severe. The gross NPA ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) stood at 4.9%, and ₹66.6 lakh crore in March 2014 were bad loans. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government took several steps to address the NPA problem, including setting up a new bad bank, the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC), to take over the management of stressed assets; introducing the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) 2016, which provided a framework for the resolution of stressed assets; and increasing the provisioning requirements for banks. Systematic and continuous efforts in the last nine years have effected a turnaround of the banking sector with robust growth. As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), scheduled commercial banks’ NPA ratio fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023.
Public Sector Banks (PSBs) have also come a long way as their profits touched ₹1,04,649 crore in 2022-23. 12 PSBs witnessed a 57% increase in total profit compared to ₹66,539.98 crore earned in 2021-22. India’s largest lender, the State Bank of India, reported net NPAs of nearly ₹66,000 crore in 2018, but this came down drastically to ₹21,000 crore in FY23. The net NPA ratio also decreased. For FY23, SBI’s net profit crossed ₹50,000 crore, witnessing a growth of 58.6% year on year basis. Top private banks also have an NPA of less than 1%, and have posted huge profits. Private bank profits in FY23 were led by HDFC Bank at ₹36,961 crore, ICICI Bank at ₹23,339 crore, and Axis Bank at ₹13,025 crore.
PSBs are now utilising third-party data for in-depth due diligence at the loan sanctioning stage, mitigating risks from misrepresentation and fraud. The introduction of special mention accounts helps in the early detection of potential stress indicators in debt servicing, allowing banks to take preventative action against possible NPAs.
Comprehensive, automated early warning systems with around 80 triggers are being used by banks for timely remedial actions, enabling proactive stress detection and NPA reduction. Borrowers’ repayment behaviour is reported to credit information companies, which banks then use to inform their loan-sanctioning decisions, promoting better loan repayment habits.
As per the Economic Survey 2022-2023, the efforts of RBI and the government in terms of calibrated policy measures such as strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework, implementation of the 4R approach of Recognition, Resolution, Recapitalisation and Reforms have culminated in the enhancement of risk absorption capacity and a healthier banking system balance sheet, both in terms of asset quantity and quality over the years. Today, we can confidently say that India’s banking sector, once embroiled in an NPA crisis, is well-positioned for sustainable growth, with a robust infrastructure that is more transparent, accountable, and resilient. The turnaround story scripted by the government signifies more than a successful policy implementation; it represents a shift in the economic ethos towards a more prudent and responsible financial future.
This transformation, underpinned by the principle of good governance, has set the stage for India to emerge as one of the top three economies in the coming years.

The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) contracted by 4.12% in June reaching its lowest value since October 2015
NEW DELHI: Wholesale prices contracted for the third consecutive month in June on the back of lower prices of manufactured items, reiterating the fact that falling commodity prices are contributing to a cost deflation in the Indian economy.
Vegetable prices contracted by 21.98% while pulses and milk witnessed inflation rates of 9.21% and 8.59%. (PTI File)
The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) contracted by 4.12% in June reaching its lowest value since October 2015 according to the data released by the ministry of commerce and industry on July 14 (Friday).

Even in absolute terms, the WPI index was 149 in June, the lowest since March 2022. The WPI data has come days after Consumer Price Index (CPI) accelerated by 0.5 percentage points to reach 4.8% in June on the back of higher food prices. The June CPI and WPI values are the latest the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will look at when it meets in August to decide on interest rates. Most economists expect RBI to continue with the pause in interest rate hikes for an extended period, without dropping its guard on inflation.
The June WPI sprang a big positive surprise. A Bloomberg poll of economists had a median projection of 3.3% contraction in WPI for the month of June. With the latest inflation number, the wholesale price inflation for the quarter ending June 2023 is (-)2.8%. To be sure, one reason for the lower WPI print in the June quarter is a favourable base effect as the index grew in double digits for 18 consecutive months from April 2021.
A disaggregated analysis of WPI shows that prices are contracting across all major categories. Manufactured products, which have a two-thirds share in the WPI basket, saw a contraction of 2.7% in June. Primary articles saw a contraction of 4.1% and fuel and power category saw a contraction of 12.6%. Food items, which include both primary and manufactured products, saw an annual contraction of 1.2% in wholesale prices. Vegetable prices contracted by 21.98%, while pulses and milk witnessed inflation rates of 9.21% and 8.59%.
“The decline in the rate of inflation in June, 2023 is primarily due to fall in prices of mineral oils, food products, basic metals, crude petroleum & natural gas and textiles,” the commerce ministry said in a statement.
Going forward, experts believe that WPI will continue to maintain a deflationary trend despite some upside risks. “Reversal in base effects from July and seasonal rise in food prices may put some upside pressure on WPI in the near term, but falling commodity prices and therefore, input costs, may continue to keep it in deflation in y-o-y (year-on-year) terms,” said Rahul Bajoria, managing director and head of EM Asia (ex-China) economics, Barclays, in a note.

Through Indian immigrants and Indian traditions, Modi has now begun to influence the internal politics of other democracies throughout the world.
What makes June 21, 2015, different from June 21, 2023? When Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi performed yoga with thousands as part of Yoga Day eight years ago, others dismissed it as a “show” by a political “showman”. The significance of such showmanship in politics, diplomacy, and public life was evident in New York this time around.

When Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi performed yoga with thousands as part of Yoga Day eight years ago, others dismissed it as a “show” by a political “showman”.
Modi practised yoga with delegates from 183 countries on the North Lawn of the United Nations (UN) Headquarters on that day. Until recently, his predecessors used to utilise their overseas trips to promote domestic politics. Through Indian immigrants and Indian traditions, Modi has now begun to influence the internal politics of other democracies throughout the world. As yet, prior to him, no Indian PM has recognised this power.
Its first impressions began to emerge shortly after ‘Howdy Modi’ was held on September 22, 2019, in Texas. Addressing an Indian crowd in the presence of then United States (US) President Donald Trump, the PM demonstrated to the entire world for the first time that these are the days of Indian pride. Modi was aware that the number of non-resident Indians in the US is close to 4.5 million. They play a vital role in the local political, social, and economic landscape. This is why, like Trump, president Joe Biden has indicated his resolve to deepen ties with these voters via Modi. In a democracy, nothing is more vital than the voter and his/her vote.
Consequently, India and the Indian diaspora are becoming increasingly significant to western countries, including the US. Indian immigrants in Africa were already powerful enough.
The US is the most powerful country in the world, and we are the largest democracy. It is easy to argue that, in the shifting global geopolitical landscape, the US needs India and India needs the US. Can you envisage such relations between the US and Afghanistan, or between the US and Russia? Successful partnerships cannot be formed solely based on necessities.
Take Pakistan for example. We fought four wars against that country. It continues to wage a shadow war against us, costing billions of dollars and human lives each year. Despite this, why have our social ties with Pakistan remained? Language, culture, cuisine, and people-to-people relationships never change.
Similarly, the way the Indian diaspora has reinforced its standing in nations such as the US, Australia, and the United Kingdom has made dialogue between the government in New Delhi and their leaders easier.
I was in Singapore and Malaysia last week. On this five-day trip, I had to deal with four interpreters. Those with me in Singapore were of Chinese ancestry. They kept emphasising that we have more than 9% Tamils here, who make significant contributions to the country. They brought up PM Modi’s name often during the conversations. This has never happened before. The same was true about Malaysia. In reality, the Indian diaspora has a strong sense of optimism about India today. If you don’t believe me, look at the news from last Thursday. There were two more news pieces, both of which were prominently published along with Modi’s yoga event. The Indian stock market had reached a new high, and gold prices had dropped by ₹360. The data from the last three years show that, despite Covid and the Russia-Ukraine war, the Indian economy outperformed expectations. Despite rising prices and unemployment, the Indian market and buyers remain optimistic. Covid-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war have pushed Europe into a recession, but the Indian markets have returned to glory.
It’s no surprise that many economists believe India will dominate for the next 15 years.
Indeed, India and people of Indian origin have come a long way. I recall the time when Mahendra Pal Chaudhary, a person of Indian origin, was elected PM of Fiji in 1999. His government survived just a year in power with great difficulty. On May 27, 2000, the majority of his cabinet and he himself were captured by Opposition leader George Speight and rebel forces.
At present, Rishi Sunak is the PM of Britain, making Indians all around the world feel proud. The country that left us poor 75 years ago is now in the hands of an Indian. Today, CEOs of Indian origin lead 25 of the world’s top 500 corporations. People of Indian origin have a voice in parliaments, ministries, and in big institutions on every continent. There is no better time than now to breathe new life into the “India story” that former PM Manmohan Singh once crafted.
PM Narendra Modi is doing an exemplary job in this regard.

It can sometimes be useful to carve out a “then and now” scenario mapping to gauge changes on how the needle has moved on the scale of time. Some markers are more visible and pronounced than others.

There are striking dissimilarities between May 2020 and May 2023. Three years ago, the world was staring at an uncertain path as the Covid-19 pandemic swept through the world.
We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
Last three years the pandemic devastated economies. Across the world, policy makers rummaged through options to save their economies and limit the debilitating consequences on lives and livelihoods.
India also came out with Press Note 3, aimed at curbing predatory takeovers by foreign entities, needs to be reviewed in the current economic situation.
As companies across the globe battled the uncertainty that the pandemic brought on in 2020, several economies began to raise concerns about opportunistic takeovers of entities stressed by pandemic in their country.
India introduced Press Note 3 (PN3) in 2020, which required all foreign direct investment (FDI) proposals from an entity based in a country that shares a land border with India, or where the beneficial owner of such FDI is situated in a country which shares a land border with India — both referred to as “restricted entities” — were brought under the government approval route.
The Press Note expanded the list of countries whose investors are no longer eligible to invest in India under the automatic route. Importantly, for start-ups, an investment in India now falls under the government route if it is from an entity whose ""beneficial owner"" is from such a bordering country.
The term beneficial owner has different meanings under different laws in India. Depending on how it is defined it could mean (i) an entity with a prescribed shareholding level in the investing entity (as is the case under the Companies Act of 2013) or (ii) the owner or holder of ultimate control over the investing entity (as defined under the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002). A somewhat similar concept is also used by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to identify the ultimate beneficial owner for the purposes of certain securities laws.
It is a very different world now in May 2023. The pandemic’s in retreat. There’s now an unmistakable excitement and optimism about India, even at a time when large parts of the developed world stare at an imminent recession.
The Economic Survey 2022-2023 has put India’s medium-term Gross Domestic Product growth potential between 7-8%. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says India will grow 6.1% in 2023-24 and accelerate further to 6.8% in 2024-25, firmly cementing India as a powerful growth engine. Economists agree that India is on track to be the third largest within five years.
More importantly, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that Covid-19 no longer represents a ""global health emergency"".
The statement marks an end to the pandemic and comes three years after it first declared its highest level of alert over the virus.
Reports suggested that virus' death rate had dropped from a peak of more than 100,000 people per week in January 2021 to just over 3,500 on 24 April.
The government has approved 98 foreign direct investment (FDI) proposals from countries sharing land border with India since April 2020 out of 423 received from sectors including trading and electronics.
On a net basis, FDI inflows into India fell 27% to $28.014 billion in FY23 from $38.59 billion in FY22. In the last 10 years, this is the first fall in FDI in the country.
This may be the right time to roll back some policies such as Press Note 3 2020 that were introduced as a precaution to shield the pandemic’s effect on the Indian economy.
The funding winter for Indian start-ups has lasted well into the sweltering summers. These enterprises are innovators and job generators. Adequate capitalisation of start-ups by removing policy barriers is necessary for the Indian economy to canter to its full potential.

‘We may be creating the ground for perverse incentives’
He said the concept of Universal Social Security is not favourable for developing countries like India which need to focus on economic growth to take care of the aspirations of its people.

""For our country, when natural economic growth should take care of many of the aspirations, it (Universal Social Security) may not be necessary. We may be creating the ground for perverse incentives for people to not make their own effort in seeking such opportunities. So therefore, Universal Social Security for India is not something that should be on the agenda in the near term,"" he said at an event here.
However, he said, support should be confined to those who may not be able to participate in economic activities and bring them up to a point where they can meaningfully engage in the economy.
India has not reached the stage where it is a moral or economic necessity to have Universal Social Security, he added.

Former CEA mooted the idea of a uniform stipend
It is to be noted that former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian during the first term of the Narendra Modi government had mooted the idea of a uniform stipend to citizens.
Subramanian in the Economic Survey 2016-17 had proposed the idea of universal basic income (UBI) or a uniform stipend to every adult and child, poor or rich.
The survey said UBI would guarantee all citizens enough income to cover their basic needs and would be easier to administer than the current anti-poverty schemes, which are plagued by waste, corruption and abuse.
'We need 3-5 years of 10 per cent steady nominal GDP growth'
With regard to Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM), Nageswaran said, the overall goal of ensuring fiscal stainability has not gone away at all even though the mechanism for doing so might vary depending on the compulsions of the time.
So, he said, a 4.5 per cent gross fiscal deficit ratio is in place.
In the Budget speech, Finance Minister Niramala Sitharaman said the fiscal deficit in 2022-23 was estimated at 6.4 per cent of GDP, which was consistent with the broad path of fiscal consolidation announced by her to reach a fiscal deficit level below 4.5 per cent by 2025-26.
To achieve the target, Nageswaran said, ""All we need to achieve is 3-5 years of 10 per cent steady nominal GDP growth and all these fiscal parameters will automatically improve because our growth rate is higher than the cost of borrowing.""
Nageswaran on public debt
India's gross debt was at 81 per cent of GDP in 2005 which increased to 84 per cent now, he said, adding, only two other countries have done better than India -- Indonesia and Germany with a 2 per cent slippage in the overall debt to GDP ratio.
""Many other countries in the G20 and beyond have seen a slippage in their debt ratio by an order of magnitude of 40 to 80 percentage points...we are at least held steady and we are a country which has a potential to grow in nominal terms between 10 and 11 per cent
""All that being said, I will also concede that we are at BBB minus. Even a country like the Philippines, which is much smaller than us has a BBB plus credit rating. And that means if you go from BBB minus to BBB plus your government's cost of borrowing will come down by 100 basis points and that is a fiscal stimulus,"" he said.
So, good fiscal health would translate into a good fiscal stimulus for citizens because interest rates will come down, he said.
""So we are aware of that and we are working towards it. Asset monetization and natural economic growth should help.
""There is no second opinion on the importance of keeping at it and achieving these numbers and getting to a better credit rating because it's not just a question of prestige, it's a question of actually putting more money in the hands of people through lower interest rates,"" he said.
He also said improving macroeconomic parameters have raised the prestige of India at the global forum.
Sharing a personal experience, he said, his son, who was born in Singapore and currently studies in America made a statement that ""nowadays even in the US, it is very cool to be an Indian. Modiji has made it very cool to be an Indian.""
CEA on artificial intelligence
Nageswaran also cautioned the IT industry to be prepared for the onslaught of Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacting their growth.
""Artificial Intelligence can take away the need for a lot of people. Indian software exporters. Therefore, we need to be cautious about whether AI will make a competitive threat to India's IT-enabled services growth. So, we need to think ahead and plan ahead. AI make a competitive threat to India's IT sector growth,"" he said.
Talking about the resilient Indian economy, he said it is in a state of autopilot, bouncing back impressively after the pandemic and expected to grow in a range of 6.5-7 per cent in the current fiscal.
Sharing his optimism on the medium-term growth prospects of the Indian economy, he said that the sound macroeconomic policies of the government, structural reforms, such as GST, IBC etc, thrust on infrastructure and digitalisation, have ensured that the Indian economy can grow for a longer period without running into overheating problems.
CEA on investments, private consumption and inflation
On capex, he said that the private sector is poised to attain stronger investment growth following the strengthening of corporate balance sheets, and stronger bank balance sheets, which has improved their ability to lend and support from the government's capex push.
Over the medium term, investments will remain a key driver of growth. The uptick in investments will drive the manufacturing output too, he said at the CII event here.
Private consumption, which contributes close to 60 per cent to GDP, has surpassed the pre-pandemic trend in the third quarter of last fiscal contributed by the release of pent-up demand and recovery in rural demand, he said.
Going ahead, he said, a lower inflation outlook due to easing commodity prices, good harvest and pass-through of lower input costs, will have a salutary impact on boosting the consumption spending further this fiscal.

GDP numbers exceeded the government’s own projections and was the result of a better-than-expected performance in the last quarter of the fiscal
The Indian economy grew at 7.2% in the fiscal year 2022-23, positively surprising most analysts and exceeding the government’s own projection of 7% GDP growth. The unexpected upside in the GDP numbers is a result of a better-than-expected performance in the last quarter of the fiscal, and powered by services, exports, and agriculture. GDP growth in the quarter ending March 2023 was 6.1%, which is a full percentage point higher than the median forecast of 5.1% by a Bloomberg poll of economists. Second advance estimates for 2022-23 GDP – they were released on February 28, 2023 – had also assumed a 5.1% growth in the March quarter. The latest numbers vindicate RBI governor Shaktikanta Das who, on May 24, said that the 2022-23 GDP numbers could end up being higher than the projected 7% figure.

While the 2022-23 annual GDP growth number is lower than the 9.1% print for 2021-22, it needs to be remembered that the 2021-22 growth was on the back of a 5.8% contraction in 2020-21. RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) expects the economy to grow at 6.5% in 2023-24.

“The 2022-23 GDP growth figures underscore the resilience of the Indian economy amidst global challenges. This robust performance along with overall optimism and compelling macro-economic indicators, exemplify the promising trajectory of our economy and the tenacity of our people,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet.
A disaggregated analysis of the latest GDP numbers shows that consumption and investment have emerged as key drivers of growth. At 34%, the share of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) – it measures investment spending – in overall GDP is the highest since 2012-13. However, a lack of momentum in manufacturing – it shows an annual growth of just 1.3% – continues to be a cause of concern. Services, on the other hand, have grown at 9.5%. Trade, hotels, transport, communication and broadcasting services, which has the largest employment share within services has shown an annual growth of 14% in 2022-23.
To be sure, the headline annual and quarterly GDP numbers hide a variation in key drivers of growth in the first and second half of the fiscal. For example, private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) grew at just 2.2% and 2.8% in the quarters ending December 2022 and March 2023 compared to the 19.8% and 8.3% values in the quarters ending June 2022 and September 2022. This suggests that some of the consumption boost in 2022-23 could have been pent-up demand that has since ebbed.
GFCF growth was an impressive 8% and 9% in the quarters ending December 2022 and March 2023. Reading the GFCF numbers with government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) clearly shows that the government has shifted the fiscal ballast from revenue spending to capital spending. Annual GFCE growth in 2022-23 is just 0.1%, and it actually saw a contraction in the September and December quarters.
A sustained revival in the investment cycle, however, will require a healthy growth in private consumption growth, which as per the latest quarterly numbers, seems to be losing momentum.
Export and import numbers suggest that the economy has gained significantly due to imports slowing down much more than exports. While goods and services exports grew at 11.1% and 11.9% in the quarters ending December 2022 and March 2023, import growth was 10.7% and 4.9% in these periods.
“March quarter GDP growth came in much higher than expected, led by stronger agriculture, manufacturing, investment and exports. Some of the strength may have been led by statistical factors, i.e. the practice of single deflation in calculating GDP growth. The informal sector has rebounded recently, but with global growth slowing, softer domestic growth prints could follow,” said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India and Indonesia economist at HSBC research, in a note.
“We expect GDP to grow 5.5% in FY24. We expect the RBI to be on hold for the rest of the year, and cut the repo rate by 25bps in 1Q2024,” Bhandari added.
“For FY 23-24, despite today’s upside surprise, we maintain our forecast of 6.3%, with domestic demand driving the rise and the moderation coming largely from weaker manufacturing and exports in a global slowdown. We forecast continued steady GDP growth of 6.5% in FY 24-25. With inflation moderating and expected to stay close to the target, we think the window for rate hikes has closed. We expect RBI to remain on hold at its MPC meeting next week,” Rahul Bajoria, MD and head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics, Barclays, said in a note.

20% TCS rule update: No tax for international transactions up to ₹7 lakh through debit cards or credit cards
The government issued a clarification on Friday stating that a 20% Tax Collection at Source (TCS) will be applicable only to overseas credit card transactions exceeding ₹7 Lakh.
20% Tax Collection at Source for credit cards online transactions rule update
An official statement addressed concerns about the applicability of TCS to small transactions under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) from July 1, 2023. To eliminate procedural ambiguity, it was decided that individual payments up to ₹7 lakh per financial year made using international debit or credit cards would be excluded from the LRS limits and therefore not subject to TCS.

The government order also confirmed that the existing beneficial TCS treatment for education and health payments would continue. Furthermore, any other necessary changes to the Rules (Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions Rules), 2000) would be issued separately.
Previously, on Thursday, the government announced the inclusion of credit card transactions in foreign currency under the LRS and the implementation of a 20% TCS starting July 1, 2023. These transactions were not previously considered part of the LRS framework. (Also Read: Experts criticise decision to tax credit card usage in foreign countries)
20% TCS on overseas credit card transactions above 7 lakhs: All you need to know
Credit card transactions in foreign currency, which were previously not considered part of the LRS, are now included within its scope. The LRS framework allows Indian residents to send money abroad up to a specific limit (currently $250,000 per financial year) for certain purposes like education expenses, travel, and investments.
Under the updated regulations, a 20% TCS is applied to these credit card transactions if the amount is more than 7 lakhs. TCS is a tax collected directly from the transaction itself instead of relying on the taxpayer to pay it later. The entity receiving the payment collects a percentage of the transaction amount as tax and submits it to the government.
Understanding the updated credit card regulation with examples
Assume you are travelling to the United States from India and using your credit card to pay for expenses exceeding 7 lakhs (except expenses like health, education). These are credit card transactions in foreign currency since you are using your credit card to make payments in US dollars rather than rupees.
The new tax will also apply to foreign currency transactions done online to foreign merchants. If you make online purchases from international websites and pay with your credit card in a foreign currency such as US dollars or euros, those transactions are classified as credit card transactions in foreign currency and will attract 20% TCS if the amount exceeds 7 lakhs.
In both circumstances, the credit card provider will convert the foreign currency amount into rupees at the time of the transaction using the current exchange rate.
The new rules under LRS aim at bringing parity between the usage of debit and credit cards in the foreign land. The move will essentially require persons undertaking transactions through international credit cards during their travels abroad to be conscious of the restrictions on transactions.

Indian wholesale prices fell in April, the first time since July 2020, indicating easing price pressures.
In more evidence that price pressures are easing in the Indian economy, wholesale prices, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), fell on an annual basis in April, the first time this is happening since July 2020. Even in sequential terms, the index has remained unchanged in the last three months. The WPI data has come days after Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell by a percentage point to reach 4.7% in April. The April CPI and WPI values are the latest the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will look at when it meets in June to decide on interest rates. Most economists expect that RBI will not increase rates anymore and might resort to cutting them sometime later in the year.

If this happens, RBI’s April move to maintain the policy rate, then described by RBI governor Shaktikanta Das as a “pause, not a pivot”, will indeed become a pivot -- and perhaps not a moment too soon. There are concerns that high interest rates could affect both investment as well as consumption spending -- although RBI will likely (and understandably) hold rates till the end of the monsoon season. It is becoming clear that growth, not inflation, will pose a bigger challenge to monetary policy this year.
Contracting by 0.9% in the month of April, WPI positively surprised analysts. A Bloomberg poll of economists projected a median contraction of 0.4%. The latest wholesale inflation is 0.42 percentage points lower than the 1.34% rise recorded in March and the lowest since June 2020 (-1.81%), indicating the easing of input prices. To be sure, recent WPI values are also the result of a favourable base effect as the index grew at double digits for 18 consecutive months from April 2021. WPI growth in April 2022 was 15.4% and reached an all-time high in the current series with a value of 16.6% in May 2022. WPI has been falling for 11 consecutive months now.
The decline in WPI inflation in April was largely driven by the contraction in manufacturing prices, while the other two subcategories of WPI – primary articles, fuel & power – slowed when compared to March. The contraction in wholesale prices of manufactured products (64% WPI share) accelerated to 2.42% in April from 0.77% in March. Growth in wholesale prices of primary articles (23% WPI share) slowed to 1.6% in April from 2.4% in March and that of fuel & power fell to 0.9% from 9%.
Also read: Number Theory: Should monetary policy pivot towards growth?
The food subcategory of WPI, which includes both primary articles and manufactured food items, saw wholesale prices growing by only 0.2% from 2.3% the previous month. Major food articles in the WPI basket also indicated a slowdown in rate of inflation in April from March. Cereal inflation cooled to 7.7% from 9.5% and milk inflation to 7.1% from 8.5%. However, there are some items in the WPI basket which show an increase in prices, although experts believe the prices of even these could ease going forward. Inflation in condiments and spices jumped to 13.8% in April from 11.6% in March. And prices of pulses in the WPI basket rose to 5.6% from 3%.
“While the decline in prices was partly due to a high base, even on a sequential basis, some easing of price pressures was evident; overall prices remained unchanged for the second month in a row, with only the food component rising sequentially owing to seasonal effects. We expect WPI inflation to continue to moderate as easing commodity prices drive input costs lower”, said Rahul Bajoria, MD & Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics, Barclays in a note.

The report predicts an $8-trillion Indian economy by 2032, but clearly states that this “will be hard work” to be achieved. What does this mean?
Some of the best commentary on the Indian economy now comes from who can euphemistically be referred to as private sector economists. They work at banks and other financial institutions and are invested in not just tracking the economy on a regular basis but also reading the tea leaves as far as its immediate, medium-term and even long-term prospects are concerned. These predictions, for investors of various kinds, are not just an academic exercise. They inform and involve billions of dollars in investment bets.

A new report predicts an eight trillion-dollar Indian economy by 2032.
One of the best private sector commentaries on the Indian economy comes from the team at HSBC research headed by Pranjul Bhandari. In a report released earlier this week, Bhandari and her colleague Aayushi Chaudhary have made predictions about what the Indian economy will look like ten years from now. Their best-case scenario envisages a 7.5% growth which will make India an eight trillion-dollar economy by 2032; third largest in the world behind the US and China. To be sure, the report clearly states that this is not a given and “it will be hard work” to achieve this goal.
A new India…
The bulk of the growth in the 7.5% growth scenario will happen in what the report calls “New India,” which includes high-tech manufacturing and tech start-ups and service providers which leverage new technologies. This “New India”, the report estimates, had a share of 15% in gross value added (GVA) and 5% in employment in 2018 and this is expected to increase to 25% and 7%, respectively, by 2032.
…And an old one
What is even more interesting is that the report does not see a significant reduction in the share of agriculture in total employment in this scenario building exercise. It is expected to come down from 42% (2018) to 36% (2032) and agriculture’s relative share in GVA – share in GVA divided by share in employment – will actually decline from 0.36 in 0.28 during this period. This means that India’s structural transformation crisis, as far as asymmetry between income and employment shares is concerned, will actually become worse.
The report gives another interesting set of statistics in terms of listing out individual contributions of various factors of production and total factor productivity (TFP) to overall growth using a Cobb Douglas production function framework. For those who are uninitiated into elementary microeconomic theory, a brief digression is in order to explain this concept.
A Cobb Douglas production function calculates TFP as a residual by deducting the role of labour and capital – the two factors of production – in overall growth. For example, let us assume a world where the only economic activity is running taxis. In a world before the internet and cab-aggregators using technology like Uber’s, business (irrespective of its distributional aspects) would be smaller with the same number of taxis, drivers and fuel spending as drivers would not know where to go looking for passengers. The gain in business with an Uber-like technology will be attributed to an increase in TFP.
To be sure, as is always the case with economists, the concept of TFP is not a universally accepted idea. Among the most basic and important critiques of the TFP approach is that it is ill-equipped to handle potential changes to growth from the demand side. To come back to our example, a lockdown which would kill demand for taxis would lead to a massive fall in business despite technology/efficiency levels remaining the same. To give a macro example, the Indian economy grows at a much higher rate when it enjoys high export demand, which it is not very difficult to understand, has got more to do with global demand than productivity/efficiency levels in the Indian economy.
Let us for a moment, set aside this theoretical critique of the concept of TFP and come back to the HSBC report. The report gives TFP values and projections from 2003-07 to 2023-32. The following chart reproduces the values given in the report and adds the share of TFP in overall GVA for each period.
The numbers, at least until 2017-19 are anything but counter-intuitive. Almost 80% of the pre-pandemic growth was driven by increase in labour and capital stock. The bulk of this would have come from expansion in India’s white collared workforce in sectors such as IT and a big increase in private investment, which, to be sure, was also responsible for the stress build-up in the banking system. By the eve of the pandemic, tailwinds to growth from both labour and capital had weakened, which once again is not very difficult to explain given the policy-induced shock to the informal economy and the twin balance sheet crisis.
However, what is interesting is the fact that the eve of the pandemic period sees a big increase in TFP’s contribution to growth with its share crossing the 30% mark. Once again, this is not very surprising given the fact that the eve of the pandemic period saw a big jump in digital innovations even as large parts of the real economy was slowing down. The report forecasts that TFP’s share in overall growth will increase to almost 37% in the 2023-32 period in the 7.5% growth scenario. The contribution of labour or human capital to growth, on the other hand, is expected to fall from 44.3% in the 2003-07 period to just 27.6% in the 2023-32 7.5% scenario.
What does this mean?
If one were to stick to the neoclassical theory framework where different factors of production get paid in keeping with their marginal product, then income share of labour can be argued to be determined only by technological factors. But if the wage rate does not rise as fast as productivity, which has otherwise been the case for India in the recent past, a sharp fall in contribution of labour to overall value-added growth also means that labour income growth — at least for the overwhelming majority — will face a sharp deceleration in the next decade. To give a more relatable argument, it makes perfect sense to argue that most of the rewards from the gains in TFP will be cornered by existing or new entrepreneurs in “New India” or their venture capitalist (VC) funders. The relative share of “New India” in GDP is expected to increase from 3 in 2018 to 3.6 by 2032 in the report.
This kind of a development in an economy already mired in very high levels of inequality is not much of a problem as far as the primary mandate of private sector economists – without any prejudice to their academic quality or integrity – in terms of facilitating better informed investment decisions is concerned. However, this has massive implications as far as the nature of India’s political economy bargaining framework is concerned.
If the majority of the people are not going to experience a significant improvement in their standard of living despite the size of the economy and per capita incomes increasing significantly in the next decade, how will it impact politics?
This column has argued on multiple occasions that India’s political economy equilibrium has become more and more dependent on the fiscal policy palliative route to legitimise politics in the face of deep rooted and increasing economic inequalities. This is a reflection of two factors, namely, the increasingly doomed agrarian transformation project and shrinking space for old-school class struggle between capital and labour.
If things are going to get only worse on these two fronts, fiscal policy will become increasingly stretched to fulfill its palliative function of generating democratic legitimacy for what will increasingly become an even more unequal economy. In fact, there is a good case to argue that fiscal policy will face a new kind of constraint as the weight of “New India” increases in the next decade. Given the fact that most start-ups in the new-tech sectors are driven by VC-funding – the HSBC report says this is critical for India’s growth prospects – and still very far from breaking even, their increasing footprint in the economy will lead to a shrinking corporation tax (levied on profits) to GDP ratio. Any attempts to raise taxes on such investments are likely to lead to a premature end to this potential economic boom by scaring such investors. Similarly, a lot of new-age manufacturing is likely to lead to a fiscal strain – thanks to subsidies under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme – rather than add to revenue collections.
So, what is to be done?
To be sure, this problem is easier stated than solved. No other economy of India’s size has ever faced such entrenched dualism where a small part of the economy is extremely dynamic but unable to generate enough traction for its lacklustre bigger half. What is also true is that India is perhaps the only economy in the Global South which will have achieved the place of world’s third largest economy without a structural suspension of democratic pulls and pressures in its political economy bargain for a significant period.
What can be said for sure is that both politics and economics will have to reinvent its established wisdom to keep the marriage between capitalism and democracy working in India.

The collapse of a few regional banks in the US, which started with Silicon Valley Bank, has sent ripples across the global banking industry.
Indian banking system is better positioned to tackle rising interest rates and the impact of the ongoing US banking turmoil on Indian lending conditions is expected to be limited, according to Crisil.

One of the most prominent lenders in the world of technology startups, Silicon Valley Bank, which was struggling, first collapsed on March 10, after a run on the bank by the depositors. Its closure led to a contagion effect and the subsequent shutting down of other banks, including Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. The collapse apparently was triggered by the consistent monetary policy tightening.

The collapse of a few regional banks in the US, which started with Silicon Valley Bank, has sent ripples across the global banking industry and posed fears of a contagion effect across economies.
Against that backdrop, Crisil, in a report, said India looks better placed to weather emerging global financial risks.

""Financial markets are watching anxiously as the effects of rate hikes by the United States (US) Federal Reserve (Fed) unravel.""
Over the past 15 months, the US Fed has hiked its policy rate by 500 basis points (bps), the fastest pace of hikes since 1980, to 5.00-5.25 per cent in its fight against above-tolerable inflation. Raising interest rates typically help in cooling demand in the economy and thus helps in managing inflation.
""The sharp rise, after a decade of record low interest rates, has already tested segments such as the tech sector, and small regional banks in the US.""
Further, on India's external funding requirements, India's dependence on such funding is expected to reduce this fiscal - 2023-24.
""India's key external liability - current account deficit (CAD) - will likely be pared this fiscal on lower crude oil prices. This, coupled with the Reserve Bank of India's adequate forex reserves and India's good growth prospects, should cushion the impact of a global spillover on overall macros,"" Crisil said.

Digital technology can significantly enable India’s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) segment, provided the emerging infrastructure has joint buy-in from the government, solution providers and importantly users. The digital landscape catering to businesses has drastically changed in recent years, several elements have emerged that can start shaping the contours of a strong digital ecosystem. The challenges reside in addressing a complex and heterogeneous MSME segment, dominated by micro enterprises at different stages, and different levels of digital readiness. The incentive for businesses to fully embrace digital technology would be to provide a digital ecosystem that provides end-to-end solutions, from finance access, payments, operations, management to even skilling and knowledge sources that are convenient.

MSMEs are a major contributor to the Indian economy, accounting for around 30% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and providing employment to over 110 million people (ministry of MSME, Annual Report 20–21). However, a more sombre story emerges when examining details. The Indian MSME sector is unique in its long fat tail of relatively unproductive micro enterprises, which are unregistered or informal, new-to-formal-credit, and characterised by low growth and employment per unit. Most of the micro enterprises are sole proprietorships with less than five employees. Furthermore, informal micro enterprises are responsible for 80% of employment while contributing only 20% of output. This highlights the composition of India’s current business landscape of tiny self-employed informal enterprises with low quality human capital. Conversely, there is a severe deficit of formal, productive, and job-creating small and medium enterprises. Furthermore, while the MSME segment is perceived as a significant job creator, the quality and conditions of the jobs created are often precarious and in the form of casual labour, daily labour and self-employment, often with very little or no job security. For most micro enterprises, the entire focus is on making sure the business stays afloat, and not on growing the business. This business stagnation hampers many crucial aspects for an enterprise to grow and achieve scale, such as efficiency, innovation and production quality. While the magnitude of these problems is well known, little progress has been made to address them efficiently given the complexity and interconnectedness. In effect, three critical ingredients needed for any early stage business to thrive, namely access to markets, skills and working capital, are sorely missing for most enterprises. On the other hand, significant public investment would be required to address these gaps and create effective market linkages, skills and mentorship, and access to finance. When considering the existing resource constraint conditions, the critical questions then become:

(1) How do we identify high growth and potential enterprises and ensure that they are prioritised?
(2) What are the critical life stages of these businesses and when do they most need support to harness their future potential?
(3) What infrastructure and tools are required to track and identify promising firms early enough in their lifecycle for them to grow?
Emerging digital data and technologies such as fintechs, e-commerce and enterprise resource planning give us a unique and unprecedented opportunity to address the questions above with reasonable efficiency and effectiveness.

“Nitin Gadkari ji, why don’t you get some VR simulator programmes made for Delhi-Mumbai Expressway,” said Anand Mahindra.
The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is poised to be a crucial infrastructure investment for India's economic growth. Automobile tycoon Anand Mahindra expressed his excitement about the progress of the expressway on Sunday, suggesting that minister Nitin Gadkari develop virtual reality (VR) simulations for the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and other picturesque highways. The Mahindra Group chairman said this would allow people to savour the experience of cruising down these scenic highways before they get the chance to actually drive on them.
Anand Mahindra suggested Nitin Gadkari to develop VR experience for highways.
""Amazing. To say that this provokes wanderlust would be an understatement. Nitin Gadkari ji, why don’t you get some VR simulator programmes made for the #DelhiMumbaiExpressway & the other scenic highways that you’re constructing?"" Mahindra commented on a Twitter post shared by Nitin Gadkari.

Netizens were amazed by Mahindra's concept. A user agreed that the wide and diverse terrain of India is a traveller's dream. He claimed that adding VR into the Delhi-Mumbai expressway and other appealing roadways would provide a one-of-a-kind experience for individuals who might not otherwise be able to travel. ""Great idea! Our highways should take place in Metaverse.""
The other, however, attempted to show a grim picture, ""...Presume there is enough scenery left in the corridor after the construction, cos in many places roads wouldn't be possible without felling of trees,"" the user commented, suggesting the government to also focus on planting trees along highways.
It is to be noted here that the government is mandated under Green Highways policy to promote greening of highway corridors.
Delhi-Mumbai Expressway
The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is connecting the national capital to the financial capital and has 40 interchanges that will improve connectivity to Jaipur, Kishangarh, Ajmer, Kota, Chittorgarh, Udaipur, Bhopal, Ujjain, Indore, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat.
Earlier this year, PM Modi inaugurated the first stretch of the expressway from Sohna to Dausa. This is said to decrease the travel time between Delhi and Jaipur to 3.5 hours.
