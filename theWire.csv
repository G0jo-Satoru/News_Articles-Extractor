"Behind GST’S Anti-Profiteering Provisions, A Legacy Of Indian Socialism",https://m.thewire.in/article/business/gsts-anti-profiteering-provisions-lndian-socialism,"Jul 04, 2017  |  Shubhang Setlur","While the government can justify various anti-profiteering measures based on socialist principles, the rules and methodology need to be clearly stated.

Nearly 70 years after B.R. Ambedkar and K.T. Shah debated over whether the Indian constitution should include the word ‘socialist’ – the former was in favour of a society being organised by the people of India, according to the time and circumstances – anti-profiteering provisions present in the country’s plan to overhaul a broken tax system remind us of this very debate.

The primary objective of the goods and services tax (GST) is to remove the cascading effect of existing taxes, that is tax on tax. The core principle of the GST is based on the fact that the tax on any input or input service utilised during the process of developing a product or a service would have to be offset against the subsequent output tax paid. The seamless credit system has been formulated keeping the consumer in mind and removes inefficiencies in the supply chain.

However, what if an entity in the supply chain, for instance, a wholesaler, decides to take benefit of a reduced tax rate courtesy the GST and not pass on such benefit to a consumer by hiking up his profit?

To counter such undue benefit, the government inserted Section 171 into the Central Goods and Services Tax Act (CGST). Section 171 of the CGST specifies that any benefit availed through extra input tax credit (as against earlier) or a reduction in rate of tax on any supply of goods or services has to be passed on to the consumer commensurately.

India Inc’s primary objection to anti-profiteering lies around the fact that it adds an additional compliance burden, and that more importantly, a reduction in rate of taxes of inputs or input services need not necessarily result in a proportionate reduction in the final price of a product or service.

While industry concerns are certainly legitimate – especially after taking into account the Modi government’s ‘minimum government, maximum governance’ motto – is there any mechanism to ensure that the consumer does become a beneficiary of GST?

Australia, Malaysia examples

Chapter XIX of the CGST, which deals with ‘Offences and Penalties’, does not provide for a mechanism to ensure a commensurate reduction in the final price of a product. Australia and Malaysia are closest international examples when it comes to understanding anti-profiteering measures. The Australian anti-profiteering measure was based on the net dollar margin rule method – that is, if taxes and costs fell by $1, then prices should also fall by at least $1. The Malaysian example is formula-based and uses a net profit margin which considers the effect of net profit on a comparative basis with a base rate net profit. For instance, the net profit margin from April 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016 (excluding GST taxes) should not exceed the net profit margin as on April 1, 2016 (base rate).

On June 20, the GST council notified the Anti Profiteering Rules, 2017 (rules). The rules currently do not contain the methodology and procedure for determining whether commensurate benefit has been passed on to consumers. However, the language used mostly mirrors the Australian model. The rules contain the bare essentials of a statute – with a three tier structure for determination of alleged anti profiteering –with the apex body being the ‘Anti-Profiteering Authority’. Penal action under the rules can even entail cancellation of GST registration.

It should be noted that a substantial chunk of the basket of items in the consumer price index have been exempted from payment of GST. Stemming from experience in other countries, the inflationary effects of GST could be high in the initial years of its implementation.

To what extent is this justified? On the face of it, the government can certainly rely on the concept of a welfare state based on socialist principles to justify various anti-profiteering measures. The Supreme Court has also time and again upheld the concept of securing and protecting a social order which comprises of economic justice as well. When examined from the pointed perspectives of a consumer and from a tangible benefit to the economy, the anti-profiteering authority may well be justified.

Industry issues are focused around feasibility of the measures and its implementation, and potential harassment at the hands of the taxman. What could have been done perhaps is have the Competition Commission, which examines pricing in detail, study how the passing of commensurate benefit could be ensured.

However, from a legislative standpoint, the argument against anti-profiteering rewinds back to the debate on socialism, and importantly on an ideal which India arguably believes in as a legacy. Importantly, the rules have been worded from the perspective of a need-based manner, which mostly would be required in the case of oligopolistic markets. Given the vogue nature of the GST and the risk and accountability that the government has towards the second largest consumer base in the world, the government cannot be entirely blamed for introducing an anti-profiteering measure.

Taxation statutes are most susceptible to the slightest change in an economic environment – a close case in point being the negative list of services in service tax wherein the government, in a single stroke, changed 18 years of grappling with an arduous memory recall exercise of adding services on a year-on-year basis to a catch-all means to cover all taxation services.

As a parting thought, had the wording of the statute been “Input Tax Credit-Commensurate Benefit Rules”, would industry reaction have been different?

India’s Forex Reserves See Biggest Weekly Loss In Seven Years,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/indias-forex-reserves-see-biggest-weekly-loss-in-seven-years,"Oct 21, 2018  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India’s foreign exchange reserves saw their biggest weekly loss since November 2011, as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened heavily in the currency market to shore up an embattled rupee.

The domestic currency is under pressure due to concern over the government’s ability to finance its current account deficit (CAD) in the face of high global oil prices.

Forex reserves dropped by $5.14 billion in the seven days ended October 12, show data released by the RBI on Friday.The forex reserves stood at $394.46 billion as on October 12, down 7.5% from the peak of $426.08 billion as on April 13.

Rising oil prices have fueled worry about the Modi government’s ability to finance CAD, leading to flight of foreign capital. That has hit market sentiments about the rupee.

The rupee has fared worst among all Asian currencies, falling more than 14% against the US dollar during this year, forcing the RBI to sell dollars in the market to support the beleaguered domestic currency. After breaching 74 against the greenback, the rupee has regained some lost ground. It closed at 73.32 against the dollar on Friday.

This data “clearly indicates significant intervention from the central bank and they now seem to be drawing a line in the sand,” Mint quoted Anindya Banerjee, a foreign-exchange analyst at Kotak Securities in Mumbai, as saying.

It shows the central bank doesn’t want to see the rupee go beyond 74 to the dollar, Banerjee added.

Foreign funds took out about $13 billion from local bonds and stocks so far this year."
"China, India and the World After Trump",https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/china-india-and-the-world-after-trump,"Nov 24, 2016  |  Shyam Saran","In the next decade, how US-China relations unfold will shape the external environment for countries like India. Much will depend on how China perceives the Trump presidency.

We are today at a true inflexion point in international affairs. Europe is disoriented and in disarray thanks to Brexit. The US under president-elect Donald Trump is likely to see significant discontinuities from the past. Just recently, he has announced that after his inauguration, he will give notice for the US’s withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), that he will permit the resumption of coal mining and coal-based thermal power plants, and that he will ask the department of labour to begin registering illegal migrants who will be deported. He has, therefore, left no one in doubt that he intends to deliver on at least some of his campaign promises. So we will see departures from past US policies and there will be resultant uncertainty.

By contrast, China appears as relatively stable, predictable and even positive factor as the international landscape continues to be transformed. At the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima, the US and China seemed to have undergone a role reversal, with the US under Trump expected to head in the direction of greater protectionism, while President Xi Jinping promised an even more open China, championed free trade and pushed for a APEC-wide mega-regional trade regime. With the US-led TPP already in limbo, China’s initiative for a more inclusive Asia-Pacific Free Trade Agreement has begun to look positively enticing, even to the major trade partners of the US.

In the next decade, how US-China relations unfold will shape the external environment for countries like India. Much will depend on how China perceives the Trump presidency.

I believe that China looks upon the Trump presidency as an opportunity to further expand China’s regional and international profile. There may be anxiety over Trump’s threats to impose punitive tariffs on imports from China and to declare China a “currency manipulator”. However, China believes that the more than half a trillion dollars of US-China bilateral trade, significant investments by US firms in China and Chinese holdings of a large volume of US treasury securities represent equities which will restrain a Trump administration from damaging the US-China economic relationship, because the damage to US interests will also be large. So the Chinese believe that the threat on the economic and trade front may be limited. On the other hand, they welcome a possible retrenchment of US military presence in the Asia-Pacific, which Trump has signaled, with the loosening of US security ties with both allies and partners in the region. Since China believes that its dominant position in the region is constrained mainly by US power, a relative decline of that power would be welcome to China. It would, however, expect a graduated and steady decline so as not to trigger a possible acquisition of nuclear weapons by Japan and perhaps South Korea as well, which would impact Chinese security negatively. If trends are indeed in this direction, I expect pressures on Southeast Asia to increase and more activism on the Taiwan issue is likely.

The Russia question

Against this background, a US-Russia détente would be welcome from an Indian perspective. To the extent that Europe was following an American lead in trying to isolate and sanction Russia, a Trump outreach to Putin may revive the many political and economic links that had developed between post-Cold War Russia and European partners, in particular Germany. Russia has always wanted to be accepted as a European power, rather than be treated as an interloper on its margins. If this is once again on the horizon, Russia’s traditional anxieties about a resurgent China may well resurface. This may introduce a degree of balance in what may otherwise appear as the beginning of a Chinese decade.

Some analysts believe that economic imbalances in China are reaching a point where a crisis is possible; an economic slowdown is inevitable. Nevertheless, the Chinese economy has now achieved a degree of maturity and diversity; the management of the economy is remarkably sophisticated and the capacity for creative innovation and technological progress is evident. Even if the Chinese economy suffers a setback, it has accumulated the human and technological resources and the infrastructure to enable it to bounce back. I do not agree that China’s capacity for such creativity demands political democracy. Joseph Needham’s work would lead us to a different conclusion.

Chinese politics is likely to trend towards authoritarianism. In Chinese perception, internal peace and prosperity have flourished in times of strong centralised and indeed, expanding empire. In its absence there has been misery and chaos. This is hard-wired into the Chinese psyche. I do not foresee China following an East Asian model of economic prosperity leading to some recognisable form of representative democracy. Chinese politics is brittle and there have been major disruptions in the past, but I believe this is now less likely.

New role for India?

So what does this mean for India in the next decade? The management of India-China relations has become more complex, more challenging than at any time in the history of independent India. There will need to be a fine distinction between treating China an adversary, which it obviously is and will remain for the foreseeable future, and casting it in the role of an enemy. In acknowledging its role as an adversary, one will inevitably have to fashion a nuanced mix of engagement and resistance, and this mix will change as India’s own co-relation with China changes and the regional and global environment continues to evolve. In the decade ahead, I envisage the power gap between India and China in terms of both economic and military capabilities remaining large and even expanding. China’s economy, after all, is already five times that of India. This would suggest a policy of prudence, not provocation; caution and avoidance of bravado. On the contested border, we need to deploy both air and ground capabilities, which could render any Chinese military probing or something more significant a risky affair with unpredictable outcomes for the Chinese.

There should be no hesitation in continuing to strengthen security arrangements with the US, which even with its power in relative decline, would remain the indispensable global power with unmatched technological and military capabilities. The changed environment in the region will create opportunities for India, even as it does for China. Japan, Southeast Asia and Australia would welcome an expanded Indian footprint in the region and there may be greater willingness to seek expanded security, maritime cooperation with India in particular. These relationships need to be pursued with greater vigour and we should not be inhibited by anxieties over Chinese adverse reaction. Chinese restraint is more likely if India has a stronger network of political, economic and security relationships with major powers and other partners in the region, rather than if such a network was weakened by the fear of China. A relatively isolated India is likely to be more vulnerable to Chinese pressure than otherwise.

And the engagement aspect remains critically important, even though there may be points of enhanced contestation such as stronger Chinese alliance with Pakistan, its opposition to India’s NSG membership and other similar issues. India’s membership of G-20, SCO, BRICS and the India-China-Russia trilateral are very useful platforms for engaging China and providing opportunities for regular meetings at the top leadership level. These summits are important. Our experience over the past decade has been that such summit meetings have lent a degree of stability to the relationship and enabled both countries to manage a complex and sometimes fractious relationship. In the decade to come, such leadership engagement will become even more important.

"India's GST, Hyped as Another Tryst With Destiny, Remains a Half-Way House of Disruptions",https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/indias-gst-hyped-another-tryst-destiny-remains-half-way-house-disruptions,"Dec 30, 2017  |  Noor Mohammad","If anything, GST has proved a nightmare for businesses in the short-term, especially for those in the informal sector.

As we bid farewell to 2017, The Wire looks back at some of the markers of disruption that affected different spheres, from politics and economics to technology and films.

The central hall of parliament was the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s choice of venue for the launch of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. A midnight session on June 30, 2017, in what could only be construed as a throwback to the historic ‘tryst with destiny speech’ delivered by India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru to the Constituent Assembly on August 14, 1947.

However, as The Wire had indicated at the time, the GST has failed to live up to the hype. If anything, it has proved a nightmare for businesses in the short-term, especially for those in the informal sector. In the run-up to the launch, the Modi government roped in film star Amitabh Bachchan, often tapped to help spread awareness about the Centre’s programmes, to star in a host of videos that all promised “one nation, one tax and one market”.

Unfortunately, much like GST itself, this is true only in word and not in spirit. While there are a number of procedural and technical reasons that have proven responsible in making GST troublesome for India’s informal economy, the single most overarching problem is that the Indian GST is much more complicated than what other countries have implemented. It has as many as six tax rates unlike other countries where a single rate prevails.

Moreover, both the Centre and states have the power to collect tax in India unlike other countries where this authority is vested in a single agency.

This is primarily why India’s GST also remains just a half-way house, with major items of consumption for industry like petrol and diesel, natural gas and electricity still outside its ambit. That means companies which these products as raw materials cannot avail input tax credit.

In the weeks and months after it was rolled out, the tax reform led to disrupted supply chains and hit exports hard as small businesses found it too complicated to comply with. Exporters saw their working capital requirement shoot up in the wake of GST roll-out on July 1 due to accumulation of unpaid input tax credits and reduction in duty drawback rates on their products.

Following India’s switch to GST, exports have witnessed an uneven monthly growth trend. Merchandise exports showed a negative growth of 1.12% in October. Exports from labour intensive sectors like gems and jewellery, apparels and leather and leather products reported precipitous drops during the month, raising a spectre of massive job losses.

Ironically, this came at a time when the global trade was in a boom phase. As per the latest forecast by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), global trade is likely to grow by 3.6% in 2017, up from the lacklustre 1.3% growth in 2016. While India’s exports have rebounded in November, encouraging some economists to express optimism that the industry might have shrugged off negative impact of GST, the picture is far from clear. A sustained trend of growth in exports is yet to be seen.

Intensive help

In the last few months, as state elections grew closer, the Modi government simplified compliance procedures and rules to provide relief to the industry. However, there is no end in sight to the woes of the country’s exporters.

Ajay Sahai, director general and CEO, Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), told The Wire, “The refund process has slightly improved as compared to October but still thousands of exporters are waiting for their July refund. Even customs and tax authorities are unable to tell the reasons for delay. For ITC, refund has been symbolic.” Sahai added, “The declarations are redundant; the refund is based on nexus, not on the formula prescribed and documents are not clearly listed. These have compounded exporters’ problems.”

Anil Bhardwaj, secretary general, Federation of Micro and Small and Medium Enterprises (FISME), too has flagged similar concerns. “While in the beginning MSMEs struggled with registration and filings, now the challenges they face remain in invoice matching, claiming refunds and making corrections. Absence of real-time support during filing or payments means if you make mistake, you are stuck,” Bhardwaj told The Wire.

“While a lot has improved, the GST framework is a still a long way to offer ease of working with GST,” he added.

Critics maintain that the GST was rolled out in haste. They cite its frequent tinkering by the GST council to buttress their argument. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which form the backbone of the country’s manufacturing sector, were hit hard. Garment exporters say their export competitiveness has fallen due to the increase in working capital requirement and reduction in incentives. As per industry estimates, Indian garment exports have become 8-10% costlier after GST roll-out, which is hurting exporters’ margins as well as sales volumes.

Alarmed over the sharp decline in October exports, the government has offered more incentives to help stem the bleeding for besieged garment exporters. Post-GST rates for claiming rebate of state taxes under the scheme for remission of state levies (RoSL) on exports of readymade garments and made-ups have been announced. The government has also doubled the rates for incentives under merchandise export from India (MEIS) scheme to 4%.

New MEIS rates are effective from November 1.

Post-GST rates of RoSL are up to a maximum of 1.70% for cotton garments, 1.25% for man-made fibre, silk and woollen garments and 1.48% for apparel of blends.

As part of the mid-term trade review policy for 2015-2020 early this month, the government has announced fresh export incentives to labour-intensive sectors and services, which would cost the exchequer Rs 8,450 crore annually. Meanwhile, the commerce ministry is working on a relief package for gems and jewellery exporters. The ministry has already asked the gems and jewellery industry to work out a proper business plan to promote growth of the sector.

“We have some time left, in another few weeks we have to finalise it as Budget will be in February, so we have to work on that (relief package for gems and jewellery exporters),” commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu said recently. The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council has demanded that import duty on gold should be slashed to 4% from the current 10% level.

The trade body is mindful of the government’s concern that a lower import duty could lead to a spurt in gold imports but hopes that a cut would be finally made as a trade-off. Another MSME-dominated sector, leather industry, estimates that it would need additional capital of over Rs 3,000 crore following implementation of the GST. There is a fear in the industry that many units could close down due to failure to raise capital.

The Council for Leather Exports, an industry body, has demanded that Centre’s duty drawback scheme for leather exporters should be extended till March 2018 as exporters’ capital was blocked on account of GST payment.

The industry body also wants the GST on finished leather goods and job work reduced to 5% from the current level of 12% and 18% respectively.

Softening the blow

In successive meetings, the GST council has approved comprehensive changes to smoothen the hard edges off the new tax regime. To this end, it has significantly reduced number of products under the highest rate of 28%. The council also relaxed return filing rules for MSMEs, deferred the controversial reverse charge mechanism until the next fiscal and hastened tax refunds for exporters hit by cash crunch.

The GST council on October 6 slashed rates on 27 items and 12 services, and introduced sweeping changes in GST rules to calm panic among small enterprises and exporters who were struggling with procedural tangles, refunds and technical glitches while filing returns on GSTN portal.

Specifically, the annual turnover threshold on the composition scheme has been raised from Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore.

Under the scheme, traders, manufacturers and restaurants can pay tax at 1, 2 and 5%, respectively. The turnover threshold has been increased by the government to ease the compliance burden for taxpayers as they will have to file returns on a quarterly basis, not every month as required for normal taxpayers.

However, unlike normal tax payers, dealers cannot avail input tax credit. About 15.5 lakh assessees with a turnover of less than Rs 1 crore have opted for the composition scheme, as per official data. Again in its meeting on November 10, the council pruned the list of product categories under 28% slab to 50 from 178 earlier.

These rapid changes have not been without consequences. Indirect tax collections this fiscal are feared to dip below the Centre’s target due to disruption caused by GST, which has in turn cast doubt over the government’s ability to meet the fiscal deficit target of 3.2%.

The Centre plans on collecting Rs 9.68 lakh crore from indirect taxes in the current fiscal while a mop-up of Rs 9.8 lakh crore has been targeted from direct taxes. Direct tax collections increased by 14.4% to Rs 4.8 lakh crore during April-November this fiscal. However, GST collection (indirect taxes) in October at Rs 83,346 crore was Rs 12,000 crore less compared to the preceding month and the lowest since the July 1 roll-out.

According to government sources, uncertainty prevails over whether tax realisation would be as per budget estimates in the remaining months of the fiscal. The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) has also privately warned the Centre that indirect tax collections could fall short of target due to disruption caused by the GST.

N.R. Bhanumurthy, Professor, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) told The Wire that the Centre’s tax collection target might not be realised due to uncertainty relating to GST. He, however, added that it was too early to say whether the government would be able to meet the fiscal deficit target or not.

With long-awaited revival of private investment nowhere in sight, the government is banking on increased public spending to support the economic recovery. GDP growth inched back to 6.3% in the second quarter after slumping to 5.7% in April-June period. If the government tightens its purse strings now, the economic recovery could derail, hitting jobs.

Job creation prospects are already dim, with labour intensive sectors like agriculture, construction and continuing to remain in the doldrums.

Agriculture GDP growth slowed to 1.7% in the second quarter from 2.3% in April-June period. The construction sector grew by 2.6% in the July-September quarter, slightly up from 2% in the preceding quarter.

Road ahead

The Centre is keen to bring remaining items like alcohol, petrol and diesel, natural gas, electricity and real estate under GST. However, doing so would be challenging for it given that states’ nod is needed for making any change in the GST. These items contribute a significant chunk of states’ tax revenues and so they are likely to resist any move to include them in GST.

The Centre too is mindful of the difficulty. For example, finance minister Arun Jaitley has said that the Centre supports the inclusion of petroleum products within GST’ ambit, but it can happen only if states come on board.

“As far as the Central government is concerned, we are in favour of bringing petroleum products under the GST, let me categorically put it. But we will wait for the consensus of the states. And, I do hope that at some stage – sooner than later – the states would agree to it,” Jaitley recently told the Rajya Sabha in reply to a question."
Indian Army's Yeti Claim Was Bad Data That Only Worsens Our Biodiversity Crisis,https://m.thewire.in/article/environment/indian-armys-yeti-claim-was-bad-data-that-only-worsens-our-biodiversity-crisis,"May 04, 2019  |  Dhruv Gangadharan Arvind","The crux of the problem is that if we don’t know what is out there or how widely species are distributed, how can we convince people about the reality and form of the biodiversity crisis? – Conservation Biogeography, 2011

The Indian Army’s announcement of “Mysterious Footprints of mythical beast ‘Yeti'” with photographic ‘evidence’ of footprints on Twitter doesn’t just appear as a farce to sceptics. With respect to our understanding of animals, it reveals how the “discovery” of such a cryptic species is communicated. It is also an example of how such misinformation has wider implications for biodiversity conservation.

With approximately 8.7 million species, our planet harbours a staggering diversity of life in its ecosystems. Conservationists, taxonomists and geographers systematically catalogue and map this biodiversity to find patterns and understand variations to develop conservation models.

A pioneering study in 2011 showed that of the 8.7 million species, only 1.2 million have been formally identified and catalogued, while 86% of biodiversity still awaits description. Despite the use of sophisticated tools and technology, this statistic shows how little we actually know about the diversity of life, especially at a time when up to a million species are at risk of extinction due to human influences.

As the global conservation movement becomes a data-driven effort, such gaps in our knowledge of biodiversity hinder conservation. They can mainly be attributed to unreliable or incomplete data together with a lack of robust methods of enquiry that end up producing uncertain information on the presence of species in an area.

Erroneous primary information

The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) popularised the concept of binomial nomenclature, which has been used to identify and catalogue species. Modern species inventories like the Encyclopaedia of Life, which provide access to species information and knowledge on biodiversity, have their origins in Linnaeus’s book Systema Naturae (1735). Regarding the 86% – the discrepancy between the actual number of species and the number of species described by scientists constitutes a Linnaean shortfall.

Yeti sightings can be understood in this context. As a creature of myth sustained through folklore in the Himalayan-Tibetan region, the ‘abominable snowman’ has fascinated many. Much to public dismay, an article on The Wire communicated the findings of a study published in 2017 that ascribed the identity of yetis to the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus), the Tibetan brown bear (Ursus arctos pruinosus) and the Himalayan black bear (Ursus thibetanus laniger).

This means yeti sightings were actually bear sightings. The myth was busted – but the conflict doesn’t appear to be resolved. This is because of the way doubts vis-à-vis ecological data have been allowed to persist.

While it is clear that yetis can’t be defined as a separate species, the three bears are biologically distinct. If one were to assimilate all yeti sightings ever recorded, which of the three bear (sub)species could the yeti be attributed to? This isn’t a superfluous problem that concerns only bear enthusiasts. The example shows how erroneous primary information such as yeti sightings can negatively affect our efforts to extract information specific to the three bears pertinent.

Addressing threats of endangerment, the IUCN Red List lists “awareness and communication” as conservation actions and calls for research on the bears’ “population size, distribution and trends”. This obviously doesn’t include bizarre operations conducted by the country’s armed forces to find an “elusive snowman”, setting irresponsible standards in scientific communication.

Keep the garbage out

A map from the 2017 bear study shows researchers had collected samples of a Tibetan brown bear from Makalu Barun, Nepal, and the army had located the supposed yeti footprints at the Makalu Base Camp. This reveals another problem: the veracity of primary data used in models to determine how species are geographically distributed and mapped.

If the use of pugmarks is an established method to locate species like tigers, why can’t the yeti’s footprints be used to indicate its presence? Should maps now show the occurrence of a yeti in a region populated by brown bears?

If the army personnel had properly examined these footprints and catalogued them, they would have served as valuable information to map the distribution of bears in the region, and would have counted as vital research in the IUCN’s book.

Experts have acknowledged that insufficient information on the geographical distribution of species can blow large holes in our conservation knowledge. This amounts to a Wallacean shortfall, named after British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913): an inadequacy of information on the geographic distribution of species.

The yeti case isn’t isolated. The North American bigfoot or sasquatch is a similarly misidentified cryptic species that has been reported in places populated by the American black bear (Ursus americanus). A study published in 2009 showed how similar the sasquatch’s and bear’s distributions seemed to be, although it didn’t attempt – thankfully – to check if the sasquatch really existed. It concluded that conservation models are only as good as the data they are built with. In other words, errors introduced in the process of publicly sourcing data could result in serious inaccuracies that impact actual conservation action.

Citizen science has allowed researchers to crowdsource conservation information, including sightings. For example, a database called iNaturalist allows people to record their observations at specific locations by uploading photographs, helping collect valuable information for the conservation community. And iNaturalist doesn’t return searches for ‘yeti’ and ‘sasquatch’.

It is pragmatic to filter wrong information out rather than discourage citizens from contributing data on biodiversity, but the army has set a substandard precedent. It was unbecoming for a national institution to communicate its findings in the manner it did because the data was essentially “bad” data. The encounter could instead have been used to communicate the presence of endangered bear species in the region to capture public imagination on conservation.

"SCO Is New but Indian, Pak Troops Are Old Partners in Multilateral Missions",https://m.thewire.in/article/security/india-pakistan-troops-sco-multilateral-missions,"Apr 30, 2018  |  Devirupa Mitra","New Delhi: While India and Pakistan will participate in a multilateral counter-terrorist military exercise in Russia later this year as part of their obligations as members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, soldiers from both countries have cooperated and worked together in third countries for over 60 years.

At the recent SCO meeting in China, Indian defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman confirmed that India will participate in the ‘Peace Mission’ military exercise to be held in the Ural mountains this September. A slew of breathless media reports followed, claiming this would be the “first time” troops from India and Pakistan – South Asia’s biggest rivals – would be taking part in an international military exercise.

While Sitharaman confirmed India’s presence at the exercise, it wasn’t a surprise. All SCO members take part together in counter-terrorist military exercises – a fact that was widely reported when India and Pakistan became full members of the grouping last year.

In fact, India and Pakistan have technically already been involved in a common multilateral military exercise. The annual Cobra Gold drill has seven full participating members, but India and Pakistan have been sending regular delegations as observers in the last few couple of years.

While the SCO’s military exercise will last only a few days, Indian and Pakistani soldiers have been working side by side in difficult and remote areas of the world in peacekeeping operations under the United Nations, where they are often deployed for months and years in risky and dangerous ‘real world’ situations..

A review of the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations’s database shows that India and Pakistan have at least 28 missions, past and present, in common between them. In total, over 55 UN missions have been completed since the first peacekeeping mission during the Suez crisis.

It is actually not much of a surprise that soldiers from the two South Asian nations have found themselves together over the years, since both India and Pakistan have consistently been among the top five troop contributors to UN missions.

Among the 14 current missions, India and Pakistan are working in conjunction in the UN organisation stabilization mission in DRC (MONUSCO), where they have presently deployed 2327 and 3429 soldiers, respectively. Both countries have paid a heavy toll during this mission, with a combined loss of 25 military personnel.

In fact, Congo has been the joint operational ground for Indian and Pakistani troops from the beginning. The earliest that the two countries were in the same UN mission was also in Congo for the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) from 1960 to 1964. At the peak of the mission, there were 19,828 troops in the Congo, who were supervising the withdrawal of Belgian forces and preventing civil war. There were soldiers from 30 countries, including India and Pakistan. Indian diplomat Rajeshwar Dayal had been the head of the mission for nine months.

In yet another peacekeeping mission in Congo about half a century later, two future army chiefs of India and Pakistan worked together to implement the 1999 Lusaka ceasefire agreement.

Pakistani army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa was one of the bridge commanders in 2007-8 who was reporting to Bikram Singh, who was the Indian army chief from 2012 to 2014. In an article in India Today, Singh narrated how he and Bajwa worked in sync over complex operational matters.

During the sixties, Indian army officer P.S. Gyani had been one of the force commanders of the 15-month long UN Yemen Observation Mission, which included military personnel from India and Pakistan who observed the execution of the disengagement agreement between Saudi Arabia and the then United Arab Republic.

More recently, Lt Gen Satish Nambiar was the first force commander of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in 1992-93, which was mandated to create the conditions for an eventual settlement of the Yugoslav civil war. India did not send troops for UNPROFOR, but Nambiar had over 3000 Pakistani soldiers under his supervision.

Around that time, the UN Observer mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) was established to ensure compliance of the ceasefire agreement between the Georgian government and the Abkhaz authorities. Three Pakistani military officers were chief military observers during its 16-year-long period. India had been among the 34 countries that sent troops to the central Asian country.

Pakistani diplomat Iqbal Riza had been head of two important UN missions – in Bosnia and Herzegovina and El Salvaldor – where Indian soldiers played an important role."
India Needs a Court of Appeal to Maintain the Supreme Court's Status,https://m.thewire.in/article/government/why-india-needs-a-court-of-appeal-to-maintain-the-supreme-courts-status,"Mar 07, 2016  |  Vishavjeet Chaudhary","A National Court of Appeal will help clear the backlog of cases and maintain the Supreme Court’s position as the apex court of the land.

The Supreme Court of India, as the highest court of the land, has a sacrosanct function to ensure that the country is governed adhering to the principles of the rule of law. It has evolved remarkably well, steering the country through thick and thin. It also has had a tremendous contribution to the jurisprudential landscape, not just in the country but also internationally. The time has come, however, to revisit the court’s function and align it with the needs of today.

A different time

Since the Supreme Court was established in 1950, the nation’s demands have changed tremendously. The population of India in 1950 was less than 36 crores. At present, it is over 1.2 billion. The questions that came before the courts back then were also of a comparatively rudimentary nature – as can be expected of a newly-conceived nation. There were, of course, important constitutional matters that the Court had to adjudicate on. However, areas of law like intellectual property, and taxation and corporate law were not as big as they are today. Thus, with a limited population and limited areas of law, the Court could cope with just the chief justice and seven judges. Working hours and days were also limited to four hours a day, 28 days a year.

Over the decades, with the growth in population and an increasing number of cases going for appeal, the current number of judges at the Supreme Court increased and now stands at 25 (with the maximum allowed being 31). The Court also functions for most of the year now. Even with the increase in the number of judges and working hours, there is a massive backlog of cases. In 2015, the previous chief justice of India, Justice H L Dattu, estimated the number of pending cases in the country at three crores. A majority of these cases were in the lower courts but there was also a substantial number of cases pending before the Supreme Court.

Perhaps looking at it from an external viewpoint will be a wake up call. A victim who was injured in the terror attacks in the Taj Hotel wanted the trial for compensation to take place in London rather than in India. In 2013, a London court ruled that the case could be fought in London courts, on the grounds that holding the trial in India could take “some twenty years.”

Why national courts of appeal are a good idea

Getting justice in India takes years, sometimes even decades. The Supreme Court cannot to be blamed for this. Delivering justice does take time – in order to ensure fairness, all parties should be satisfied that they have had reasonable time to prepare their cases, present witnesses and so on.

However, there is a solution that can at least unclog the Supreme Court so that cases that matter the most and have an impact on the country as a whole can be wrapped up with reasonable efficiency.

On February 26 the Supreme Court issued a notice to the central government to establish a national court of appeal with benches in Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai. This seems to be a step in the right direction for numerous reasons.

First, the Supreme Court will maintain its place as the apex court of land and – like England, Wales and the US – only rule on matters that are of constitutional importance or set new legal precedent. This will allow the Court to dedicate more time to develop the law. The Supreme Court of the UK, for instance, consists of 12 judges and in 2013-2014 only heard about 80 cases. For most cases, the final court of appeal is the aptly named Court of Appeal. Similarly, in India, if a court of appeal is established, the majority of appeals from high courts can be addressed in these courts.

Second, it will make geographical sense to have different benches to hear appeals. As of now, all appeals have to be heard in New Delhi, inconvenient for cases originating in other parts of the country.

Third, a court of appeal can work as an excellent mechanism to sieve cases. If there are areas of law that are particularly unsettled and need clarification, the court of appeal can club them together and send these forward to the Supreme Court. Not only can a number of individual cases be disposed of but areas of law can also be settled and a clear precedent set.

Finally, if the Supreme Court only deals with crucial cases, the process will become streamlined and will save a lot of time and expense, for both litigants and the courts.

There are practical obstacles, of course. For instance, how do we appoint judges to the court of appeal? How do we modify the procedure? Many such issues would have to be worked out. Without doubt, however, it is time to seriously consider a new court of appeal to unclog the Supreme Court and to ensure that its position as the apex court is preserved.

Coronavirus Outbreak in India: Six Suspected Cases Admitted to RML Hospital,https://m.thewire.in/article/health/coronavirus-outbreak-in-india-six-suspected-cases-admitted-to-rml-hospital,"Jan 31, 2020  |  PTI","New Delhi: Six persons, suspected of being affected by the novel coronavirus, have been kept under observation at an isolation ward of Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital here and their test reports are awaited, hospital sources said on Friday.

India reported its first case of novel coronavirus in Kerala on Thursday and the patient has been kept in an isolation ward in the state, the Union health ministry said.

Five persons self-reported to the RML hospital, designated to deal with such cases, with respiratory problems and fever, hospital sources said.

Among the five, a female (24) has been staying in China since 2015 and had returned to India on January 29.

Apart from the female patient, four men, one aged 45-years, returned to India on January 23 while another (35) has been staying in China for the last seven years and returned to India on January 28.

Another male (19) was in China from November 2019 to January 24, 2020, and returned to India on January 25. Another male (34) who was staying in China for the last 10 years, returned to India on January 16.

While the above five had self-admitted themselves on January 30, the remaining one is an old admission — a male (32), who visited China from January 4 to January 11, officials said.

“The samples of all the six patients have been sent for testing and their reports are awaited,” an RML official said.

The government has stepped up its efforts to detect and prevent the spread of the virus that has killed at least 170 people and infected more than 7,700 in China and has spread to at least 17 countries already.

Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba on Thursday reviewed the country’s preparedness with the concerned ministries – health and family welfare, external affairs, defence, home affairs, civil aviation, information and broadcasting, labour and employment, and shipping – to tackle the spread of the virus, an official release said.

He also spoke to chief secretaries of the states and UTs through video-conference, it added.

During these meetings, it was decided that all those who have come from China after 15 January will be tested for the exposure to the virus and also the lab facilities will be augmented.

While six labs will start functioning from Thursday, including one at AIIMS in Delhi, six more labs will start function by Friday, the release said.

Apart from putting measures in place to battle the spread at home, the government is also getting ready to evacuate its nationals on Friday from China, which continued to scramble to contain the spread of the deadly virus.

Authorities have been screening patients at 21 airports, ports and borders for possible coronavirus infection and the health ministry has urged people to report themselves if they show symptoms of the virus, such as cold and respiratory distress, on the 24×7 helpline (011-23978046).

The ministry has asked people to refrain from travelling to China and the states bordering Nepal – Uttarakhand, UP, Bihar, West Bengal and Sikkim – have stepped up vigil."
"India Holds ""Substantive"" Talks with China Over NSG Bid",https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/india-holds-substantive-talks-with-china-over-nsg-bid,"Sep 14, 2016  |  Reuters","New Delhi: India on Tuesday said it had held “substantive“ talks with China on its bid to become a fully fledged member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a club of nations that trades in civil nuclear technology.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is campaigning to join the NSG to back a multi-billion-dollar drive to build nuclear power plants in partnership with Russia, the US and France and reduce India‘s reliance on polluting fossil fuels.

Yet his bid to win accession to the 48-member group, founded in response to India‘s first atomic weapons test in 1974, has so far failed to win over strategic rival China, which enjoys a de facto veto because the group operates by consensus.

India‘s foreign ministry said in a statement that its chief nuclear negotiator, Amandeep Singh Gill, had hosted a Chinese delegation led by Director General Wang Qun of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The talks, agreed earlier by the two countries’ foreign ministers, covered issues of mutual interest in the areas of disarmament and non-proliferation and focused on India‘s bid to join the NSG.

“The discussions were candid, pragmatic and substantive,” the foreign ministry said, adding that further talks would be held.

China‘s foreign ministry, in its statement on the talks, said the issue of countries which are not signatories to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty joining the NSG was a “new issue” for the group.

China is willing to hold talks on the issue, but does not yet have a position on the joining of the group by any specific country that has not signed the treaty, the ministry added.

The treaty recognises the five permanent members of the UN Security Council – the US, Russia, China, Britain and France – as nuclear weapons powers but not others.

India has ruled out signing the NPT but says its track record of non-proliferation should entitle it to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group. India was granted an NSG waiver in 2008 that allows it to engage in nuclear commerce, but deprives it of a vote in the organisation’s decision making.

Backers of India‘s NSG bid, which include the US, hope a deal can still be reached despite a setback at the group’s annual meeting in Seoul in June.

Modi will host Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit of the BRICS emerging markets caucus in the Indian resort state of Goa in mid-October."
India’s NSG Dream Is Becoming a Distant Mirage,https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/indias-nsg-dream-is-becoming-a-distant-mirage,"Nov 30, 2016  |  The Wire Staff","However, the Wassenaar Arrangement may soon be ready to welcome India into its fold, officials indicated.

New Delhi: India’s initial optimism on being able enter the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) soon has withered away, with the last consultative group meeting in Vienna not making much progress, in New Delhi’s perception.

At the consultative group meeting in Vienna on November 12, Argentina’s ambassador to Austria Rafael Mariano Grossi presented the preliminary findings of his consultations with members of the NSG to find an acceptable solution to India’s application.

In Seoul, Grossi, the outgoing NSG chair, was made the facilitator to find a way out of the stalemate in which China and several other nations wanted to draw up special entry ‘criteria’ for applicants who are not a part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. For Beijing, the insistence of helped to not just to stall India’s membership, but to also put Pakistan’s application in the same bracket.

India was, obviously, not part of the deliberations in Vienna. But the proceedings have not brought good cheer.

According to sources, Grossi’s presentation had a “lot of resonance” among the officials present at the meeting, with some members asking for further clarifications.

There was no official statement after the meeting. China, once again, was the exception. Chinese officials have been proactively releasing statements since India expressed interest in joining the NSG. Three days after the Vienna meeting, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson described the Vienna meeting as a “good start of the inter-governmental process to implement the two-step proposal”. With the new incoming US administration, there is more concern on whether President-elect Donald Trump will have any leverage to work with Beijing to convince it to modify its views, just as George Bush had mustered all of US’s diplomatic muscle to get India an NSG waiver in 2008.

Indian officials have been careful not to use the Chinese phrase of ‘two-step’ proposal and thereby give it currency. But there is increasing acceptance within the group for a “non-discriminatory” process, which will draw up the qualifications for membership before the applications are considered.

A week before the meeting, Grossi’s remarks at a conference in Brussels were revealing about the consultations moving towards a criteria-based approach.

“What I can say, and this has to do maybe with other comments, is that what we are looking for is something which is of general application. We are not working on the basis of Country A or Country B or Country C. We are working on something that, if successful, it is a big if because it is a big issue and the problems are big. If successful, this is not something which is going to be for the benefit of Country A or for the benefit of Country B or for the benefit of Country C. It is, if I may put it like this, an attempt to address the challenge or the question put to the group by the existence of three non-NPT countries which actively aspire to become members of the NSG. This is as much as I think I could say. “

As The Wire reported before the consultative group meeting, Austria was one of the few countries which remained steadfast on the need for the NPT to be the cornerstone of qualifications for new NSG members.

On Monday, an Austrian foreign ministry delegation held formal talks with Ministry of Eexternal Affairs secretary (west) Sujata Mehta in Delhi, where the NSG matter was raised by India. There was no change in its position, with Austrian officials only willing to say that they will play a “constructive” role.

Austria, which considers nuclear non-proliferation as an important principle of its foreign policy, was one of the leaders of the resolution to lead up to a legally-binding instrument to ban nuclear weapons. The resolution passed through the UN first committee with flying colours on October 27, but will have to now confirmed by the UN general assembly in December.

There was division among the nuclear weapon states in their voting pattern – India, Pakistan and China abstained, while the UK, Israel, the US, France and Russia voted against the resolution and only North Korea voted in favour.

Officially, India has still not yet decided whether to take part in the 2017 conference to draft the new convention.

A senior Austrian official told The Wire that there was no connection between India joining the conference and its NSG’s membership application. “These are not related,” he said. However, he indicated that India’s membership will take place before the new nuclear weapon prohibition treaty would be in place – which is a rather open-ended calendar.

However, while the NSG dream seems to be slipping away for now, India may soon become a member of the the second export control regime after joining the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The 2010 Indo-US joint statement had identified four export control regimes – the NSG, MTCR, the Australia Group and the Wassenaar Arrangement – whose portals would be knocked for India’s entry.

After MTCR, the Wassenaar Arrangement, which aims to regulate the spread of strategic and dual-use technologies, may soon be welcoming New Delhi, officials indicated. Unlike some other regimes, Wassenaar has specific criteria for entrants, which includes whether the country has adhered to guidelines of the NSG and the NPT. The operative word here is adherence, which means countries do not necessarily need to be signatories."
Modi Government's Defence of High Fuel Prices Is Flimsy,https://m.thewire.in/article/business/petrol-price-narendra-modi-government,"Sep 14, 2017  |  Prasenjit Bose","While international prices have fallen sharply from an annual average of $105 per barrel in 2013-14 to $46 per barrel in 2015-16 and 2016-17, the Centre has hiked excise duties on petrol and diesel over nine times.

The retail prices of diesel and petrol in September 2017 have either surpassed or nearly touched the levels prevailing in June 2014, when the Narendra Modi government had just been sworn into office.

The table below shows that while the retail price of diesel was Rs 57.28 per litre in Delhi on June 2, 2014 – when the international oil price was $106.88 per barrel – it has now reached a very similar price of Rs 58.72 per litre even though international oil prices are at $53.06 per barrel.

Table 1: Prices of Petrol and Diesel: International & Domestic

International crude oil price (Indian basket) Domestic retail price of petrol Domestic retail price of diesel $ per barrel Delhi Kolkata Mumbai Chennai Delhi Kolkata Mumbai Chennai 2-Jun-14 106.88 71.41 79.26 80 74.6 57.28 61.97 65.84 61.12 12-Sep-17 53.06 70.38 73.12 79.48 72.95 58.72 61.37 62.37 61.84 Source: PIB Press Releases Source: Indian Oil

When petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan says that the government does not intend to intervene in petro-product pricing – which is supposedly being determined by oil companies on a daily basis after price deregulation – he is being disingenuous.

This is because the excise duty on diesel currently stands at Rs 17.33 per litre and that on petrol at Rs 21.48 per litre. State-level taxes on petro-products vary across states. In Delhi, the VAT currently stands at Rs 8.68 per litre on diesel and Rs 14.96 per litre on petrol, which is significantly lower than the central excise duties.

With international crude oil prices falling sharply from the annual average of $105 per barrel in 2013-14 to $46 per barrel in 2015-16 and 2016-17, the Modi government has hiked excise duties on petrol and diesel over nine times in order to encash a windfall. Rather than passing on the benefits of low oil prices to the consumers, the Centre has utilised the petroleum sector for additional revenue mobilisation, which can be seen from Table 2 below.

Table 2: Taxes & Duties from the Petroleum Sector

In Rs. Crore 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 Central Taxes/Duties on Crude Oil & Petroleum Products 100339 106090 126219 209536 273502 of which, Excise Duty 73310 77982 99184 178591 242691 State Taxes/Duties on Crude Oil & Petroleum Products 136021 152442 160526 160114 188435 of which, Sales Tax/VAT 115036 129045 137157 142848 166378 % of GDP 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 Tax/Duties on Crude Oil & Petroleum Products 1.0 0.9 1.0 1.5 1.8 of which, Excise Duty 0.7 0.7 0.8 1.3 1.6 State Taxes/Duties on Crude Oil & Petroleum Products 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.2 of which, Sales Tax/VAT 1.2 1.1 1.1 1.0 1.1 Source: Ready Reckoner, June 2017, PPAC, MoP&NG, GoI

Excise duties annually raised from the petroleum sector increased from Rs 77,982 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 2,42,691 crore in 2016-17. Annual revenues from excise duties grew at 27% in 2014-15, 80% in 2015-16 and 36% in 2016-17, rising from 0.7% of GDP in 2013-14 to 1.6% of GDP in 2016-17. This substantial additional revenue mobilisation has enabled the Centre to balance its budget without making much effort to raise direct taxes.

It is also noteworthy that the state governments (taken together) have not followed this route and therefore the state-level annual sales tax/VAT revenues on petro-products have remained at 1.1% of GDP from 2013-14 to 2016-17. Revenue mobilisation from states’ sales tax/VAT increased by only by Rs 37,333 crore from 2013-14 to 2016-17, i.e. around 30% in three years, while the nominal increase in central excise revenues was to the tune of 257% during the same period. Thus it is the central government, and not the state governments, which has been milking the petroleum sector.

When international crude oil prices are showing an upward trend in recent times, the central government must bring down the excise duties rather than allowing the oil companies to raise the retail prices at will. Imposing high taxes on petro-products, which are necessities and hence display low price-elasticity of demand, is a soft option as far as revenue mobilisation is concerned.

At a time when GST has been introduced to rationalise indirect taxes (the extent to which that has been achieved is questionable though), it is indeed hypocritical to keep petro-products outside the GST ambit in order to raise additional central revenues. Rather than running after the chimera of a fiscal windfall through meaningless steps like demonetisation, the government should focus on ways and means to increase direct tax revenues from the more affluent sections of society.

Debate: Regret India's Decision to Ban Pak Scholars But Fostering Intellectual Exchange Important,https://m.thewire.in/article/south-asia/fostering-intellectual-exchange-often-best-means-of-support-association-for-asian-studies,"Jun 14, 2018  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: In response to calls that the Association for Asian Studies (AAS) should cancel their conference next month due to India’s ban on Pakistani scholars from attending it, and questions over whether the experiment to hold AAS-in-Asia conferences should be terminated, the officers of AAS have asked whether scholars should refuse to participate in international conferences held in any country with problematic government policies. “This would include the U.S., which has a blanket ban on potential participants from seven countries,” the officers said in a statement.

The Indian government had come under attack from all quarters when it recently came to light that it had explicitly directed the co-organisers of the July 5-8 AAS-in-Asia conference in New Delhi – AAS and Ashoka University – to not include any scholars from Pakistan.

In a previous statement to The Wire, the organisers had said that they “deeply regret” the decision of the Indian government as it was “not in tune with open exchange of ideas and knowledge”, but added that directive came too late in the day with preparations already underway for years.

The officers of AAS have in their latest statement – signed by its president, vice president and two former presidents – said that while the AAS board had before signing an memorandum of understanding with Ashoka University “raised the question of the difficulty of obtaining visas for individual scholars to travel to India,” they did not, however, “anticipate a blanket refusal to issue visas to all scholars from a given country. Nor did we know that the Indian government would also include in this prohibition people of Pakistani origin who hold other passports.”

They have further added: “The current officers of the Association are in agreement with those among our members who urge us to oppose restrictions on scholarly exchange across borders and to challenge such restrictions wherever possible. At the same time, we recognize the complex political climates in which many of our colleagues function. We believe that fostering intellectual exchange is often the best means of support, even though in many instances this will involve compromises rather than stances of absolute moral purity.”

Full text of their statement is reproduced below.

§

A controversy is developing among the AAS membership with regard to the AAS-in-Asia conference in Delhi, following the decision of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of the Government of India to deny visas to all Pakistani scholars. The AAS-in-Asia conferences began as an experiment four years ago. Two questions now face our membership: 1) Should the experiment to hold AAS-in-Asia conferences be terminated? and 2) How should AAS handle the current situation?

With regard to the first question, AAS members need to consider two sets of difficulties that arise in holding AAS conferences in Asia. The first is finding host institutions that are willing to provide the faculty, administrative staffing, and funding involved in organizing a conference that is now being attended by some 1,000 scholars. This is a challenge everywhere: even the smaller regional conferences affiliated with AAS stateside are finding it difficult in this age of budget cutbacks to find campuses willing to serve as host institutions. Securing a partner for a much larger event involves extended discussion of logistics, responsibilities, and finances.

The second major set of problems is political. With the possible exception of one or two countries in Asia, it is difficult to find a politically uncomplicated country to serve as a conference venue, so that issues of visas and academic freedom do not arise. As we know, the problem is no less acute in the U.S., where the latest iteration of the federal government’s travel ban puts restrictions on visitors from five predominantly Muslim countries and adds limits on certain travelers from two non-Muslim countries.

With regard to the second set of problems, AAS is coming under attack for two reasons: 1) for its decision to proceed with the conference being co-hosted by Ashoka University and 2) for the AAS’s failure to inform its members as soon as it learned of the Indian government’s decision not to grant visas to any scholars from Pakistan.

AAS and Ashoka University have been working on this conference since 2014. The AAS board felt that it was important to rotate the conference across the four regions into which AAS is divided, to counter the apparent East Asia bias in the previous conferences, which were held in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. Despite the many dynamic educational institutions and exciting scholarly research being carried out in South Asia, few scholars from that large region had been participating in the AAS-in-Asia conferences. When faculty and administrators at Ashoka University said they were willing to take on this responsibility, AAS was delighted. The board felt that Ashoka’s offer was an exciting opportunity to deepen scholarly exchanges across Asia, and we agreed to use a multi-tiered fee structure that made participation less expensive for scholars from South Asian (and some other) countries.

The AAS board did discuss issues of academic freedom prior to signing a memorandum of understanding with Ashoka University. Ashoka was firm in its commitment to the selection of panels on the basis of academic merit and breadth of participation across institutions and countries. These principles were honored in the selection of panels. We also raised the question of the difficulty of obtaining visas for individual scholars to travel to India; we did not, however, anticipate a blanket refusal to issue visas to all scholars from a given country. Nor did we know that the Indian government would also include in this prohibition people of Pakistani origin who hold other passports.

As soon as we learned of the MEA’s decision in early March of this year, back-channel efforts were begun to have the MEA’s blanket ruling reversed. In the third week of March, the Pakistani scholars whose panels had been selected for presentation at the conference (a total of eight people) were informed about the MEA ruling. They were offered the option of presenting their papers via Skype, as a way of ensuring our commitment to academic freedom and salvaging their valuable contributions as far as possible despite the MEA’s ruling. The MEA letter was posted on the conference website on March 6, and the subsequent letter from the Home Ministry, which arrived on April 6, was posted on April 9.

Scholars are now signing a petition not only denouncing the Indian government but also criticizing the way AAS has handled the situation and calling for us to cancel the conference. We acknowledge and understand those who question how AAS has handled the situation, and we respect their views as to how we should deal with it now. For those aware of the history between India and Pakistan, the fact that the MEA has denied visas to Pakistani scholars is, however reprehensible, not unexpected, given the tensions, border skirmishes, and three full wars between the two countries over the past seventy years. Knowing that there was even a possibility that the Indian government would deny visas, should AAS never have agreed to work with an Indian university to hold AAS-in-Asia in India? Further, knowing that there are political complications involved in virtually every country in Asia, should the AAS-in-Asia experiment be terminated?

While there are financial costs in canceling a conference for which reservations were made over a year in advance, there is a broader question to be addressed: Is there merit in working with Asian institutions in the hope of helping to strengthen academic freedoms and civil society, recognizing the contexts of current limitations? We might also go further to ask if scholars should refuse to participate in international conferences held in any country with problematic government policies. This would include the U.S., which has a blanket ban on potential participants from seven countries.

The current officers of the Association are in agreement with those among our members who urge us to oppose restrictions on scholarly exchange across borders and to challenge such restrictions wherever possible. At the same time, we recognize the complex political climates in which many of our colleagues function. We believe that fostering intellectual exchange is often the best means of support, even though in many instances this will involve compromises rather than stances of absolute moral purity.

Pakistan’s foreign office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal tweeted on February 7 that Islamabad had proposed that a Pakistani delegation travel to India on March 13, followed by a reciprocal visit by the Indian delegation on March 28.

In a spirit of constructive engagement #Pakistan has proposed to India that the Pakistan delegation may visit #India on 13 March followed by the return visit of the Indian delegation to Pakistan on 28 March to finalise the draft agreement for the #kartarpur corridor (1/2) — Dr Mohammad Faisal (@ForeignOfficePk) February 7, 2019

In less than an hour, India’s external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said that the Pakistani delegation was welcome to visit to India on March 13. “Follow up meeting can be held in Pakistan, as required,” he said.

We welcome the visit of #Pakistan team to discuss and finalise modalities for facilitating visit of pilgrims through #Kartarpur Sahib Corridor on 13 March 2019 to India. Follow up meeting can be held in Pakistan, as required. 1/2 — Raveesh Kumar (@MEAIndia) February 7, 2019

India has also asked Pakistan to hold “technical level discussions between engineers on both sides without waiting for discussion on the modalities”.

“We hope Pakistan would positively respond & confirm coordinates of crossing point as well,” he said.

India and Pakistan had last year agreed to start work on the Kartarpur corridor which would link two holy sites of the founder of Sikhism. This is the flagship project which will be launched on the occasion of 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak this year.

On January 21, Pakistan had asked India to urgently send a team to discuss the modalities and finalise the agreement. A day later, India publicly offered two set of dates for a Pakistani delegation to travel across the border. Pakistan responded by describing it as a “typical example of the childish behaviour of this Indian Government”."
TRAI Rules: Do Indian TV Viewers Have Greater Choice Now?,https://m.thewire.in/article/business/trai-rules-do-indian-tv-viewers-now-actually-have-greater-choice,"Mar 01, 2019  |  Shivangi Mittal","For a country that often falls victim to poorly designed economic policies, India seems to be learning few lessons. Economic policies may be well-intentioned, but implementation problems persist owing to deficient policy detailing.

While ineffective social policies and programmes can be blamed on political myopia and opportunism, there is little excuse for oversight by regulators endowed with technical expertise.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) new framework for the broadcasting sector demonstrates how the regulator could have paid greater attention to market realities in order to achieve its objective of providing greater consumer choice.

Ensuring that markets and businesses operate in a manner that is socially desirable requires that regulators provide them with adequate incentives to do so, especially in the absence of efficient enforcement mechanisms. Grievances related to the new regulatory framework for the television industry underscore the importance of incorporating appropriate incentives in regulatory design.

The telecom regulator’s latest regulation seeks to engender transparency and non-discrimination in the television supply chain, while promoting consumer choice and growth of the sector. It includes new rules for retail and wholesale pricing and outlines the terms of agreements signed between broadcasters and distributors (DTH, Cable TV operators, etc.).

Additionally, the regulation has implications for the pricing and bundling of TV channels, giving consumers greater freedom to customise their subscriptions. Despite prescribing a detailed overhaul of the television supply chain, the new framework fails to provide distributors with the necessary incentive to enhance consumer choice, thereby defeating one of its key objectives.

According to the new regulation, consumers are required to pay a fixed monthly fee to their service provider (distributor). This fee, known as ‘network capacity fee’, is intended to compensate distributors for their investments in network infrastructure, and is capped at Rs 130 for the first 100 channels.

While this is the prescribed upper limit, a report by CRISIL indicates that most service providers are charging consumers at the capped fee.

The 100 channels – known as the ‘Basic Service Tier’ – include channels which are mandatory to broadcast, such as Doordarshan, and other free-to-air channels. While retaining discretion in bundling these 100 channels, distributors are supposed to be mindful of customer preferences. However, there is little incentive for distributors to actually do so.

Irrespective of whether they engender a match between demand and supply of the 100 channels in the basic service tier, distributors receive the network capacity fee (NCF) every month. It is thus most profitable for them to include those channels in the pack for which they can negotiate lucrative deals with broadcasters, instead of including the channels that interest consumers.

For instance, distributors who are part of the same group of companies as a broadcaster might include channels of only those broadcasters in the basic service tier.

Consumers can replace channels in the basic service tier with channels of their choice. However, very few consumers seem to be aware of this, and many find it cumbersome to substitute these channels. According to statistics released by TRAI, only about 50% of the TV households in India have migrated to the new regime. Consumers who are not discerning enough to exercise their choice in the total number of TV channels that they subscribe to are unlikely to do so for the basic service tier as well.

Further, it is unlikely that greater consumer choice will be enforced through competitive forces. It is costly for consumers to switch service providers, since this likely entails having to purchase new equipment, besides having to choose subscription packs again. They may also have to forego payments that they have made in advance to their previous operator. That a considerable number of consumers will switch to a different service provider is thus not a credible threat to induce a distributor to change the composition of the basic service tier that it offers.

It would also be impractical to expect TRAI to monitor consumer preferences and penalise distributors who do not provide channels which match consumer preferences. Thus, incentivising distributors to take cognisance of consumer tastes while selecting channels for the basic service tier is the only way that TRAI can truly enable consumer choice.

The NCF serves as an appropriate remedy for the lack of transparency in the dealings between broadcasters and distributors in the previous regime, but disincentiveses the distributor from appropriately provisioning for greater consumer choice.

As distributors now get a monthly fee to cover costs, they no longer have to resort to illicit practices such as under-reporting the number of subscribers to broadcasters, or charging consumers for watching free-to-air channels. However, it does not address the problem of distributors including channels that consumers do not wish to watch as part of the basic service tier. The fee has thus introduced an imbalance among the various objectives of this regulatory framework. In its current form, the regulation inadvertently prioritises the objective of ensuring transparency over that of providing greater consumer choice.

Such an imbalance changes the distribution of value among businesses and consumers, without ensuring that benefits accrue proportionately. Implementing the new framework has caused a considerable amount of confusion and controversy in the 183 million television-subscriber households across the country, and most reports indicate that TV bills have gone up for those who have migrated to the new regime. Despite this, the choice which TRAI sought to provide will not be available to consumers. Once again, an otherwise meticulously designed piece of regulation will prove to be insufficient because it fails to accommodate the correct balance of stakeholder incentives.

"Let's Not Demonise Britain Over the ICJ, India Wants to Be Elite Too",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-icj-uk-nationalism-bhandari,"Nov 24, 2017  |  Tunku Varadarajan","Nationalist chest-thumping is for lightweights and losers. India is neither.

There has been unbridled exultation in India after the election of Dalveer Bhandari to the International Court of Justice. Ravi Shankar Prasad, the country’s law minister, was moved to Tweet “Bharat Mata ki Jai!”

India’s rise in ease of doing business, upgrading of ratings by Moody’s followed by election of Justice #DalveerBhandari at #ICJ where hundreds of countries supported India only reinforces the resurgent India under @narendramodi. Bharat Mata Ki Jai! — Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad) November 21, 2017

The normally circumspect Sushma Swaraj, India’s foreign minister, trumped that tweet with a jubilant “Vande Mataram” and “Jai Hind”.

The tone and din in the media – among those reporting and commenting on the victory of saadda Dalveer over the perfidious Britishers – was akin to that found in cricket stadiums when India plays a one-day international: Jeetega bhai jeetega, India jeetega! It all seemed like a replay at the United Nations of Mohun Bagan’s cathartic victory in 1911 over the East Yorkshire Regiment. Or to put it in more demotic terms, it was like Lagaan. Plucky little Indians take on snooty, arrogant Brits and get the better of them with a mixture of native wit and karmic justice.

This is unseemly, and also a strategic mistake. India approached the run-off vote between Justice Bhandari and Christopher Greenwood as if it were a David-and-Goliath affair. It positioned itself as the virtuous Outsider, fighting for the rights of ordinary nations against the might of the P5, the five permanent members of the United Nations. But India isn’t David. And it isn’t an ordinary nation, except in its own self-effacing rhetoric.

The idea of the P5 can be jarring. This veto-wielding elite enjoys privileges galore under the UN Charter, as well as a host of customary advantages by virtue of its Security Council status. One of those advantages was an asserted right to a seat on the ICJ. As a result, the United Kingdom has had a judge in the world court ever since 1946 – until this week.

This hasn’t been a bad thing. Britain is the intellectual home of much of modern public international law. The best judges on the ICJ have invariably been British. Remarkably, the finest public international lawyer never to have made it to the ICJ was also British – the late Ian Brownlie of Oxford University. (It was always whispered that his communist leanings as a young man kept him off the bench.) Justice Greenwood is a superb international lawyer, and there can be no argument that he is streets ahead of Justice Bhandari in intellect and ability. (Don’t be misled by all the criticism of Greenwood’s advice to Tony Blair on the Iraq War. His counsel was impeccable, given the evidence – now known to be dodgy – presented to him.)

But, to put it bluntly, the ICJ is a political body masquerading as a legal one. It is a constructive masquerade, of course, for a veneer of legality in international relations is better than no veneer (or no law) at all. So, while the departure of Justice Greenwood will diminish the overall quality of the court’s legal reasoning, it’s important to remember that only some of its cases are purely legal. Even in highly technical matters such as the delimitation of a continental shelf shared by two states, equitable considerations play as much a part as legal principles.

My point, however, isn’t to focus on the quality of the ICJ’s jurisprudence, or on the impact on that jurisprudence of Justice Bhandari’s re-election. It is to say that India needs, very quickly, to dial back the “neocolonial grievance” narrative that accompanied its bid for Bhandari. India is aggrieved by its exclusion from permanent membership of the Security Council. It has every right to be. The absence of the world’s biggest democracy is a travesty, one that will be compounded – if the UN Charter isn’t amended by then – when India overtakes China as the world’s most populous nation.

Yet India needs to be very careful, and scrupulously self-interested, in the manner in which it approaches this question. It wants the gates of permanent membership to be unlocked to let India in, not thrown so wide open that permanent membership becomes a meaningless thing. India should aspire to a form of permanent membership that resembles the current arrangement as closely as possible. It wants to be able to share in a global elite status, not be an instrument for an erosion of that status. It will ideally want a veto. And yes, like Britain, it will want an expectation that its candidate be a judge on the ICJ.

So, having played the “poor-Third-World-anticolonial” card for Justice Bhandari, it needs quickly to tear that card to shreds. India’s interests lie, now, in always asserting its strength, its exceptionalism, its heft and its status as one of the world’s indispensable nations. If India wants permanent membership of the Security Council, it has to start thinking like an elite country. And that means no ululation when its judges get elected to the ICJ, and no “Bharat mata ki jai” from its cabinet ministers on Twitter. Nationalist chest-thumping is for lightweights and losers. India is neither.

'Wide Angle' Episode 3: The Curious History of India-Pakistan Relations

Maya Mirchandani interviews India's former high commissioner to Pakistan T.C.A. Raghavan about his new book 'The People Next Door: The Curious History of India's Relations with Pakistan'."
Editorial: India and Pakistan Should De-Escalate Now,https://m.thewire.in/article/security/editorial-india-and-pakistan-should-de-escalate-now,"Mar 01, 2019  |  Editorial","India’s “non-military” military action against a Jaish-e-Muhammad establishment in Balakot, Pakistan and Pakistan’s retaliatory “non-relatiation” by dropping bombs on locations in Rajouri have brought the two countries to a crossroads. On one side lies the uncertain and hazardous road to a destination neither side would like to reach. And on the other, the possibility of de-escalation. It is essential that both India and Pakistan choose that option.

The fact that both India and Pakistan have lost a fighter jet each and that an Indian pilot is in Pakistani custody underlines the unpredictable nature of armed conflict. The pilot is likely to be released shortly and handed back to the Indian side. His return provides the perfect optic for the Indian side to scale back its rhetoric and find diplomatic means of building upon whatever it believes it has accomplished on the counter-terrorism front in the past three days.

Kinetic operations may yield benefits at the tactical level in the fight against terrorism but it is foolish to think the problem of terrorism can be defeated by military means alone. Since independence, India has fought four wars with Pakistan but the country’s political and military leadership always had clear and finite aims – even for the wars it did not initiate. At Kargil, for example, the goal was to evict Pakistani intruders from areas that were on the Indian side of the Line of Control and ensure the sanctity of the line.

Ending terrorism is a valid objective of Indian policy but only jingoist anchors and retired military hotheads on television believe this can be done by going up the escalatory ladder whose first rung was the airstrike on Balakot. The Narendra Modi government, which has both stoked the flames of hypernationalism and tried to use it for political benefit, must not allow irresponsible rhetoric to get the better of its political judgment. The official line is that ‘talks and terror’ cannot co-exist. The problem with this formulation is that the opposite does not hold: ‘no talks’ and terror very much exist together, as we have seen over the past few years. And as the problem persists, there is always the inherent danger that politicians will begin to believe war is the only way to end the problem of terror. While there is ample evidence from around the world about the limits and dangers of using mainly or exclusively military means against terrorism, the risk on the India-Pakistan front is apparent.

Pakistan has an obligation to act against terrorist groups on its soil and Prime Minister Imran Khan needs to be clear that his offer of dialogue, if not matched by evidence on the ground of action against the Jaish-e-Mohammad and others, will never yield anything – even if the Indian side were to grasp it, which we hope it will."
Roping in Foreign Academics to Prepare Course Content for Indian Universities Makes No Sense,https://m.thewire.in/article/education/roping-in-foreign-academics-to-prepare-course-content-for-indian-universities-makes-no-sense,"Jun 12, 2016  |  Pushkar","Why does the government not utilise the services of academics returning to India after studying or working abroad for designing and internationalising the courses?

It was recently revealed that the human resource development (HRD) ministry has roped in experts from leading global universities, including the University of Edinburgh, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge University and the University of Pennsylvania, to help design and internationalise the syllabuses at higher education institutions in the country.

There is nothing unusual in seeking assistance from experts and/or academic institutions abroad for higher education. However, one does have to consider if such assistance, whether paid for or not, is needed in the first place. In many cases, a big deal is made of foreign assistance when it is actually for the most trivial of reasons and serves no particular objective. The larger issue is whether international assistance can play a role in improving the quality of higher education and, if yes, what kind of help from abroad could make a difference for the better.

The truth is that roping in foreign academics to prepare the course content for our universities makes no sense at all. It is completely unnecessary.

Why foreign assistance?

Over the past decade or so, foreign assistance, broadly defined, has acquired growing relevance for India’s higher education. Part of the reason seems to lie in the failure of our universities to break into the ranks of the top 100-200 institutions in the world and, more generally, the persistence of mediocrity across the higher education sector. There seems to be an implicit acknowledgement, on the part of the government as well, that Western assistance, or at least some kind of borrowing or inspiration from Western models, will help improve the overall quality of higher education and perhaps even propel our best institutions into high world rankings.

It is useful to recall that international assistance of various kinds played a key and direct role in developing some of the first IITs, notably those at Mumbai and Kanpur. IIT-Bombay in fact received direct assistance from the USSR in the form of Russian roubles via UNESCO. More recently, US assistance has been sought for the newer IITs. In fact, foreign help is also being sought for other kinds of higher education institutions, in a variety of ways. Unlike the 1950s and the 1960s, however, when this sort of assistance was absolutely critical for newly-independent, poor and technologically-backward India that was woefully short on trained scientists, engineers, etc., it is not always clear why such assistance is necessary in the 2010s.

Seeking help

In recent years, the Indian government has been seeking help from abroad in a variety of ways. For example, since at least the 2000s, the government has been contemplating opening up the higher education sector to foreign universities. The NITI Aayog recently proposed the same. While this initiative does not count as ‘foreign assistance’ as properly understood, the logic behind it is common: that the ‘foreign’ component will be beneficial to India. Foreign universities are not only expected to bring world-class education to India but also have a positive impact on the quality of education at other academic institutions.

Take another example. The Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) has been launched to bring some of the best known academics in the west to India for short periods, both to teach and to explore common areas for research with Indian academics. GIAN promises to connect recognised institutions, notably central universities, IITs and IIMs with the best scholars and institutions in the US. The government’s expectation is that, among other things, GIAN will be beneficial for the adoption of new methods of pedagogy, boosting research in cutting-edge technologies and building stronger academic networks between both countries.

The government has also encouraged, through financial assistance and other means, collaborations between our universities with those abroad so that our academics benefit from such interaction and begin to contribute more significantly to knowledge production. Again, while the term ‘assistance’ does not seem to apply in such collaborative endeavours, the fact is that we are expected to gain more from them.

Even before Narendra Modi came to power, the government had started to give serious consideration to implementing the American model of community colleges in order to improve the skills of hundreds of millions of young Indians. Continuing on the same path, earlier this April, the current government approved 157 colleges and universities for running community colleges.

Justifying the need for help

The examples given above do not exhaust the broad range of foreign assistance initiatives that the government has taken up or extended in the recent past. As noted earlier, it has been reported that we are seeking assistance from some leading universities to design and internationalise the syllabuses at our universities. According to HRD minister Smriti Irani:

The government of India has been in touch with some international faculty and academicians and institutions who shall through RUSA, a national higher education mission, help states internationalise their curriculum in order to benefit their students.

On the face of it, headlines such as ‘Cambridge, MIT experts to help design syllabuses of Indian institutions‘ appear to be a worthy initiative, marking a big step forward in improving the quality of higher education. It is not a secret that the course syllabuses at most of our academic institutions are dated and revisions are carried out rather infrequently. The thinking seems to be that if foreign experts revise and update course content, this will independently and perhaps even immediately benefit our students in very tangible ways.

The truth is that roping in foreign academics to prepare the course content for our universities makes no sense at all. It is completely unnecessary.

Over the decades, hundreds of thousands of Indian students have headed abroad to some of the best universities in the UK, US and elsewhere for undergraduate and post-graduate degrees. While many of them have not returned, and most have not taken up the academic profession, scores of them have returned. Many have been mentored by some of the biggest names in their respective disciplines. A good number of them have made or are making a name for themselves on their own. Such foreign-trained academics can be found all across the country at different kinds of academic institutions, including research centres and think tanks.

One wonders why there is so little mention of brain-gain, even if it is quite small in comparison to the brain-drain that is taking place, and why the government does not utilise the services of these academics for designing and internationalising courses. Is it because government officials believe, as many others do, that those who have returned have done so because they are not good enough? Surely, at least some of those who have returned are competent enough to draft course outlines and such! But it is also the case that newspaper headlines on MIT or Oxford faculty lending a hand in updating course syllabuses sounds cooler than quietly seeking the help of India-based MIT-, Oxford- or CalTech-trained academics.

The other bothersome thing about using the services of MIT or Stanford academics for preparing course content for our universities is that in most cases, the syllabuses used by these experts is often easily available online and, when not, can be obtained quite conveniently. Surely, India-trained academics are at least capable enough to download and adapt the syllabuses at Harvard or Oxford for our universities.

The most damning case against seeking the help of foreign experts in this matter is that updating the syllabuses will have zero impact on the quality of education. Think about it. In the end, we need qualified faculty to teach the subject matter and we do not seem to have sufficient numbers of suitably-qualified faculty – even for the IITs and central universities. Perhaps more than other issues, the problem of faculty shortages and/or the reluctance of our academic institutions to hire qualified people needs to be addressed first. Indeed, there are scores of examples where qualified faculty are chased away from their respective universities or research centres because they are competent and do their job well.

Selective foreign assistance

At the same time, there is no doubt that we need foreign assistance, especially to improve the quality of higher education. However, in many cases, we seem to be seeking assistance in a way that is not needed. We are also underutilising our existing human resources, including scores of people who have studied abroad at some of the best institutions in the world. Yes, initiatives like GIAN will be beneficial for our higher education in the long run but why should we not be making better use of already-available human resources?

Seeking foreign assistance as keenly as we are doing, at least on paper, is also a denial of the real problems in higher education which are homegrown and will not be resolved in the least through foreign assistance of any kind. Initiatives such as using foreign experts to upgrade course content are purely cosmetic and will not do much to improve the quality of education. Instead, the government should really be pushing universities to hire qualified faculty and retain them. The government must also upgrade the infrastructure at those institutions which are capable and interested in increasing their faculty strength. Until that time, whatever help we get from abroad will have at best a limited impact on higher education.

Babul Supriyo at Jadavpur University: Imagining Universities as Temples,https://m.thewire.in/article/education/babul-supriyo-at-jadavpur-university-imagining-universities-as-temples,"Sep 23, 2019  |  Debaditya Bhattacharya","The fracas occasioned by the visit of singer-turned-BJP-parliamentarian Babul Supriyo on the campus of Jadavpur University has left behind a precious moral fable.

Despite clear indications to the contrary for years now, the fig leaf of institutional autonomy was still a part of legislative lore – with which we covered up the shameful exposure of our universities to the political establishment. Supriyo stripped the myth down to its real obscenity, in his short snatches of conversation with the vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University.

Even while the mayhem was raging on, and university property vandalised, videos surfaced on social media of the Union minister angrily chiding the VC about having orchestrated the protests against him. A visibly perturbed Suranjan Das, a well-known academic in his own right, was questioned about why he did not come to “receive” the minister on his visit. Just as Das was seen explaining to Supriyo that the event in question was organised by a student political outfit (ABVP), to which he himself was not invited, the BJP leader’s aggression peaked into a convulsive tirade: “I am sure you are a leftist!”

Whether or not Das is a leftist is a redundant debate. What is significant is Supriyo’s accusation – that to be a leftist is to be a criminal, a violator of “law and order”.

From a government that packs its jails with human rights activists and calls them “urban Naxals”, names “a red-coloured book” found at G.N. Saibaba’s residence as incriminating evidence, unleashes its police contingent to raid houses of university teachers for ‘leftist’ books, and stocks university administrations with stooges who demand CVs from arguably the best living historian of the country, this should not be unexpected. But as a society, we must be deeply worried if ‘leftist’ beliefs in themselves are regarded as a transgression of the law.

That one statement by a Union minister, within a university campus, spells doom for the Indian constitution and its inaugural pledge to a secular socialist imagination.

To return to the immediate context of the verbal assault on Das, it might be useful to alert the minister to how universities are instituted through Acts of parliament as structurally ‘autonomous’ bodies. Section 9(1)(b)(ii) of the Jadavpur University Act strives for this autonomy by maintaining that “a person shall not be qualified to be the Vice Chancellor if he is a member of, or otherwise associated with, any political party”.

Legally therefore, a VC “receiving” a Union minister attending the institution for a political event may be regarded as acting in a “partisan manner while in office” – a substantive ground for removal of a VC, as per the Act. It would be a patent lie to claim that such sights of servility are uncommon in state-funded higher educational institutions, but to openly demand them is to make peace with the feudal roots of the Indian university. To pretend otherwise is to at least acknowledge the difference between what is practised and what is just.

Babul Supriyo – representing a party whose prime minister believes that a Harvard degree is worth less than his own ‘hard work’ – was soon seen commanding the VC (now, an alleged ‘leftist’) to do some ‘work’ by fetching him a glass of water.

What is the ‘work’ that liberal metropolitan state universities (like Jadavpur University) are expected to do, and for which the provincial public-funded universities provide a model already? On September 18, just a day before Supriyo’s misadventure, the VC of the Central University of South Bihar – in the Hindi heartland of Gaya – set an example of the ‘hard working’ Indian university. This is an institution which has ranked itself into the dregs of the national frameworks of excellence, and aspires to ‘world-class’ pedagogy in the near future.

Having invited “His Holiness Puripeethadhishwar Jagatguru Shankaracharya Swami Nishchalananda Saraswati Jee” (the Puri Shankaracharya), the said VC was seen prostrating himself on stage while a newly-appointed teacher of physics was made to perform a ‘paduka-poojan’ (worshipping the saint’s footwear).

The VC welcomed the Lord Almighty’s delegate – in the presence of all local RSS functionaries – by ruing that he could not invite a ‘sant’ (saint) to inaugurate his university campus. However, this grand academic lecture, on the “nature and relevance of Vedic mathematics”, was his mode of penance. There was acoustic accompaniment all through, with vows of cow protection and demands for a ban on cow slaughter.

Needless to say, this was the accurate setting and build-up to a seminar that Supriyo perhaps wanted in Jadavpur University. But alas – unlike Shankaracharya, who ducked mathematics altogether to talk about how universities must counter materialist knowledge and communist belief-systems, Supriyo started flexing his muscles by linking ‘leftism’ to a VC. The ‘sant’ instead chronicled how the first batch of students from Banaras Hindu University – contrary to its founder Malaviya’s intentions – grew up to be “communists”, and how that long tradition of misdirected university learning is now sought to be corrected by cleaning (safaai) JNU of “communists”.

Clearly, Supriyo’s pronouncement on Jadavpur University’s VC is part of the “surgical strike” that BJP leaders have been plotting on college campuses. It is a strike which, as their patron-saint in Shankaracharya believes, will heal the Indian university of its germs of thinking and questioning the powers that be. The tottering Indian economy needs to re-erect the university as a ‘temple’ – of ‘learning’, as they say. Of learning to obey.

Mahua Moitra’S Plight Is Testament To The Kismet Of Women Politicians In India,https://m.thewire.in/article/women/mahua-moitras-plight-is-testament-to-the-kismet-of-women-politicians-in-india,"Nov 19, 2023  |  Prerna Dhoop and Vandana Dhoop","At a time when parliament finally passed a law reserving one-third of total seats for women in the House of the People and Legislative Assembly of every state, the targeting of MP Mahua Moitra under the guise of unsubstantiated charges is a reminder of how ‘gender’ and the ‘performance of femininity’ shape the life of women leaders across the political sphere.

Let’s observe the statistics first. The Rajya Sabha has only 31 women among 239 total members and in the Lok Sabha, only 82 of the 539 members are women. When it comes to the Government of India, only 10 women find representation in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 79-member council of ministers, out of which only two hold cabinet rank. The picture at the state level is bleaker, with the national average of women in state assemblies being around 9%. India’s rank on the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index 2023 is 127 out of 146, with the country trailing behind neighbours like Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

In the 2019 general election, out of the 435 candidates that the Bharatiya Janata Party fielded, 12.6% were women. Women constituted 12.9% of the total candidates fielded by the Indian National Congress. On the other hand, some regional parties’ selection of women candidates was quite commendable. Of the total number of candidates fielded by West Bengal’s All-India Trinamool Congress, 37.1% were women.

Evidently, what are typically viewed as ‘gender neutral’ public institutions and political parties in India are exclusively ‘for, by and of’ men. Rather, ‘masculinity’ is the defining feature of Indian politics. On its own, the Women’s Reservation Act, 2023 cannot enable greater political participation of women and their equal representation in parliament and politics.

In a 2021 book titled Women, Power, and Political Representation: Canadian and Comparative Perspectives, the authors have acknowledged that the introduction of gender quotas has improved women’s participation in Canadian politics. However, Canadian women still face many informal and formal barriers – not just when they seek to gain access to political power but also once they have gained that power. They have cautioned that, “women need not just be present in politics, but rather should have access to key positions of power where they can act as gatekeepers, agenda setters, and political insiders”. The Moitra matter reinforces the same lesson.

Indian politics has constructed a sexual imagery of women leaders that primarily focuses on their character, physical appearance, dress, demeanour and family. They are closely watched and their performance minutely scrutinised. While their success is understated and mostly shoved under the carpet, their failure is wholly attributed to their gender.

Indian news reporting on women MPs like Moitra is pervaded by gendered perceptions of ambition, visibility, competitiveness, suitability and capability. Her association with a leading businessman and fight with an ex-lover over Henry, their pet dog, have become more newsworthy than her attendance and performance in parliament. Conversely, her participation in parliamentary debates, the type of questions she has raised, and the veracity of her criticisms of the kleptocratic tendencies of the ruling dispensation have been largely ignored.

None of those pillorying Moitra have bothered to analyse how many of questions she has raised in Parliament have a direct link with her businessman friend, Darshan Hiranandani, whose office staff helped her upload those questions. When it is common practice for MPs to share their login details and even one-time-passwords (OTPs) with personal assistants, office staff, policy clerks, interns and others – the authors and almost all LAMP fellows who have worked with MPs from different political parties will easily vouch for this fact – why is Mahua Moitra being singled out?

The Lok Sabha Ethics Committee, which was established in 2015 to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members and examine cases of misconduct referred to it, has been operating without a proper written ‘Code of Conduct for Members of Lok Sabha’ and a mandatory ‘Declaration of Members’ Business Interests’. It is highly probable that in the absence of these two important documents, the committee can cherry-pick cases involving MPs from opposition parties while going easy with ruling party members. Further, the committee can also conduct hearings without following a fair, just and impartial procedure – as was seen in the Moitra matter, where she was not allowed to cross-examine those who had levelled grave charges against her. This violates the norms of natural justice in a constitutional democracy.

It has not escaped anyone’s notice that the committee has been super swift to investigate Moitra’s alleged association with Hiranandani. On the other hand, its response has been extremely tardy with respect to the conduct of BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri who made communal and sexist comments against several MPs including Danish Ali, a member of the Ethics Committee.

In order to avert sexual objectification, increase their acceptability within politics and be ‘likeable’ among the masses, women leaders have taken to supposedly asexual, respectable and dignified titles like ‘Didi’ Mamata Banerjee (elder sister), ‘Behenji’ Mayawati (sister), ‘Amma’ Jayalalitha (mother). Even Moitra has chanted ‘Jai Ma Durga’ and invoked the powerful Hindu goddess on X (formerly Twitter) to fight off the attacks on herself from the BJP. We cannot forget that as a woman politician, she has to work over time to not let the scandal blight her political career.

Unfortunately, there exists zero female sorority in Indian politics. Women politicians do not get the requisite support from peers in their own political party, nor are formal institutional mechanisms available to check misogyny and bullying. When the Ethics Committee quizzed MP Moitra about her private life, none of the women members of the committee responded. Women leaders find it extremely difficult to support their ilk across party lines because they are unable to reconcile their gender identity and political differences. Explaining the reality of female misogyny, feminist writer Chimamanda Adichie has commented, “[A]nd there are many women in the world who do not like other women.” This is writ large in Indian politics.

Ireland’s landmark 2009 report on ‘Women’s Participation in Politics’ has found that factors such as ‘less confidence’, ‘gendered culture’ and ‘gender bias in political parties’ in candidate’s selection procedures’ adversely affect women politicians. Particularly in India, because the Parliament, state assemblies and political parties are mainly led and run by men, the culture of behaviour and the informally accepted norms of language, views and expressions render the political sphere unsuitable for women.

Moitra walked out of the Ethics Committee’s meeting as a mark of protest and lashed out against the committee’s unfair procedure, manner of investigation and content of the questions. While people were left aghast at her audacity, the ruling dispensation has called her remarks ‘explosive’. Kimberle Crenshaw’s words can be used to describe the Indian society for which “saving honour from shame is a priority. Unfortunately, this priority tends to be more readily interpreted as obliging women not to scream rather than obliging men not to hit”.

With such a deep-seated culture of misogyny, what will it take for Indian lawmakers to remodel Parliament into a truly diverse, inclusive and accommodating place of work?

Health Ministry Refutes UN Agency Report on 1.1 Million Measles Vaccinations Missed in India,https://m.thewire.in/article/health/health-ministry-refutes-un-agency-report-on-1-1-million-measles-vaccinations-missed-in-india,"Nov 19, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: The Indian health ministry on Saturday (November 18) challenged UN data on measles vaccinations in India, claiming that nearly 21,000 children had missed their first dose according to the ministry’s data as opposed to 1.1 million claimed in the reports.

The WHO and Unicef Estimates National Immunisation Coverage (WUENIC) in a joint report released earlier this year estimated that 1.1 million children had missed their first dose of the measles vaccine between January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022.

The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the US Centres for Disease Control published on Friday (November 17) has cited this estimate. It lists India among the top 10 countries with infants who hadn’t received the measles first dose in 2022. India is fourth on the list after Nigeria (3 million), the Democratic Republic of Congo (1.8 million) and Ethiopia (1.7 million), the Telegraph reported.

The health ministry said UN data on India does “not reflect the true picture”, and pointed out that the ministry’s Health Management Information System shows that 26,363,270 among 26,384,580 eligible children had received the measles first dose during 2022-23, the Telegraph report said.

The ministry also said that it had taken multiple initiatives to ensure that all children receive all measles vaccine doses. Going by the ministry’s data, India has achieved 95% coverage which is imperative to combat the virus.

However, according to the experts quoted by the paper, the geographic distribution of the missed doses is needed to determine whether the immunisation gaps have left children in some pockets vulnerable.

“For measles, we need 95% coverage at all levels – state, district, city, town, village,” Tarun Bhatnagar, a scientist and public health specialist in the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai told the Telegraph. A country-level figure, Bhatnagar said, might mask uneven vaccination coverage and gaps at local levels.

He said that while it was not unusual for differences to show up between the ministry’s data and an estimate based on a modelling exercise, the difference between 1.1 million and 21,000 “is staggeringly large”.

This is the latest in a line of rows over health statistics. The health ministry has previously questioned estimates of Covid-19 deaths in the country and opposed the findings of a WHO exercise that pointed to more deaths than India’s official figures."

New Delhi: A Palestine supporter donning a t-shirt that said ‘stop bombing Palestine’ on one side and ‘free Palestine’ on the other invaded the pitch during the India-Australia cricket World Cup final in Ahmedabad today, November 19.

They also appeared to hold a pride flag in his hand, which has been reported by some news organisations as a Palestine flag.

The person was in a mask – also with the Palestine flag on it – and appeared to want to embrace star batsman Virat Kohli, who was batting with K.L. Rahul at that point, during the 14th over of the match. The Palestine-supporter was led away by security persons.

The moment was not shown on live telecasts but images were shared by multiple news sites and social media commentators.

The world of sports has played home to significant protest for Palestine as it continues to face the worst of Israel’s retaliation to an October 7 attack by Hamas.

In a latest update, the WHO has called for an evacuation from Gaza’s largest hospital, Al Shifa, calling it a “death zone.” Israel and Hamas have reportedly reached a tentative deal to free hostages and pause fighting."
"A Day After Taking Over, New Maldives President Officially Asks India to Withdraw Its Troops",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/maldives-president-asks-india-to-withdraw-its-troops,"Nov 18, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: A day after being sworn in, the new Maldives president has officially asked India to “honour [the] democratic will” of the Maldivian people by withdrawing Indian troops from the island nation.

The request was made public by the president’s office on Saturday (November 18).

It was made by the new President Mohamed Muizzu in his meeting with Indian earth sciences minister Kiren Rijiju, who called on him at the president’s office.

The Indian minister had attended Muizzu’s swearing-in ceremony on Friday.

While the Maldives president’s office revealed the request, there has been official silence from the Indian side.

A post on X (formerly Twitter) by Rijiju only stated that he conveyed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s greetings and “reiterated India’s commitment to further strengthen the substantive bilateral cooperation and robust people-to-people ties”.

Privileged to call on President H.E. Dr. Mohamed Muizzu.

Speaking to The Wire on phone from Malé, Ibrahim Khaleel, minister of strategic communication at the president’s office, noted that soon after Muizzu won the election, he had started dialogue with the Indian high commissioner about the issue of Indian troops.

“He has now formally requested India to withdraw troops in his meeting with the Indian minister,” he said.

Stating that the meeting had been “very positive”, Khaleel dismissed concerns that the request would negatively impact India-Maldives relations, asserting that “both countries respect each other”.

The Maldives had first released a Dhivehi language press release, which was just two sentences long and tersely reported that Muizzu had formally made a request for the withdrawal of Indian defence personnel.

In contrast, the English language press release was more expansive and also included praise for the operation of the Indian choppers.

The Maldivian readout of the meeting referred to the origin of the demand as as an electoral promise.

“The President noted that at the Presidential Election held in September, the Maldivian people had given him a strong mandate to make the request to India and expressed the hope that India will honour the democratic will of the people of the Maldives,” it said.

Muizzu also “acknowledged the significant role of the two helicopters in providing numerous emergency medical evacuations”.

While there is no official response from New Delhi, Indian sources indicated that India has taken a conciliatory position on the demand for the withdrawal of its military personnel “present in [the] Maldives for operating aircraft for medical evacuation and counter-drug trafficking purposes.”

“It was agreed that the two Governments would discuss workable solutions for continued cooperation through the use of these platforms as this serves the interests of the people of Maldives,” said sources about India’s response to the demand.

Indian sources also highlighted Muizzu’s appreciation for the role of Indian helicopters and aircraft in the medical evacuation of Maldivian citizens.

The Maldives National Defence Force had posted on its official account about the latest medical evacuation achieved using a Dornier gifted by India, which was also underlined by Indian official sources.

“They are also central to the confidence that international tourists have staying on remote islands. He appreciated their role in monitoring and combating drug trafficking,” they added.

Earlier in the day, Maldives’ new foreign minister Moosa Zameer responded to his Indian counterpart’s congratulatory message by referring to the need to “recalibrate” the relationship.

“I look forward to working with you on issues of mutual interest and concern, and to recalibrate and advance the time-tested relationship between our two countries for the betterment of our people,” he replied to Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Over a month ago, Muizzu convincingly defeated incumbent Ibrahim Solih after a campaign which was largely centred around a commitment to force India to withdraw its troops allegedly stationed in the Indian Ocean archipelago nation.

The leitmotif of the opposition’s campaign has been the ‘India Out’ slogan, attempting to corner Solih for his allegedly close ties with New Delhi.

In an interview with Channel News Asia on Friday, the new president was quick to point out that resetting the Maldives’s foreign policy would be one of his priorities in the first 100 days of his government.

He had reiterated that the withdrawal of Indian troops would be at the top of his agenda.

“The people of [the] Maldives have very clearly spoken during this campaign, that they have given me a mandate of removing foreign military presence from the Maldives. Whether it’s India or any other country, it doesn’t matter to us,” he told the Singapore-based news channel.

This is not the first time that a Maldives president has asked for the withdrawal of Indian troops.

In June 2018, President Abdulla Yameen had refused to renew the contract for two advanced light helicopters gifted by New Delhi and called for the removal of Indian security personnel.

At that time, India had around six navy pilots and several ground personnel to operate the two choppers, which were being used as air ambulances.

Relations between India and the Maldives had already nosedived under Yameen’s administration, but the demand to India to withdraw its personnel was not carried out.

A few months later, Yameen lost elections to joint opposition candidate Ibrahim Solih. The Indian PM had attended Solih’s swearing-in ceremony in November 2018.

Under the Solih administration, India has also funded several major projects, including the Greater Malé Connectivity project, which was touted as the largest such infrastructure development project in the Maldives.

President Muizzu also underlined the “importance of accelerating the Greater Male Connectivity Project (GMCP), highlighted the importance of addressing and overcoming the issues delaying the project”, the Maldivian readout noted."
"What Parliament Panel Said on Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, Which Seeks To Replace Indian Evidence Act",https://m.thewire.in/article/government/what-parl-panel-said-on-bharatiya-sakshya-bill-which-seeks-to-replace-the-indian-evidence-act,"Nov 18, 2023  |  Sravasti Dasgupta","New Delhi: While the Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, 2023, which seeks to replace the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, provides for “any information” that is given electronically as oral evidence, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, tasked with examining the proposed legislation, has recommended the deletion of these words, saying that this could cause serious complications in its interpretations.

The committee has also cautioned against the tampering of evidence and recommended “safeguarding the authenticity and integrity of electronic and digital records acquired during the course of investigation.”

The Bill, along with the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill (which seeks to replace the Indian Penal Code, 1870) and the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill, 2023, (which seeks to replace the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973), was referred to the 31-member committee after it was introduced in parliament on August 11 by Union home minister Amit Shah.

The committee adopted its report last week.

In their dissent notes, opposition MPs have criticised these Bills for being “copy-paste” legislations and flagged drafting errors and the haste with which they are being pushed through.

The Wire analyses the main recommendations of the committee report on the Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, 2023.

“Any information” given electronically

The Bill defines evidence as oral and documentary.

Oral evidence includes “statements or any information given electronically which the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses in relation to matters of fact under inquiry and such statements or information”, while it defines documentary evidence as documents, “including electronic or digital records produced for the inspection of the court.”

In the Bill, the definition of “documents” has been expanded to include electronic or digital records on emails, server logs, documents on computers, laptop or smartphone, messages, websites, locational evidence and voice mail messages stored on digital devices. The definition of “evidence” has been expanded to include any information given electronically, which will enable the appearance of witnesses, accused, experts and victims through electronic means.

The committee in its report said that it was brought to its attention during deliberations that the inclusion of the words “any information” within the meaning of evidence could cause serious complications in its interpretations, and that the word “information” is different from statements.

The committee has recommended that the words “any information” be deleted.

“The committee opines that inclusion of ‘any information’ along with ‘statement’ in the same line may cause complications in its interpretation. The committee, therefore, recommends that the words ‘any information’ may be deleted in this clause to avoid such complications,” it said.

Safeguarding electronic and digital evidence against tampering

The committee has also recommended the need to safeguard the authenticity of electronic and digital records acquired during investigation against tampering.

It said that Clause 57 provides for treating electronic and digital records produced from proper custody as primary evidence, but does not mention about ensuring proper chain of custody of such digital and electronic records.

“The provision of maintaining proper chain of custody has already been incorporated within the ambit of criminal laws in developed countries such as the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK).”

It recommended that that proper chain of custody needs to be maintained to avoid tampering during the handling of evidence.

“The committee is of the opinion that safeguarding the authenticity and integrity of electronic and digital records acquired during the course of investigation is crucial due to the fact that such evidences are prone to tampering,” it said.

“The committee takes into account the suggestion submitted before the committee and recommends that a provision may be inserted to mandate that all electronic and digital records acquired as evidence during the course of investigation are securely handled and processed through proper chain of custody. Appropriate provision in this regard may be made in the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.”

Drafting and cross-referencing errors

In addition, the committee has also noted a number of drafting errors in various clauses and recommended their rectifications.

It also found several cross-referencing errors in different clauses in the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill, 2023.

“The committee also undertook a detailed examination of the text of each clause and noted that the Bill contains some cross-referencing errors. The committee, therefore, recommends the ministry to rectify such errors,” it said.

The committee concluded that the changes brought in the Bill would “reflect the growing importance of digital evidence” and the need for a more comprehensive legal framework in line with 21st century technological advancements and societal changes.

"At India’s Summit for Global South, Leaders Raise Strong Concerns Over Ongoing Conflict in West Asia",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/at-indias-summit-for-global-south-leaders-raise-strong-concern-over-ongoing-conflict-in-west-asia,"Nov 18, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: The Israel-Hamas war was a common thread in the discussions at the second Voice of the Global South summit, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi referring to “new challenges” from the geopolitical crisis that have caused thousands of deaths over the last one month.

On Friday (November 17), India held the second virtual Voice of the Global South summit. The first summit was held in January this year. It was part of New Delhi’s positioning as a leader of the developing world ahead of the G-20 summit.

At the opening session for leaders, Modi noted that “we are all seeing that new challenges are emerging from events in the West Asia region”.

He reiterated that India had “condemned the heinous terrorist attack in Israel on October 7”. The Indian leader then noted that New Delhi has also called for restraint as well as dialogue and diplomacy.

“We strongly condemn the deaths of civilians in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. After talking to President Mahmoud Abbas, we have also sent humanitarian aid to the people of Palestine. It is time that the countries of the Global South speak with one voice for the greater global good,” he said.

More than 12,000 civilians have been killed in Gaza in Israel’s counter-strikes, following Hamas attack that left over 1,400 Israelis dead.

Incidentally, most of the global south had spoken rather unanimously at the United Nations General Assembly when it passed a resolution on October 27, calling for humanitarian pauses in Israel’s military operations against Hamas in Gaza. Among the global south, the only major outliers had been India and the Philippines who had abstained, while most of Asia, Africa, and Latin Africa voted yes on the resolution tabled by Jordan and the Arab League.

Later, Indian foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra told reporters that all the leaders expressed “strong concern” at the deteriorating situation in West Asia.

“Many leaders spoke, almost all the leaders, spoke about the challenges of terrorism, the need to provide humanitarian assistance, horror at the civilian casualties due to the conflict. These three were the threads that were sort of common to all the interventions,” he said at a late night media briefing.

The senior Indian diplomat also said that there had been discussion on the need to have access to sustainable credit, which did not add to the debt burden of most countries. When asked if the topic was an indictment of China’s policy, Kwatra said that no names were taken, but that there was acknowledgement on what kind of funding was not healthy.

“And everybody’s intervention essentially spoke of the need that when they access this financing for their development projects for climate crisis or for energy transitions, it should be in a manner and of a kind that does not impose a debt burden on the structural parameters of the economy. It should be more sustainable,” he added

During the session for foreign ministers, external affairs minister S. Jaishankar said that there continued to be “a resistance for a greater role for the global south in shaping solutions for the key issues of our times”.

He also mentioned that the lesson of the COVID-19 pandemic was the “the perils of dependence for basic necessities on far away geographies abilities vis-à-vis economic concentrations”. “We need to not only democratise and diversify production, but build resilient and reliable supply chains and promote local solutions. Only then can the global south secure its future,” noted Jaishankar."

The Bill, along with the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill (which seeks to replace the Indian Penal Code, 1870) and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam Bill (which seeks to replace the Indian Evidence Act, 1872), was introduced in parliament on August 11 by Union home minister Amit Shah. They were then referred to the 31-member Parliamentary Standing Committee, headed by BJP MP Brij Lal. The panel adopted its report last week.

The Wire analyses the recommendations and observations of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill.

No handcuffs for economic offences

While the Supreme Court in an order in 1980 had said that handcuffs are against human dignity, the Bill provides for its use under clause 43(3) for certain offences.

Opposition MPs in their dissent note had also flagged the return of the use of handcuffs and said that the Section was in line with the “colonial mindset of punitive control of state”.

In its report, however, the parliamentary panel has not objected to its use, except in the case of economic offences.

“The committee believes that the use of handcuffs, as outlined in Clause 43(3), is appropriately restricted to select heinous crimes, which is necessary for preventing the escape of individuals accused of serious offences and ensuring the safety of police officers and staff during arrests,” it said.

“However, the committee is of the view that ‘economic offences’ should not be included in this category. This is because the term ‘economic offences’ encompasses a wide range of offences, ranging from petty to serious, and therefore, it may not be suitable for blanket application of handcuffing in all cases falling under this category. The committee, therefore, recommends that Clause 43(3) may be suitably amended to delete the words ‘economic offences’ from the clause.”

Safeguards against misuse of electronic evidence

While the Bill advocates for the increasing utilisation of technology, the parliamentary panel report, however, cautions against electronic data usage without safeguards.

The Bill says that trials, inquiries, proceedings can be held in electronic mode, along with the production of electronic communication devices (such as mobiles, computers, etc.), for potential digital evidence for investigation, inquiry or trial.

The panel report said that “while the increased utilisation of technology offers numerous advantages, it also creates opportunities for manipulation and misuse.”

It also said that the collection and storage of electronic evidence raises “concerns about data security and the possibility of unauthorised breaches” and has called for “robust safeguards” against it.

“The committee, therefore, recommends that the adoption of electronic means for communication and trials should proceed only after the establishment of robust safeguards to ensure the secure usage and authentication of electronically available data. This will help safeguard the integrity of the justice system and ensure that justice is administered fairly and accurately,” it said.

It has also said that while enabling online/electronic FIR registration is a positive step forward in the proposed legislation, it feels that such online/electronic registration should be allowed only through modes specified by the State.

The committee also said that while the Bill provides for formal adoption of audio-visual and electronic means to undertake various processes, a clause may be inserted for facilitating audio-video recording of evidence of defence, after ensuring proper safeguards. It said that to avoid the possibility of tutoring or intimidation of witnesses, such recording should only be allowed at select government places.

Need clarity on the extended period of police custody

The panel has also sought greater clarity on the issue of the increased period of police custody, an issue that had been raised by the opposition MPs in their dissent notes. The MPs had referred to Clause 187 that allows the magistrate to increase the period of police custody beyond 15 days under certain circumstances, and said that increasing the period of police custody without proper safeguards could lead to human rights violations.

The committee report noted that Clause 187(2) stipulates a total of 15 days for police custody, to be utilised in whole or in parts at any time during the initial 40 days or 60 days out of the detention period of 60 days or 90 days, as applicable.

“However, there is a concern that this clause could be vulnerable to misuse by authorities, as it does not explicitly clarify that the custody was not taken in the first 15 days either due to the conduct of the accused or due to extraneous circumstances beyond the control of the investigating officer. The committee recommends that a suitable amendment may be brought to provide greater clarity in the interpretation of this clause,” it said.

Government must provide reasons for commuting sentences

The opposition MPs had also raised concerns about the power of the government to commute a sentence under Clause 475 of the new Bill.

The committee in its report has, however, only recommended amending Clause 475(b) to specify both a minimum and maximum sentence that can be imposed on convicts while commuting imprisonment for life to a shorter term. It has also directed that the government must provide reasons for commuting a sentence.

“To ensure that the power given to the appropriate government to commute a sentence is judiciously used and the commutation is justified, the committee recommends that appropriate reasons may be cited before commutation of a sentence,” it said."
India Urges Canada to Abide By Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-urges-canada-to-abide-by-vienna-convention-on-diplomatic-relations,"Nov 17, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India on Thursday (November 16) reiterated its call for Canada to abide by the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations after pro-Khalistan groups allegedly disturbed a camp set up by the Indian consulate in Vancouver.

The Indian consulate had set up a camp to provide life certificates to pensioners on November 12 as part of a routine exercise. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi, during a media briefing, said that the event was held successfully despite attempts by a few radical elements to cause trouble.

Days after the event, India called on Ottawa to ensure a conducive environment in line with provisions of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations so that its officials can discharge their duties without any hindrance or security concerns, the Tribune reported.

“We reiterate the need for nations to respect the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations so that our diplomats can discharge their diplomatic obligations,” Bagchi was quoted by the paper as saying.

India’s diplomatic relations with Canada had soured after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the killing of pro-Khalistan activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in September.

India strongly rejected the allegations and responded by temporarily suspending visa services to Canadian citizens and asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity.

Bagchi was also asked about an incident that occurred near Brampton on Diwali which he called an “unrest” between two groups.

“As regards to events that you alluded to near Brampton on Diwali. I think that was more in the nature of unrest between the two groups. I don’t think there has been any complaint that our consulate has received… I saw some social media reports. We also understand that the authorities there are looking into that incident,” he said.

India’s fresh call to Ottawa comes days after it urged Canada to stop the “misuse” of freedom of expression to incite violence and prevent activities of extremist groups during Canada’s review of human rights record at the UN Human Rights Council.

This call by India was presented as part of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process, under which member states of the United Nations undergo a periodic evaluation of their human rights records."
India’s PC Imports Surge to 4.5 million After Union Government U-Turn on Import Licenses,https://m.thewire.in/article/trade/indias-pc-imports-surge-to-4-5-million-after-union-government-u-turn-on-import-licenses,"Nov 17, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India’s imports of personal computers surged to a record 4.5 million units in the July to September quarter, recording an increase of 14% year-over-year (YoY) according to data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker.

According to the data released on November 16, the notebook category grew by 13.1% YoY, while the desktop category grew by 19.3%.

India’s traditional PC market includes desktops, notebooks, and workstations.

The growth comes after the Union government’s U-turn last month on its earlier plan imposing import restrictions on laptops, tablets, and certain types of computers.

The announcement on October 19, came months after the government imposed import restrictions on laptops, tablets, and certain types of computers with immediate effect, citing “security reasons” and the need to promote domestic manufacturing on August 3.

The government then had also said that those wanting to import these items would need a license starting November 1.

“The consumer segment saw strong traction in 3Q23 after a challenging past four quarters. In August, the government of India declared a mandatory requirement of import licenses for PCs from 30 October. Though this decision was later put on hold, vendors shipped significant channel inventory to avoid any risks of supply shortages or price hikes, not to mention ensuring sufficient supplies for festival season sales,” Bharath Shenoy, senior research analyst, IDC India was quoted as saying.

According to IDC data the consumer sector saw a rise of 26.3% compared to the previous year but the commercial sector remained unchanged.

In terms of personal computer companies, HP Inc. led the market with a share of 29.4% as it topped the charts in both the commercial and consumer segments with shares of 34.3% and 25.9% respectively

According to the IDC the firm’s inventory pushes and positive market sentiment helped it clock its biggest ever consumer quarter.

Lenovo came second with a share of 17% as its shipments fell 8.8% year on year. In the desktop category it fared well and witnessed year on year growth of 32.5% in the third quarter of 2023.

Dell Technologies came third with a 14.6% market share and a year-on-year growth of 3.8%. IDC said that Lenovo had not decided not to do heavy stocking, which led to some market share loss but helped maintain healthy channel inventory.

ASUS took the fourth position with a 12.5% share and achieved its most significant consumer quarter by surpassing 500,000 units in the consumer segment. According to IDC ASUS decided to do heavy stocking for festive season sales as it wanted to avoid any supply hurdles due to the import regulations.

Acer took the fifth spot with 11.6% market share despite a 20.9% year-on-year growth. IDC said that the company’s focus on online channels contributed to its most substantial consumer quarter on record. The firm pushed stocks on online channels and had its biggest consumer quarter.

Despite the increase in the consumer segment, IDC said that in the PC market a dearth of enterprise orders remains a concern.

“In the past few months, the PC market has seen a substantial channel push in the consumer segment and to some extent in the SME segment as well,” said Navkendar Singh, Associate Vice President, Devices Research, IDC India, South Asia & ANZ.

“The vendors are now focused on increasing their local assembly mix as government and education projects are expected to prefer locally assembled devices. While this might give a further boost to the government and education segments, a dearth of enterprise orders is a matter of concern as the enterprise segment is expected to decline by over 20% YoY in 2023.”"
There Is No Real Dislike for Cats in India – Art History Says as Much,https://m.thewire.in/article/books/art-history-cats-bn-goswamy-indian-cat,"Nov 17, 2023  |  B.N.

A detail from 'The Presentation of the Infant Jesus in the Temple of Jerusalem, Forty Days After His Birth,' Possibly Deccan; ca. 1610–20 [Victoria & Albert Museum, London; acc. no. I.M. 14a–1913].

This excerpt, first published on October 20, 2023, was republished on November 17, 2023, the day the author passed away.

The following is an excerpt from B.N. Goswamy’s The Indian Cat: Stories, Paintings, Poetry, and Proverbs, published by Aleph Book Company this year.

It is best to begin with a confession, I think.

Strictly speaking, I am not a cat lover. I am therefore not even entitled perhaps to put together a book on cats. But, somehow, they have stayed in my awareness for long years. When a stray one sneaked into our house once, for instance, and Apu, my son, took to her, cold and shivering as she was when she came in. He fed her, held on to her, gave her a name – Katja it was if I remember aright – and, after returning from school, he would talk to her first, ahead of anyone else at home. It was a few years before we shifted home and she decided against moving. As simple as that.

Then, years later, I had a faintly bristly encounter with a whole pride of cats at the home of a dear friend in Zurich: Ursula Dohrn. She loved cats, had many of them, and they had all become members of her family. Whenever I went to visit her, they were there, naturally and everywhere: if one was occupying the first seat on a sofa, another was lurking under the centre table, and yet another clambering onto her shoulder sometimes. For me it was not easy and, almost complainingly, I once told Ursula during a visit how hard it was to find a quiet moment with her without the cats participating in the conversation, nodding approval, or saying something in a whispered purr to her. Quickly, in a tone of mock-admonishment, Ursula shot back. ‘You are an art historian, Brijinder, are you not?’

‘I am; or so I think,’ I replied.

‘Then, you should love cats: all art historians do.’

This unsettled me a bit, but she went on. ‘Annemarie Schimmel does: she has in fact even written more than one book on them.’ I knew and held Professor Schimmel in great regard, but this fact I was not aware of.

Even as I was registering it, Ursula came up

with another name, another highly regarded art historian – Stella Kramrisch. ‘She is a cat lover, is she not?’ So she was, I knew, for I had seen a whole lot of them around her whenever I visited her, first in her Paoli home, and later in her apartment in the heart of Philadelphia.

These firm statements showed me my place as far as Ursula’s cats went. It wasn’t over yet, however. For, the next day, a book was delivered to my apartment: a paperback edition of Annemarie Schimmel’s work – much celebrated I was to learn – in German: Die Orientalische Katze, with the subtitle: Mysticism and Poetry of the Orient. Sent obviously by Ursula, but without a note. She was driving a point home.

I felt informed, but, as an art historian, not particularly persuaded. Or obligated. It was a bit later that I became involved: not so much with cats as with the idea of cats.

A great Sanskrit scholar, C. Sivaramamurti, then director of the National Museum in Delhi, happened to bring up two terms in the course of a conversation that had the Sanskrit word for cats – marjara – built into them: marjara-nyaya and marjara – vrata . There was talk, in the context of Vaishnava bhakti or devotion, about different ways through which a devotee approaches his ishta deity. There are many nyayas – methods or theories – but the two most often cited are markata – nyaya and marjara – nyaya .

The former refers to how the young one of a monkey – markata in Sanskrit – approaches God, and the latter to how the young one of a cat – marjara – does. Briefly put, ‘markata-nyaya refers to the behaviour of a baby monkey, who clings tightly to its mother wherever she goes. The mother monkey’s arms are occupied as she leaps from tree to tree; she does not hold on to the baby; but as long as the baby holds firmly to her, it arrives safely’.

Whereas ‘marjara-nyaya refers to the behaviour of kittens, who are likely to wander. The mother cat picks them up by the scruff of the neck and carries them wherever she wants them to be. The kitten is passive; she makes no effort but arrives safely by surrendering to the mother’s protective grasp.’ It is up to the devotee, then, to choose: to keep making an effort to cling for succour to his deity, or to leave everything to the deity, trusting him and surrendering to him completely. No recommendation is made, no preference indicated.

Never having heard of any of this before, I was fascinated. But even more fascinating for me was the use of the term marjara-vrata. In common usage it stands simply for ‘a cat-like observance’, but the term is not neutral. It really has come to stand for ‘concealing one’s malice or evil designs under the garb of piety or virtue’.

It is an accusation that one person might fling at his rival while calling him a ‘cheat’, or a ‘hypocrite’. In an episode in that ancient epic of ours, the Mahabharata, Duryodhana charges even the noble Yudhishthira with observing the marjara-vrata, not once, but repeatedly.

Clearly, the cat had come to stand for ‘hypocrisy’ – ‘ye gods, that person whose standard of righteousness is always up, but whose sins are always concealed’ – and the opprobrium seems to have endured over a very long time: cleverness, hypocrisy, avarice, inscrutability, thievery.

Interestingly enough, however, in our land at the same time there is no real dislike for cats. There are superstitions around her figure, for certain, and stories go on being repeated.

But no fatwas have been passed; no papal bulls issued. Great poets like Mir and Ghalib loved their cats to distraction; the poet Jibanananda Das saw himself in a cat that went here and there, following the Sun; Vikram Seth saw her as full of mischief and cleverness but no evil. In fact, on a daily basis, the feline is ‘addressed’ almost with affection. She is ‘maano’, ‘maaoon’, ‘mausi’ (mother’s sister), ‘pisshi’, ‘biloongari’, if one goes by usage, at least in the northern parts of our land.

It is somewhere out of these memories and stray thoughts and scattered observations – whether it was mock-admonishment that I received as an art historian, seductive and long-buried snippets that reading about cats yielded, or the fact that my son adopted recently two cats – that the present work has emerged. Of course, the reader is entitled to ask: ‘So?’ But he will at least find inside absorbing tales and images and poetry and proverbs, that I gathered together. All on cats. Indian cats.

A word of explanation to end with, however. Inadvertently, because one is so used to it in one’s own life, the cat in my account is always taken to be a female. Lacking in logic as this is, the gender is open to change. Second word: the book is confined, strictly confined, to cats in India – domestic cats – not because they are unique, but because cats elsewhere – and they are everywhere – have their own histories, their own tales, their own place in life.

"In Two Months, India Transitioned from Aspiring Global South Leader to Plain US Ally",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/in-two-months-india-transitioned-from-aspiring-global-south-leader-to-plain-us-ally,"Nov 17, 2023  |  M.K. Bhadrakumar","If the US is a declining power and China’s rise inevitable in the Indo-Pacific; if Russia regards itself as a global power and is determined to bury the US-dominated rules-based order; if the defeat of the US and NATO in the Ukraine war has become a fait accompli; if Canada was encouraged by the US to fret and fume over alleged Indian involvement in Nijjar’s killing; if Israel’s bloodbath in Gaza is actually genocide — well, India’s policymakers haven’t heard any of this. That is the message coming out of the US-Indian 2+2 foreign and defence ministers meeting in New Delhi on November 10.

The big picture is that after audaciously claiming the mantle of leadership of the Global South as recently as in September, in a span of over two months, India is gliding over to the American camp as the US’ indispensable ally, even aspiring to be a “global defence hub”, with the help of the Pentagon.

Some takeaways of the 2+2 meeting:

Sharing technology relating to “maritime challenges, including in the undersea domain”;

Co-development and co-production of ground mobility systems;

India to undertake US aircraft maintenance and mid-voyage repair of US naval vessels;

to undertake US aircraft maintenance and mid-voyage repair of US naval vessels; US investment in India ’s maintenance, repair and overhaul of US aircraft and UAVs;

’s maintenance, repair and overhaul of US aircraft and UAVs; Finalisation of a Security of Supply Arrangement, which would deepen the integration of defence industrial ecosystems and strengthen supply chain resilience;

Creation of new liaison positions between the two armed forces further to India ’s full membership of the multinational Combined Maritime Forces, headquartered in Bahrain;

’s full membership of the multinational Combined Maritime Forces, headquartered in Bahrain; Maximisation of the scope of the Logistics and Exchange Memorandum Agreement, and identify steps to enhance the reach of the US naval vessels to Indian bases.

No doubt, the above is only the tip of the iceberg, while this extraordinary transition in Indian policies will largely remain behind closed-doors. The US seems supremely confident that India is ready to enter into an exclusive alliance, something that New Delhi never sought with any big power. What is the offer that the Biden Administration has made to India that the latter cannot refuse?

Clearly, such a massive shift in India’s military policies needs to be correlated with the fundamental postulates of foreign policy. But call it “bipartisan consensus” or whatever, India’s main Opposition party apparently doesn’t care. This is not surprising. The shift is actually about a nascent India-US alliance to counter China — and that is a policy front where it is difficult to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

Russia and China understand that Indian foreign policy is transitioning, but they pretend not to notice. At any rate, their capacity to leverage Indian policies has dramatically shrunk — Moscow’s in particular.

India is not ecstatic about growing multipolarity. It is a beneficiary of the “rules-based order” and feels far more comfortable with a bipolar world in which the US is pre-eminent, developing its national power with China’s hegemonic instincts in check. Today, India’s willingness to align with the US is more evident than ever before. The animus against China’s rise was palpable at the 2+2 meeting. India has cast away any residual pretensions and is shifting toward an openly adversarial relationship with China. The Quad has become an important locomotive. To be sure, a Chinese response can be expected.

This is possible because Delhi feels reasonably assured that Washington’s Indo-Pacific focus remains intact under the Biden administration, despite growing engagement with China ― Xi Jinping’s first trip to the US in five years, and a summit meeting with President Biden to make the Sino-American relationship more predictable.

The three regional issues that figured prominently at the 2+2 were Afghanistan, Ukraine and the Palestine-Israel conflict. The Joint Statement devoted a separate paragraph subtitled Afghanistan, which implicitly accused the Taliban of not adhering to their “commitment to prevent any group or individual from using the territory of Afghanistan to threaten the security of any country.” It pointedly recalls UNSC Resolution 2593 (2021), which specifically “demands that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or finance terrorist attacks.”

Delhi is making a radical departure from its attempts to constructively engage with the Taliban rulers. One reason could be intelligence inputs to the effect that Afghanistan is once again becoming a revolving door for international terrorist groups.

Also, both the US and India are exasperated about the Taliban’s growing proximity with China and the spectre of Afghanistan turning into a hub of the Belt and Road Initiative. Beijing’s plan to build a road connecting Afghanistan via Wakhan Corridor is a game-changer in geo-strategy. The security of Xinjiang is a matter of incessant interest to Delhi.

The 2+2 joint statement signals a renewed US-Indian convergence on Afghanistan. How far this would translate into proactive moves is a moot point. Notably, the US and its allies are also exploiting Russia’s preoccupations with the conflict in Ukraine to double down on their post-Cold War strategy to roll back Russian influence in Afghanistan. Moscow senses that it is losing ground in its backyard.

On Ukraine and the Palestine-Israel conflict, the US and Indian sides have harmonised their positions. Delhi is shedding its strategic ambivalence and moving towards the US position. This comes out in what the joint statement says, and what it doesn’t. On Ukraine, Russia’s attritional war has “consequences predominantly affecting the global South.” This apart, Moscow can learn to live with the 2+2 formulation on the Ukraine war.

As regards the West Asian situation, the joint statement voices vehement support for Israel’s fight against “terrorism”. Here, again, India refuses to call out Hamas. Nor is India endorsing Israel’s war on Hamas, leave alone pre-judge its chances of success. Most important, the joint statement omits any reference to Israel’s so-called “right to self-defence”, a mantra that is constantly on Biden’s lips.

India cannot possibly call the Gaza war an act of “self defence” when Israel has unleashed such a brutal military operation against hapless civilians and razed Gaza City to the ground. It’s reminiscent of the joint British-American aerial bombing attack on Dresden during World War II, which killed over 25,000 German people on the night of March 9-10, 1945.

Perhaps all these diplomatic peregrinations through the Valley of Death could be better understood against the backdrop of the intense back-channel dealings involving the Hamas leadership in regional capitals, in which the Biden administration would have high stakes and is a participant.

"By Coming to the Aid of Myanmar Soldiers, India Signals Willingness to Support the Junta",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/by-coming-to-the-aid-of-myanmar-soldiers-india-signals-willingness-to-support-the-junta,"Nov 16, 2023  |  Nirupama Subramanian","India came to the unexpected aid of the Myanmar military earlier this week, on the night of November 12, when it allowed 46 soldiers of the Burmese junta to enter neighbouring Mizoram. The Myanmarese soldiers were trying to escape from Chin pro-democracy militias who overran their camps in Myanmar’s Chin state, on the other side of the Mizoram border.

The unusual SOS request from the Myanmarese junta first came to the Indian embassy in Naypidaw, which in turn conveyed the urgency of the request to Delhi.

Soon after, instructions went out from New Delhi to security officials in the North-East to allow the Myanmarese soldiers to enter Mizoram.

The Mizoram state police took charge of the soldiers early Monday morning. One day later, they were airlifted to the Moreh border in Manipur. From Moreh, 39 soldiers were sent across, via the established border crossing point, to Tamu on the Myanmar side. Seven more soldiers were expected to return on Wednesday.

This is perhaps the first time that India has rescued soldiers of another country’s army fleeing the fighting on their own soil. It signals New Delhi’s increasing willingness to collaborate with the military regime in Myanmar in the protection of its own national interest despite the junta’s shaky hold on the country.

Coming on the heels of the Myanmar military’s defeat in the Shan state on the country’s north-east border with China, the incident is a further embarrassment to the junta, which has been struggling to establish its writ since seizing power in a coup in 2021.

It has certainly not been easy. Armed pro-democracy militias, called the People’s Defence Forces (PDF), have taken back large parts of the country from the Myanmar military. The PDF has declared its allegiance to the National Unity Government, which handsomely won the February 2021 election, which was soon after voided by the military.

This is the second time this year that fighting between the junta and pro-democracy forces in Myanmar has spilled over into India. In January, the junta bombed the pro-democracy Chin National Front (CNF) headquarters called Camp Victoria, located on the border with Champhai in Mizoram.

Shrapnel fell into the Tiau river that flows between the two countries forming a natural boundary, and destroyed a vehicle, sending people in the area fleeing.

This time, the fighting claimed one life and injured another person in a Chin refugee camp inside Mizoram close to the border. The camp was hit by shrapnel.

India has felt the impact of the Myanmar military coup in other ways too. More than 40,000 Chin refugees from Myanmar have taken refuge in Mizoram since the February 2021 coup.

This time, the fighting triggered a fresh influx of civilian refugees into Mizoram to save themselves from getting caught in the crossfire.

The latest episode in Indian-Myanmar military collaboration began late Sunday (November 12), when Chin Defence Forces and other pro-democracy groups attacked two military posts in Rehkhawdar town in Chin state to wrest it from the junta. The CDF captured the town.

Rehkhawdar is located opposite Zokhawthar in Mizoram’s Champhai district.

As fighting raged through Sunday night, Zokhawthar, which already hosts some 5,000 Chin refugees, took in another batch of 4,000 civilians. Thousands of civilian refugees crossed the Tiau river and came into Mizoram to escape the fighting, according to Vanlalchanna, chairman of the Myanmar Refugees Relief Committee of Mizoram.

“The two places are very close. Some are staying in camps, some are staying in homes of people they know,” said Vanlalchanna, whose organisation is helping with food rations and other arrangements for the refugees.

According to Indian security sources, the soldiers in Rehkhawdar were completely cut off on the Myanmar side, and had no way of finding their way back to safety. So they got in touch with Indian security forces.

“In our border security management, there is a lot of cooperation and understanding between security forces on both sides. So they felt they could reach out to the Indian side for help,” an Indian security official told Awaaz South Asia.

In Mizoram, where the rescued soldiers spent a night in Zorkhwathar police station, resentment against the Myanmar Army is high. That’s because Chin refugees bring first-hand accounts of aerial bombing and shelling by the Myanmar military, which has also burnt down entire villages.

Speaking from Zorkhawthar, Ramtharnghaka, president of the local chapter of the Young Mizo Association, an NGO that has been actively supporting the refugees, said the people of the area had gathered outside the police station where the soldiers were being kept and had demanded “to see the faces of the soldiers”.

“But the police told them that was not possible, and the people dispersed obediently,” he said.

On Tuesday, two helicopters landed in Hnalan village in Mizoram, picked up the Myanmarese soldiers in two batches each and evacuated them to the Manipuri town of Moreh, from where they were sent back by road across to Tamu in Myanmar.

With the fighting subsiding, for now, some of the civilian refugees have gone back too, said Vanlalchanna.

But there is no telling when India will again be drawn into the arc of Myanmar’s instability. So far India has signalled that it will work with the junta to secure its own interests. India is also keenly aware that Myanmar’s other neighbours, especially China, keep a close watch on developments in the country.

Last month, Deputy National Security Adviser Vikram Misri was in Naypidaw along with representatives from Thailand and China, for the anniversary commemoration of a 2015 ceasefire agreement with ethnic armed organisations.

But the 2021 military coup frayed the ceasefire and it is dead in all but name. The Myanmar military’s attempts to revive this truce and separate the ethnic armed organisations from the People’s Defence Forces have so far failed.

In October 2015, eight ethnic armed groups signed the National Ceasefire Agreement. In February 2018, two more ethnic rebel groups joined the cease-fire brokered by Aung San Suu Kyi’s civilian government, bringing the total number of signatories to 10.

But three pro-democracy groups that signed the truce agreement are now allied with the PDF, including the Chin National Front, which did not attend last month’s anniversary event.

The Arakkan Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army which also signed the ceasefire are part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance that delivered a crushing blow to the junta in Shan state on China’s border. Myanmar’s military defeat in Chin state on India’s Mizoram border underlines the failure of the ceasefire.

In the face of the Myanmar military’s weakening hold, India may soon have to take a call on whether it can put all its eggs in that basket. Or, whether it should start reaching out more proactively than it has done so far to the National Unity Government.

"After Israel’s Gaza Hospital Operation, India Cites Importance of International Humanitarian Law",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/israel-gaza-hospital-india-humanitarian-law,"Nov 17, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","Large areas of the Gaza Strip have been destroyed by missile strikes. Photo: WHO

New Delhi: A day after Israeli military took control over Gaza’s largest hospital, India restated its call for upholding international humanitarian law, but refrained from mentioning a ceasefire once again.

In response to a question about New Delhi’s stance on Israeli troops conducting an operation at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza city, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi emphasised that India consistently highlights the importance of adhering to international law.

“The issue is not about one facility or a specific facility. India has always underlined the need for civilian casualties to be avoided, for humanitarian law to be observed, and to encourage any efforts to provide humanitarian relief to those caught in the conflict,” he said.

Israel invaded Gaza more than three weeks ago after Hamas launched a terror attack, killing more than 1400 Israeli citizens and taking about 220 hostages. More than 11,000 people have been killed in Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.

Israel has claimed that Al-Shifa hospital is an “operational centre” for Hamas and that it sits atop a network of tunnels. The New York Times noted that Israel had “yet to present much evidence supporting that claim to the public”.

He added that India has “on the larger issue” talked about “de-escalate the situation” and expressed concern at the increasing civilian toll. “We had also talked about how India had sent 38 tonnes of humanitarian relief materials. We are looking to send more assistance,” he said.

He also reiterated India’s condemnation of attack by Hamas on Israel. “We had also strongly condemned the horrific terrorist attack on October 7 and our zero tolerance for terrorism and the need for immediate and unconditional release of the hostages,” said Bagchi.

India’s initial response to the October 7 attack had been for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to express “solidarity with Israel”. It was only a week later that India reiterated that its traditional support for the Palestinian cause after the explosion at Al-Ahli hospital.

India had abstained on the UN general assembly resolution that called for “humanitarian pauses” to deliver food, fuel and water supplies to Gaza. New Delhi has, so far, not explicitly supported any call for a ceasefire or a humanitarian pause."
The Israeli Onslaught on Palestine Is a Boost to Indian Islamophobia,https://m.thewire.in/article/communalism/israeli-onslaught-on-palestine-is-a-boost-to-indian-islamophobia,"Nov 16, 2023  |  Ram Puniyani","The insane attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7 has been followed by crimes against humanity by the Zionist state of Israel, which has attacked Palestinian hospitals, refugee camps and other civilian targets, causing the death of over 11,000 civilians, a large number of them children. India jumped to support Israel, along with the Western powers. Leaders of the US and UK flew to Israel to extend their support. The UN resolution for a ceasefire was opposed by some Western powers and shamefully, India abstained. True, India sent token humanitarian aid to Palestine. Various columnists in India commented on the ghastly phenomenon. Most of them blamed the tragedy on Hamas, many called it a jihadi terrorist organisation, and characterised their unabashed support of Israel as ‘zero tolerance’ of terrorism.

The “godi” media is glorifying Israel’s actions and condemning the ‘terrorist’ Hamas. Many pro-Palestine demonstrations were held in India, but police in Delhi, UP and even Opposition-ruled Bengaluru and Kolkata have denied permission to protests against Israel’s aggression. In UP, the chief minister said no opposition to the Indian government’s official position would be permitted. In contrast, the Western world saw a plethora of protests in which, interestingly, many Jews have been participating.

Indian social media is full of opposition to the Hamas attack and is presenting Israel as a victim of Hamas. Yet, since the day of the Hamas attack on October 7, social media has seen more and more Islamophobic posts, guided by the BJP’s IT cell. The Palestinian cause is presented as Islamist, and so we must support Israel. There seems to be total conflation of the already prevailing domestic Islamophobia in India with Israel’s war against the people of Gaza.

The most scathing Islamophobic posts, since the war began, have come from India. The peak of this phenomenon, equating Hamas with Palestine and presenting it as a terrorist jihadi organisation, was witnessed in IIT-Bombay. Here, a humanities faculty member outlined the history of Palestine and Israel and the formation of Hamas in a class. In the same department, Sudhanva Deshpande, noted cultural worker from the Jan Natya Manch, showed a documentary and outlined the resistance to the Israeli occupation in Palestine.

According to the Times of India (on November 12, 2023), students affiliated to the RSS-backed Vivek Vichar Manch protested and demanded the suspension of the faculty member. VVM students took out a procession along with people from outside the campus and gave the call for ‘goli maro (shoot them)’. They filed a complaint against the faculty member and Deshpande for eulogising “terrorists” and demanded a probe by central agencies.

Apart from the question of academic freedom, this raises many others. How is the Israeli occupation and the Palestinian resistance being seen? It is heartening that India has voted for the UN resolution against Israel’s attempt to make settlements in Gaza. The ongoing aggression in Gaza by Israel has to be seen in context. As UN Secretary General António Guterres said, “Hamas has not come from a vacuum.”

Noam Chomsky says, “An old man in Gaza held a placard that read: ‘You take my water, burn my olive trees, destroy my house, take my job, steal my land, imprison my father, kill my mother, bombard my country, starve us all, humiliate us all, but I am to blame: I shot a rocket back.’”

The blockade of Gaza has lasted 16 years and the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza has lasted 56 years; the dispossession of Palestinians of their lands and homes began with the establishment of Israel, an ethno-supremacist state, in 1948.

Also read: Unpacking the Hindutva Embrace of Israel

The resistance in Palestine has gone through various phases. Black September killed Israeli athletes in the Munich Olympics in 1972, after 14 lakh Palestinians were made refugees. Yasser Arafat also was doomed to failure as the Western powers tried to impose humiliating conditions on the Palestinians. Hamas is not the leadership of choice, for sure, but what is the way for the democratic expression of resistance when Gaza has been treated as an open prison by Israel? Israel has violated most of the UN resolutions seeking peace and justice. It is the aggressive occupier now eying the offshore gas reserves in Gaza, valued at around $64 billion. Israel has struck deals with US and European companies to become an exporter of energy.

But the ‘common sense’ being promoted in India compares Hamas to the jihadi terrorism which culminated in the formation of Al Qaeda, Taliban and IS. This is supposed to be ‘Islamic terrorism’, which is the biggest concoction in recent history.

That the US promoted fundamentalist groups, trained Muslim youth in Pakistan’s madrasas and armed them is not a secret. In an interview, Hillary Clinton had stated that they trained the Mujahideen to go after Russians in Afghanistan. In his book Good Muslim, Bad Muslim (Harmony, 2003), based on CIA papers, Mahmood Mamdani tells us that America spent $8,000 million and provided 7,000 tons of armaments to train the Mujahideen and Al Qaeda. After 9/11 US media coined the phrase ‘Islamic terrorism’, Islamophobia was the main thrust of the US propaganda machine, which was picked up by the global media. In India, it became an add-on to the prevailing anti-Muslim ‘communal common sense’ which came to rule the godi media, social media and corporate-controlled TV channels, aided by word-of-mouth propaganda by Hindu majoritarian groups.

This is what has led to the current dismal situation, where in an academic institution an invited talk on the history of the formation of Israel, its occupation of Palestine and its designs on gas reserves is seen as promoting terrorism! Israel is probably the only modern example of a nation formed by immigrants who gradually displaced the mass of humanity living in the region, who are not permitted any democratic expressions of resistance. And when Hamas offers a ferocious attack, it’s an excuse to pounce upon the whole nation of Palestine with barbaric force!

Watch | ‘I’m Extremely Confident We’ll Have a Good FTA With India’: UK Deputy Foreign Secretary,https://m.thewire.in/article/video/im-extremely-confident-well-have-a-good-fta-with-india-uk-dy-foreign-secy-says,"Nov 16, 2023  |  Karan Thapar","New Delhi: In an interview to discuss the consequences and implications of the appointment of David Cameron, a former British Prime Minister, as the new British foreign secretary, Britain’s deputy foreign secretary and one of the Conservative Party’s MPs of longest standing, has said that he is “extremely confident” that India and Britain will be able to agree upon a good Free Trade Agreement (FTA).

However, he was reluctant to say whether it would happen before India’s elections in May 2024.

In a 12-minute interview to Karan Thapar for The Wire, Andrew Mitchell, who earlier served as secretary of state for international development, said the criticisms of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak levelled by Suella Braverman, former home secretary, in her resignation letter were not a matter of concern.

He said such emotional outbursts need to be understood for what they are.

In her resignation letter, Braverman accused Sunak of being “uncertain, weak and lacking in the qualities of leadership that this country needs”.

She added: “Your plan is not working. We have endured record election defeats. Your resets have failed … you need to change course urgently.”

In the interview, Andrew Mitchell explained why the appointment of David Cameron as foreign secretary is the right one at this moment of time and insisted that Cameron, a former prime minister, who is perhaps internationally better known than Sunak, would not overshadow Sunak.

Andrew Mitchell also answered questions about comments in the BBC and the Financial Times that the Cameron appointment is ‘the last gasp of a party that is out of ideas’ and is like rearranging chairs on the deck of the Titanic.

He also answered questions about the alleged baggage Cameron brings to office, i.e. his China policy and allegations that he indulged in wrongful lobbying during the last few years.

Finally, there’s a section of the interview, right at the end, where Mitchell talks about the language he used as the new deputy foreign secretary whilst speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday regarding the Hamas-Israel war.

Mitchell spoke of the “appalling loss of life”. He said “every civilian death is heartbreaking”, that it is “impossible to comprehend the pain and loss innocent Palestinians are endearing” and that “too many civilians are losing their lives”.

Mitchell was asked if this is new language that reflects a significant shift in the attitude of the British government to the Hamas-Israel war. I will leave you to see the interview to hear Mitchell’s answers."
Subrata Roy Foretold New India’s New Crony Capitalism,https://m.thewire.in/article/business/subrata-roy-foretold-new-indias-new-crony-capitalism,"Nov 16, 2023  |  Harish Khare","The death of Subrata Roy of the Sahara Group provides a much-needed occasion to meditate on the inseparability of the business community and the political class in modern India. Saharashri, as Roy called himself, came to personify a key facet of our political economy: that money power can thrive and prosper only if friendly ‘political power’ is available.

Recall the closing days of Shining India. It is February 2004. The saffron crowd had convinced itself that it was coming back to power for another five years in a few months. And Saharashri had decided to use the occasion of the weddings of both his sons to showcase his connectivity with political players of all hues.

Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee travelled in an Air Force plane to Lucknow for the Sahara wedding; deputy prime minister, L.K. Advani was not one to sit out; many central ministers like Murli Manohar Joshi and Rajnath Singh felt obliged to honour the invite; even the vice president of India, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, unmindful of the protocol and dignity of his high office, allowed himself to be persuaded to attend; chief ministers like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Laloo Prasad came; and, so did Congress leaders like Digvijay Singh, Ahmed Patel and Murli Deora. Only two leaders of some consequence, Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh chose not to put in an appearance (despite many entreaties and pleadings).

Only a few months earlier, Vajpayee had warned against the possibility of ‘loktantra’ degenerating into a ‘dhantantra.’ But the Saharashri had managed to stage an intimate moment in the uncertain relationship between the business/industrial class and the political crowd; neither side felt apologetic about the company it was keeping. But that evening was to become a reminder of how money power often became dependent upon the vicissitudes of a changing political landscape. From the pinnacle of his fame and respectability in February 2004, the ‘entrepreneur’ who died in a Mumbai hospital ended up a forgotten figure because the political economy chessboard got reset and new political winners came in with their own business friends and financiers.

Admittedly, the business community has a legitimate stake in how society gets organised and how it is governed. The Indian business community, from the very beginning, has sought a voice for itself in shaping the nation’s collective future. As early as January 1945, even before India became independent, eight business leaders – J.R.D. Tata, G.D. Birla, Sir Ardeshir Rustomjee Dalal, Sir Purshottamdas Thakurdas, Ardeshir Darabshaw, Lala Shri Ram, Kasturbhai Lalbhai and Dr. John Mathai – had proposed what came to be known as the Bombay Plan, a blueprint for economic development.

The post-Independence leadership, awash as it was in the legitimacy of a mass freedom struggle, did not much care for the Bombay Planners’ advice ( though John Mathai did get inducted very early in Nehru’s cabinet as finance minister). The Bombay Plan crowd liked the fact that the state’s economic intervention created infrastructure they were not capable of generating but they were not overly amused by Nehru’s attempt to build an egalitarian social order, with ‘socialistic’ content. Of course, the business groups were savvy enough to rejig their resources and prejudices to the politicians’ need for funds. The business community was pragmatic enough to recognise, if not respect, the sanctity of democratic mandates.

The 1971 Lok Sabha election (post-bank nationalisation and the abolition of privy purses) was perhaps the only time when the business leaders felt agitated enough to openly cross swords with sections of the political class. Industrialists like K.K. Birla and Naval Tata entered the electoral arena against Indira Gandhi’s Congress. Once again, they adjusted to political realities; and the Indira Gandhi regime, on its part, did not try to carry out any kind of vendetta against recalcitrant industrialists. Soon the various chambers of commerce were ordering the second and revised edition of the book of protocol of crony capitalism.

In the following two decades – before Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh unleashed India’s ‘animal spirits’ – the political leaders’ need and appetite for funds (for party and personal coffers) acquired a definite momentum and a certain grudging acceptability. The Dhirubhai Syndrome was to get consecrated.

In 1991, Corporate India came of age. The politicians not only vacated the economy’s ‘commanding heights’ but they also stepped down from their high moral perch. The desi seths were now joined by unscrupulous global ‘investors’ in creating new political players with needs and greed. Governmental ‘stability’ had to be orchestrated. Businessmen were needed with whom the politicians’ ill-gotten funds could be parked. And, a political leader’s association with shady businessman was not looked down upon because governmental ‘stability’ had to be purchased. The whole business of electoral democracy became exponentially expensive.

The new nexus was dissected insightfully by Raghuram Rajan: “So the circle is complete. The crooked politician needs the businessman to provide the funds that allow him to supply patronage to the poor and fight elections. The corrupt businessman needs the crooked politician to get public resources and contracts cheaply. And the politician needs the votes of the poor and the under-privileged. Every constituency is to the other in a cycle of dependency.”

Saharashri would have recognised the ‘cycle of dependency’ that Raghuram Rajan was talking about. Just as he would recognise that even in ‘New India’ that cycle remains not only unbroken but has been refined and almost institutionalised. Crony capitalism now goes by a new name called ‘Vikas.’

"Due to Record High Oil Purchases, Russia Emerges as India's Second Largest Source of Imports",https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/russia-emerges-as-indias-second-largest-source-of-imports-as-oil-purchases-reach-record-high,"Nov 16, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: Russia has been India’s second largest source of imports for the last seven months in the current financial year due to increased oil purchases from Moscow, Economic Times reported citing government data.

This is a marked difference from the situation that had existed during the same period last year. Before Russia, it was the United Arab Emirates which was in second place. The UAE is now India’s third largest source of imports. Meanwhile, China continues to be in the top spot.

The five largest exporters to India currently are China, Russia, the United Emirates, the United States, and Saudi Arabia.

Russia’s exports to India shot up from $ 22.13 billion during April-October in fiscal 2023 to $36.27 during the same period in the current financial year. India’s imports from Russia had risen by about 67% to $ 30.42 billion during the April-September period this fiscal on higher shipments of crude oil and fertiliser, according to the commerce ministry data.

Meanwhile, China’s exports to India remained almost the same during the same period (April-October 2023), with a marginal decrease, from $ 60.26 billion to $ 60.02 billion. On the other hand, UAE’s exports to India fell from $ 31.67 billion to $ 24.91 billion in the same period.

Meanwhile, India’s trade deficit is at a record high of $31.46 billion as imports have shot up by 12.3%. The trade deficit widened to $31.46 billion last month, much higher than economists’ expectation of $20.50 billion. The expectation was as measured earlier by a Reuters poll.

The top five India export destinations are the US, UAE, Netherlands, China, and the UK, which have remained unchanged since the last fiscal."
"India’s Trade Deficit at Record High of $31.46 Billion, Imports Shoot Up by 12.3%",https://m.thewire.in/article/trade/indias-trade-deficit-at-record-high-of-31-46-billion-imports-shoot-up-by-12-3,"Nov 16, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India’s merchandise trade deficit in October has shot up to record levels.

This was unveiled by union government officials yesterday, reports Reuters. The trade deficit widened to $31.46 billion last month, much higher than economists’ expectation of $20.50 billion. The expectation was as measured earlier by a Reuters poll.

Merchandise exports were at $33.57 billion. India’s imports zoomed up to $65.03 billion, compared with exports of $31.60 billion and imports of $57.91 billion in October last year, as per government data.

Livemint cites a commerce ministry official as saying that gold imports rose by 95% on an annual basis during October, which led to the ballooning of the trade deficit. In October gold imports totalled $7.23 billion, Reuters had reported. While Diwali and the ‘festival season’ is being cited as the reason for the demand for gold surging, demand for the yellow metal is also an expression of economic sentiment being subdued, as people prefer bullion to other financial instruments.

Imports shoot up, but government says ‘green shoots stabilising’

Imports rose at the fastest pace (12.3%) in 13 months to $65.03 billion, far outpacing the growth in merchandise exports, (6.2%) in 11 months to $33.6 billion in October.

The government wants the focus to stay on rising exports alone, and on blaming international headwinds, but the story of Indian exports has been one of concern.

Business Standard cited the commerce secretary, Sunil Barthwal as saying the government believed that the October data was a signal towards the “stabilising” of green shoots. “The greenshoots that we have talked about during the August data are now stabilising (and) we are hopeful that we will be crossing last year’s high figures,” Barthwal is reported as saying.

Atmanirbhar?

The Atmanirbhar slogan of the government of India notwithstanding, in the last financial year, trade with China has also zoomed, imports, mainly, though US is the largest trading partner. As The Wire reported in April 2023, according to provisional data from the commerce ministry, India’s exports to China dipped by about 28% to $15.32 billion in 2022-23, while imports rose by 4.16% to $98.51 billion in the last fiscal. The trade gap widened to a record high of $83.2 billion in FY23 as against $72.91 billion in 2021-22.

Due to plummeting exports, India’s bilateral trade with China showed a minor dip of about 1.5% to $113.83 billion as against $115.42 billion in 2021-22. This meant that the US emerged as India’s biggest trading partner in FY23 with a bilateral trade of $128.55 billion, as per the provisional data.

As per The Hindu, during the April-October period of this fiscal year, exports contracted by 7% to $244.89 billion. Imports during the seven-month period fell by 8.95% to $391.96 billion."
"India Slides Sharply on Global Talent Competitiveness Index, Worst Among the BRICS Group",https://m.thewire.in/article/business/india-slides-sharply-on-global-talent-competitiveness-index-worst-among-the-brics-group,"Nov 15, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","The Global Talent Competitiveness Index has seen India fall sharply down from rank 83 ten years ago to rank 103 in its latest report out earlier this month.

A total of 134 countries have been ranked and presently, India finds itself sandwiched between Algeria (a rank higher at 102) and Gautemala (at rank 104). All three are classified as lower- middle income countries. Among other countries ranking better than India are Rwanda, Paraguay, Tunisia, Namibia, Bolivia, Ghana, El Salvador, Gambia, Kenya, Morocco and Eswatini.

India is well below the median score of the countries evaluated.

Developed by prestigious chain of business schools INSEAD, the index measures “how countries and cities grow, attract and retain talent.” It says that it “provides a unique resource for decision makers to understand the global talent competitiveness picture and develop strategies to boost their economies.” The index uses two sub-indices – input and output. The input measures regulatory and business environments, as well as steps being taken to foster talent and retain it. The output side evaluates the quality of talent.

In a steep fall that must concern India, with the government often citing scores on certain business indices, ‘Ease of Doing Business’ and even the controversial World Bank-led ‘Doing Business’ scores to make its case. The World Bank Report on ‘Doing Business’ was dropped due to irregularities in which it was measured.

India’s performance in the Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI) is the worst amongst that of the BRICS countries.

China remains at the top of the BRICS group of countries at rank 40, Russia is at 52, South Africa at 68 and Brazil is ranked at 69.

The report (page 36) notes that India “remains the lowest-ranked BRICS member at 103rd. In the years to 2020, India saw its talent competitiveness increase, but it has regressed in each of the three years since. A major reason for this fall in GTCI rankings is a slump in business sentiment, which has had a detrimental effect on the ability to ‘Attract talent’ (now ranked 132nd of 134)—whether that is talent from overseas (127th in External Openness sub-pillar) or from within the country (129th in Internal Openness)”.

The report also refers to “an increased skills mismatch, and a greater difficulty in finding skilled employees, pushing India to 121st in both the ‘Employability’ sub-pillar and the ‘Vocational and Technical Skills’ pillar.” The report does record “Global Knowledge Skills, the second of the Output-related pillars, is India’s best-performing area, where innovation and software development are driving its 69th position in the Talent Impact sub-pillar.”

As per the report, other emerging countries have shown improvements on this index, with China, Indonesia and Mexico being cited for special mention. “Several of the largest emerging economies are among the best improvers over the past decade: Notable examples include: China has moved from being a talent mover to a talent champion; Indonesia is one of the countries with the greatest strides in talent competitiveness over the past decade; Mexico has moved from being a talent laggard to a talent mover; and Brazil has progressed may well soon categorise as a talent mover.”

Singapore, Switzerland and the United States are among the top three countries on the scale.

European countries continue to dominate the ‘Top 25’ rankings. For the first time, Japan has dropped out from top 25, and South Korea has moved up in its place."
Vinod Adani Among 66 Indians Who Got Cyprus’s ‘Golden Passport’ Between 2014 and 2020: Report,https://m.thewire.in/article/business/vinod-adani-among-66-indians-who-got-cypruss-golden-passport-between-2014-and-2020-report,"Nov 15, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: Between 2014 and 2020, 66 Indians managed to obtain Cyprus passports within three months to a year, under the tax haven’s “golden passport” scheme, the Indian Express, in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), reported, as part of Cyprus Confidential.

Cyprus Confidential is a worldwide offshore probe of 3.6 million documents in English and Greek, exposing a trail of companies established in Cyprus as a tax haven by global elites, including Russian oligarchs.

Also known as the “Cyprus Investment Programme”, the “golden passport” scheme was launched in 2007. It enabled financially prominent individuals to obtain Cypriot citizenship, thereby attracting foreign direct investments into the country.

Among the 66 Indians who got their “golden passport” are Vinod Adani, Gautam Adani’s elder brother who came under spotlight in Hindenburg Research’s investigation; Pankaj Oswal, chairman and founder of Burrup Holdings Limited, and real estate baron Surendra Hiranandani.

According to the European Commission’s website, Cyprus repealed its “golden passport” scheme and stopped receiving new applications on November 1, 2020. However, it continued to process pending applications. As a result, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion to Cyprus on June 9, 2021. Since then, Cyprus stopped processing applications.

The scheme was scrapped due to alleged misuse and for allowing persons with criminal charges, dubious character and PEPs (politically exposed persons) to acquire Cyprus passports, the Indian Express reported.

Names of a total of 83 individuals were flagged for review and possible revocation. A majority of them were earlier citizens of Russia and, according to the data, most were marked for applications bearing “false statement by the investors”, the daily reported.

A Commission appointed by the Attorney General of Cyprus, Georgios Savvides, in September 2020 and headed by retired Supreme Court Chairman, Myron Nicolatos, made the list of these possible revocations.

However, the Cyprus government has not yet officially revealed how many of those under the scanner had their Cypriot citizenships revoked, the daily noted.

Revocations

According to the newspaper, there is only one Indian on the list of proposed revocations of Cypriot passports – Anubhav Aggarwal, a businessman whose “golden passport” was approved within four months on November 2, 2016.

The Nicolatos Commission’s inquiry report states that Aggarwal was implicated in the National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL) scam and that he failed to mention his links with the suspect companies in his application for citizenship.

Being a “key accused” in the Rs 3,600 crore NSEL scam, Aggarwal faced arrest in Abu Dhabi in August 2020. In June 2020, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) seized his properties.

Aggarwal isn’t the only Indian obtaining Cypriot citizenship under the now-defunct investment scheme, despite legal issues with Indian authorities.

Nesamanimaran Muthu, better known as MGM Maran, a Tamil Nadu-based businessman and former chairman of the Tamil Nadu Mercantile Bank Limited, acquired Cypriot citizenship in 2016. His application was cleared in just two months. In 2017, his two children also got citizenship.

In December 2022, the ED attached assets worth Rs 200 crores of his Maran’s company, Agrifurane Industries Private Limited.

The central probe agency had issued a media release saying that assets to the tune of Rs 293 crore had been attached by them since an equivalent foreign investment had been made by Maran in two companies in Singapore without approval of the Reserve Bank of India, the IE report noted.

The agency also mentioned Maran’s Cypriot citizenship in an official release. “In order to escape the reach of Indian laws, MGM Maran surrendered his Indian citizenship. Not only that, it was also found that MGM Maran also started transferring his wealth from India to overseas in order to keep the same out of reach of the Indian law enforcement agencies in the garb of overseas direct investments from Southern Agrifurane Industries Private Limited (his flagship company),” the ED claimed.

According to the Cyprus Confidential investigation by OCCRP and other media partners, the Cyprus Ministry of Interior said that they have decided on “the deprivation of citizenship of 233 individuals and of them, 68 individuals are investors and 165 are family members of the investors.”

Allegations over tax evasion



The January 2023 Hindenburg Research report detailed Vinod Adani’s offshore holdings.

The research, which included downloading and cataloguing the entire Mauritius corporate registry, uncovered that Vinod Adani, through several close associates, manages a vast labyrinth of offshore shell entities.

The report said that it identified 38 Mauritius shell entities controlled by Vinod Adani or close associates. It also identified entities that were also “surreptitiously controlled” by Vinod Adani in Cyprus, the UAE, Singapore, and several Caribbean Islands.

With the help of these shell companies, Vinod Adani, per the report, was key in managing “a vast labyrinth of offshore shell entities” to facilitate fraud.

The manipulation, it said, was helping the Adani companies maintain their appearance of financial health.

The Adani Group has denied all these allegations, saying it was “calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India”.

Only after the Hindenburg report, Vinod Adani, who mostly occupied the back seat in business operations of Adani Group, came under the spotlight.

The Adani Group first said that Vinod Adani “does not hold any managerial position in any Adani listed entities or their subsidiaries and has no role in their day to day affairs.”

Later, it added that “the Adani Group and Vinod Adani should be seen as one.”

“Vinod Adani is part of the ‘promoter group’ of various listed entities within the Adani Group,” it clarified.

Among other Indians who obtained Cypriot citizenship are industrialist Pankaj Oswal and his wife Radhika Oswal.

Pankaj Oswal, is founder of Burrup Holdings Limited, a liquid ammonium manufacturer.

He was in the news recently for purchasing one of the world’s most expensive houses in Switzerland for $200 million.

Otis data contains numerous documents related to Cyprol Limited, the company established by Pankaj Oswal in Cyprus, as well as details of his citizenship application and final approval. The Oswals applied for citizenship on April 28, 2017, and it was granted almost a year later on April 4, 2018, the Indian Express reported.

Incidentally, once Pankaj Oswal obtained his Cypriot citizenship, he shut down Cyprol Limited — proof of this is the authorisation he signed as the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) of the company for ConnectedSky, on March 22, 2019 to strike off the company from the Cyprus registry, it added.

ConnectedSky is one of the six financial service providers which over 270 investigative reporters examined for the Cyprus Confidential project.

In April 2016, the couple was barred indefinitely from leaving Australia over tax claims.

In India, it is expected that Cyprus Confidential will compel regulatory and investigative agencies to unveil yet another layer, like they did after previous global investigations revealed substantial instances of tax avoidance and evasion."
"G20 Virtual Summit: India May Avoid Protest During Putin’S Remarks, No New Areas Of Discussion",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/g20-virtual-summit-india-may-avoid-protest-during-putins-remarks-no-new-areas-of-discussion,"Nov 15, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: G20 leaders are scheduled to meet virtually next Wednesday (November 22), roughly a week before India’s term as president of the grouping expires at the end of this month.

The virtual meeting’s agenda is to review the joint declaration made during the G20 summit in September and follow up on proposals made there, media reports have said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the closing ceremony of the summit that it’s the members’ responsibility “to once again look at the suggestions that have come forward [and] to see how their progress can be accelerated”.

Officials familiar with the matter told Business Standard that while such a review is expected to take place during the virtual meeting, new areas of discussion will not be introduced.

Instead, the meeting will allow Brazil, which is in the process of taking over as G20 president on December 1, to take up the concerned policy initiatives next year, Business Standard reported officials as saying.

External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said last week that invitations had been sent to all leaders of the grouping for the meeting.

The business daily added, citing officials, that while final confirmations for all leaders’ attendance are yet to be received, “almost all leaders have confirmed their presence”.

The list of leaders includes Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who did not come to New Delhi for the September summit.

Putin has skipped travelling to such summits after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against him in March.

But as the upcoming meeting is virtual, Indian officials are pre-empting the possibility of a boycott of Putin’s remarks by Western leaders in case he attends by planning to have leaders appear “solo” on the screen, the Economic Times reported.

A new mechanism is being worked out to avoid controversy over the Ukraine war, the report also said.

Disagreements over references to the war had prevented joint communiques after all ministerial meetings held during India’s presidency prior to the main summit.

The Ukraine-Russia conflict as well as the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas are expected to be brought up during the virtual meeting, media reports have said. However, no joint statement will be issued after it ends, Business Standard reported.

Modi’s opening remarks will be telecast live but the rest of the meeting will not, media reports also said."
"The Treatment of Mahua Moitra Is a Case Study on Gender, Power and Politics in India",https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/the-treatment-of-mahua-moitra-is-a-case-study-on-gender-power-and-politics-in-india,"Nov 15, 2023  |  Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay","Mahua Moitra’s penalisation, although its extent is yet to be finalised by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, was preordained. India’s current political regime would have found reasons, sooner rather than later, to punish her for several reasons, not the least because she unabashedly, defied the stereotyped role model of a virtuous mother, sister, daughter or daughter-in-law.

This had to be done ‘now’ for two reasons. One, she was taking on the country’s highest and mightiest consistently and unsparingly. Two, parliamentary elections are imminent and unchecked criticism by her during the remainder of parliament sessions, could be greatly damaging for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Elected to the current Lok Sabha after an ‘eventful’ decade in public life, she earned greater fame and notoriety, depending on which side of the political divide one was, with her maiden parliamentary speech in June 2019, during the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the president.

Women ‘like her’, more often than not, get accused of a several ‘crimes’ almost immediately after stepping into public life. They are targeted because their presence upsets the patriarchal belief that only women conforming to social mores can be successful.

Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi remains among the few Indian women to secure untrammelled power, but, she consolidated her hold, after positioning herself as the only man in her cabinet.

Also read: ‘Over in Minutes’: Ethics Committee Recommends Expulsion of TMC MP Mahua Moitra From Lok Sabha

Moitra’s party chief, Mamata Banerjee, despite her fiery capacities displayed over more than four decades in politics, remains the universal didi. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he infamously hurled that misogynous taunt at her, had to inevitably use her moniker.

Moitra in contrast, did not ‘sanitise’ her sexuality, never denied her relationship and had the gumption to label her primary accuser as a “jilted ex”. It was not surprising that her interrogation during the Ethics Committee meeting was aimed at learning who she spoke with at night and if businessman Darshan Hiranandani’s wife was aware of his interactions with her. Ruling party members in this instance, men especially, behaved like typical male chauvinists unnerved by ‘independent’ women.

To counter women, they know just one trick: painting them as being of ‘easy virtue’. It is not surprising that BJP social media handles took the lead in circulating her pictures with a glass of wine in hand and also being arm in arm with a male political leader.

After acquiring a public image, Moitra was particularly susceptible to being targeted by misogynists because she had no family ‘shield’; a single woman, a divorced one at that, especially if the former spouse is non-Indian, is particularly vulnerable.

Only in exceptional cases can a woman with Moitra’s personal background avoid presumptions about easy ‘availability’. Almost universally, only the virginal or the strictly monogamous-for-life are considered virtuous.

Also read: Mahua Moitra and the Question of Maryada

Her styling, grooming, penchant for branded clothing, and accessories, mirrored Modi’s fashionable outfits and tastes. But, unlike him, she had no socially backward identity and economically underprivileged upbringing to flaunt. Furthermore, questions could be asked about her relationship status because of her gender identity. Similar posers are not put to male politicians, especially from Treasury Benches.

Once relative anonymity derived from association with Rahul Gandhi’s youth brigade ended in 2010, and she switched sides to the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), the risk of orchestrated attacks increased. With the Congress still in power and the BJP emerging as serious challenger, she got opportunities to showcase her skills at playing David while battling Goliaths in TV studios.

Well before successfully contesting the 2016 West Bengal assembly polls, she made a mark, courtesy her way with words, a bristly tongue that knew little restraint, and the aplomb to ask awkward questions to those in power. This drew sharp responses, especially from the BJP which emerged as TMC’ principal opponent in the state. Much of the exasperation stemmed from her being a woman.

One heated exchange thereafter, went all the way to the Calcutta high court. The defamation suit she filed, involved Union minister Babul Supriyo, (paradoxically with her party now) for serving a reminder during a verbal duel on TV, that her name was ascribed to a flower from which a popular indigenous alcoholic drink is made.

Moitra’s ‘arrival’ on the Indian centre stage was however, courtesy her 2019 speech. Shobha De, the high priestess of allusion or innuendo, in a newspaper column, noted the ‘birth’ of a political star’.

Also read: Mahua Moitra Slams Ethics Committee Probe as ‘Filthy, Unethical’, Finds Support From Opposition MPs

In that piece, more space was devoted to assertions like Mamata Banerjee fielding “astonishingly attractive female candidates in the 2019 election” and how “aggression combined with sex appeal works best”.

In contrast, there was little of what she said, whether Moitra politically stung her adversaries or not. Effectively, Moitra’s ‘form’, which included “couture, or handpicked stylish sarees”, was given greater importance than the ‘content’ of her speech.

In her speech during the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President, Moitra listed seven signs of early fascism in Modi’s India. She also drew attention to a poster on fascism, once available in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. It included “rampant sexism” as one of the signs of onrushing fascism.

Gender-based chauvinism has been visible in abundance since the ‘case’ against Moitra was built over the past month. In the Ethics Committee meeting which resulted in Moitra storming out and the opposition members too staging a walk-out, sexual insinuations were ingrained in the questions.

Moitra made her share of errors. The sequence of events, listed to pronounce her guilty, point to her self-righteousness blanking the ability to function within the framework of law. Associating Darshan Hiranandani with her political campaign against Modi and his allegedly ‘favourite’ house of Adani, was not just indiscreet, but also violated law.

Her claim that most MPs share log-in IDs and passwords with their secretarial assistants is not enough to explain why Hiranandani logged into her parliament account from Dubai. Further criminal recommendations, which have been suggested, have the capacity to keep Moitra preoccupied in the months ahead. She would possibly be also made an example for other critics and prod some among them to heed the warnings.

The cash-for-query accusation has certainly not been proved but she has publicly accepted to receiving valuable gifts even though Moitra is likely to have the capacity to purchase those with her own, professionally earned wealth. But, the country’s often not so rational laws could be used to legally haul her up.

Despite being the world’s largest democracy, most Indian political parties are not run on democratic lines. Parties are mostly led by domineering individuals and the TMC is no different. Most party chiefs dislike strong individuals with ambition to bolster their independent public profile.

Moitra erred by assuming that her efforts at enhancing her public image would be acceptable within the party, merely because she was taking on the two most powerful intimately connected individuals. The nexus between politics and business – across parties too, is among the well-known realities of Indian polity.

Moitra is as much a victim of the regime’s viciousness as her overzealousness. In her unsparing drive against the Modi-Adani duo, Moitra erred by not relegating to the backseat her personal efforts at legitimising the space for ‘her kind’ of women in public life.

This fatal error left her with few friends outside the intelligentsia, inconsequential in the world of realpolitik.

Much has been made of the hostile grilling at the Ethics Committee meeting and references to Draupadi’s vastraharan or disrobing from the Mahabharata have been made.

But can it be ignored that Draupadi was not humiliated by the Kauravas alone? Is it not a fact that in the epic tale, her own family was as much to blame for her being shamed?

Much before the ‘final’ punishment for Moitra is declared, TMC appointed her as the president of the Krishnanagar district unit of the party. Is this evidence of the party being more circumspect and not fully backing a fearless parliamentarian who took on not just India’s most powerful but also challenged the most retrograde stereotype?

India's Fresh Nuclear Push May Be Different – But Questions Surround It,https://m.thewire.in/article/energy/ntpc-nuclear-power-corporation-npcil-smr,"Nov 15, 2023  |  M. Rajshekhar","India’s new nuclear push differs from its predecessors.

This time around, the country is not solely banking on its atomic establishment to erect an array of nuclear power plants. As the first part of this series showed, that approach resulted in cost- and time-overruns, and yielded an outcome where India missed every single deadline to boost its nuclear capacity.

In a bid to avoid that fate, India’s new nuclear push stands on two new pillars. First, Nuclear Power Corporation of India will set up reactors in partnership with other state-owned companies like National Thermal Power Corporation. Second, the country is very bullish about Small and Modular Reactors (SMRs). These, goes the thinking, will be cheaper and faster to construct.

These claims – that NPCIL’s joint ventures or JVs will result in a faster rollout, and that SMRs will be competitive against rival forms of energy – have not received the broader scrutiny they deserve.

The JV, first.

Can Ashvini deliver?

The JV between NPCIL and NTPC named Ashvini is neither new nor unique.

It dates back to February 2016 when the NDA government amended the Atomic Energy Act to enable NPCIL to form JVs with other PSUs for setting up nuclear power plants.

The idea here is that JV partners bring their investible surplus to the alliance, while NPCIL brings in nuclear know-how. The controlling stake – in what are 51:49 arrangements – would be with NPCIL.

Between then and now, NPCIL has formed JVs with NTPC, Indian Oil Corporation, and Nalco. “JVs were also mooted with Hindustan Aluminium and Indian Railways, but those have stayed at a MoU level,” Shah Nawaz Ahmad, who oversees India for the World Nuclear Association, said.

Of these, the JV with NTPC seems to have made the most headway. NTPC, which will need to replace its coal fleet with cleaner alternatives, wants to install 2 GW of nuclear energy by 2032; 4.2 GW by 2035; and 20 GW by 2050. SMRs are a part of its strategy. It wants to limit its JV with NPCIL to large reactors – and form a separate JV (where it is the majority partner) to build SMRs with private partners. According to media reports, it has assembled a 15-member team in Mumbai to drive its nuclear ambitions. Beneath these announcements lie a mass of unknowns – like the JV’s capacity to resolve the problems that have hamstrung nuclear power till now.

While NTPC can raise funds more easily than NPCIL, as physicist MV Ramana writes in The Power of Promise, India’s atomic establishment has never really struggled for cash. It has always been well-capitalised.

What about competitiveness against rival forms of energy? Unlike coal-based power plants, nuclear power has little or no running costs. Unlike solar, whose installation cost now stands at Rs 3 crore to Rs 5 crore per megawatt but panels start leaching efficiency after 15 or so years, nuclear plants have a much longer life. A better comparison is with hydel and pumped storage projects (PSPs). They, too, have high upfront costs, can be used for base load generation as well as grid balancing, and have low running costs – dams more so than pumped storage.

This is where things get interesting. At NPCIL, the cost of a nuclear power plant today ranges between Rs 12 crore-Rs 15 crore/MW. Imported reactors cost more. At Mithi Virdi, for instance, the cost per MW for Westinghouse reactors has touched Rs 40 crore.

While the cost/MW for dams and PSPs (Rs 7 crore-Rs 8 crore/MW) is lower than that of nuclear, their costs/unit are similar – Rs 6/unit for a new dam; between Rs 5/unit and Rs 9/unit for a PSP, which incurs costs while pumping water back to the higher reservoir; and around Rs 7/unit for a reactor costing between Rs 15-20 crore/MW.

“Nuclear… remains the dispatchable low-carbon technology with the lowest expected costs in 2025,” says the IEA. “Only large hydro reservoirs can provide a similar contribution at comparable costs but remain highly dependent on the natural endowments of individual countries.”

Land acquisition is one bugbear – but that applies to hydel and PSPs as well.

Technical glitches, however, are a bigger risk. “India has had hardly any standardisation of nuclear plants thus far and without standardisation nuclear cannot compete,” a senior official familiar with the government’s clean energy plans told CarbonCopy on the condition of anonymity. The country has variously imported reactors from countries like France, Russia and the USA. “That is what NTPC is trying to do now—develop standardised designs,” he continues. “India has valuable experience with the standardisation of coal boilers which greatly sped up projects. That is how the idea of Ashvini came about.”

These thoughts echo those of former environment minister Jairam Ramesh who said in an interview recently, “India should have standardised on its own design of a heavy water reactor. It should not depend on imported reactors. Two standard 700 MW reactors are coming up in Kakrapar and more elsewhere. India should standardise on those reactors. We should build on those reactors.

And so, the current expansion hinges on India’s 700 MW Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor. At Kakrapar, where this reactor was rolled out, it posted time-overruns on account of its “First Of a Kind” Systems and delays in procuring critical equipment.

At this time, it’s unclear if the NTPC-NPCIL alliance has ironed out these glitches. CarbonCopy contacted both NTPC and NPCIL for interviews. They did not respond. Subsequently, questions were emailed to both companies. This article will be updated when they respond.

Turn to SMRs and similar questions intensify.

SMRs: An idea whose time has come?

For some time now – especially once renewables’ prices began to drop – the nuclear industry has been trying to boost its own competitiveness. In the past, trying to bring down its costs, nuclear plants have bet on scale, spreading costs over a larger power output. With SMRs, the industry is heading the other way. Instead of building one large reactor, SMR makers want to mass-produce smaller reactors, and to use that scale to drive costs down. Modularity – where complete reactors are shipped out – is also expected to cut installation time and costs.

“If you take a large reactor like Kudankulam, on-site construction cost will be as much as 30-40% of the eventual cost,” said Vinod Sahni, a former director of the Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology at BARC. With SMRs, says manufacturers, installation time will drop from five or more years to less than two. The NDA echoes these claims. SMRs, it says, will yield significant savings in cost and construction time and fast-track nuclear power generation.

These claims by SMR makers have been challenged by others – including the nuclear establishment itself. Can mass production drive down reactor prices? The answer to that question lies in a thicket of deeper questions. In any manufacturing process, raw material costs account for a large chunk of costs. Efficiencies result from factors like cheaper sourcing of inputs by placing large orders; spreading the cost of the assembly plant, R&D, etc, over a larger output; and so on. And so, how many reactors will an assembly line need to produce to score meaningful savings on manufacturing costs? In a paper about the competitiveness of nuclear power, Ramana estimated the cost/MW of SMRs will match that of large reactors only after anywhere between 700 and 60,000 reactors have been manufactured.

Given that anywhere between 40 and 70 SMRs are in development across the world, how many reactors can each assembly line expect to manufacture each year? During installation, SMRs face the same risk as large reactors—of cost and time-overruns. Once installed, they produce the same externalities as large reactors (like accidents and radioactive waste disposal) and, ergo, have similar system costs as large reactors (boilers, turbines, safety systems, staff). All these costs, however, have to be recovered from lower power output. That will add to the cost per unit.

On the whole, SMRs might be much costlier than large reactors. In his talk at the India Nuclear Business Platform, A.K. Nayak, head (Nuclear Control and Program Wing) at the Department of Atomic Energy, pegged the “ballpark” cost of erecting an SMR at “Rs 200 million/MW” – or Rs 20 crore/MW.

Their running cost might be higher as well. “Given their smaller size, SMRs have a greater surface area,” said Grover. “Which means greater neutron leakage and therefore, more spent fuel.” This point has been made elsewhere as well. “A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that SMRs would create up to 30 times more radioactive waste per unit of electricity than conventional reactors”, reported Energy Monitor.

What about cost per unit? As IEEFA reported earlier this year, “NuScale’s first power plant… increased its initial estimated electricity cost from 5.8 cents per kWh to 8.9 cents per KWh. That increase [a jump from Rs 7.25/unit to Rs 10.3/unit] would have been even higher if not for $4 billion in federal tax subsidies and a $30/MWh subsidy,” added the Australian energy think-tank.

At ₹10.3/unit (or more), SMRs will be more expensive than pumped storage – which can also address intermittency and ensure grid stability. “I am not sure SMRs are a fruitful LT investment,” said author Prabir Purkayastha. “But pumped storage is. You can use it to cycle up and down. You can create these in small areas. They can do daily balancing as well as long-term balancing.”

For all these reasons, India’s nuclear community is not convinced. “Nowhere in the world have SMRs been used,” academic R. Rajaraman said in April. “We are yet to see a proof of concept. It’s all ambitious talk and exaggerated claims.”

These numbers – coupled with the absence of commercial models in the market and reluctance within the nuclear establishment—raise a large question. Support for SMR comes from elsewhere in the government. “In the DAE (Department of Atomic Energy) and Niti Aayog, some see SMRs as an opportunity,” Grover said. “They think SMRs can be deployed quickly and economically.”

As this article was being finalised, news came too that NuScale had terminated its agreement with Utah. “NuScale’s Utah plant was expected to be the first SMR to win a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for construction,” reported Reuters. Concerns about uncompetitiveness were a major reason.

The question writes itself. Why is India so bullish about an untested technology?

A question of risk

At this time, the world is seeing as many as 70 SMR models under development.

“NuScale is creating a small reactor by downsizing an existing reactor,” said Ahmad. “Others are innovating new designs. In the next three to four years, an array of SMRs will be offered as the first of a kind. These will range from micro (200 to 500 kw) to small (below 300 MW).” (India has its own small reactor. This is the 300 MW AHWR300-LEU. Developed by BARC, it runs on thorium and plutonium. It, however, is not modular).

Most SMR makers are eyeing developing countries which need to decarbonise but don’t have enough solar, wind and hydel potential to quit coal. Take NuScale. It hopes to build SMRs in Romania, Kazakhstan, Poland and Ukraine.

And India. As Nayak said at his conference: India has to retrofit 22O GW of thermal capacity. “With a ballpark figure of 200 Mn INR/ MW, business has a potential of INR 44 Trillion (USD 550 Billion) over the next 20 years,” he said. Add industrial demand for SMRs and that number will swell further.

One outcome is lobbying. At this time, a bevy of foreign SMR manufacturers – chiefly Westinghouse, Holtec, NuScale, Rosatom — are eyeing India. Hardwired into their lobbying is the worry that India might relax vital safeguards and invest billions in an uncompetitive source of electricity.

Unlike thermal power plants (TPP), SMRs cannot be installed in seismic zones. This means NTPC’s TPPs around Delhi, for instance, cannot be retro-fitted. Also, nuclear reactors are required to have an exclusion zone—a 1.6 km radius—around them. Most thermal power projects, however, have towns and villages pressing up against their walls. In other words, to install SMRs, NTPC will have to either acquire land for a safety zone around power plants being retro-fitted or the government will have to do away with this stipulation.

The government is also soft-pedalling the civil liability issue. “That has been pushed to the backburner,” said the senior government official. “It is a part of the law but it is not at the centre of these discussions. It will not be a deal breaker.”

The questions write themselves. Should nuclear or renewables and pumped storage take the base-load? How much nuclear power should India build? Should it focus on large reactors or SMRs?

These are vital queries. To set up 10,000 MW of SMR capacity, India will need to spend Rs 200,000 crore. For this sum, it could set up 16,000 MW of large reactors. Or, at Rs 7.5 crore/MW, 25,000 MW of pumped storage capacity. Alternately, should the country invest in smarter grids?

The bigger question

Modern grid operators, wrote Ramana recently, are trying to create 100% renewable grids by addressing intermittency without falling back on “baseload” generation.

“The first and foremost is energy efficiency, which reduces demand, especially during periods of peak use…. A second option is demand flexibility… wherein utilities compensate electricity customers that lower their use when asked – often automatically and imperceptibly – helping balance supply and demand.”

One recent study found, he writes, that “the U.S. has 200 gigawatts of cost-effective load flexibility potential that could be realised by 2030 if effective demand response is actively pursued.” Before embarking on the nuclear buildup, India needs tno ascertain the equivalent number for itself – and then see how much additional base load it needs. The costs of not doing so are stranded nuclear plants – or expensive power for users.

Instead of having those conversations, however, India is rushing to embrace SMRs. Not only does all this draw the country’s ill-fated adventure with Enron to mind, it also highlights a larger flaw in India’s response to climate change. As journalist Joydeep Gupta had commented in a recent article for ThirdPole, secrecy pervades South Asian countries’ responses to climate change.

In the case of nuclear, India is embarking on an expensive buildup – even thinking of retooling safety norms – without much of a discussion on viability, alternatives and attendant costs."
How India Is Shifting Its Nuclear Power Plans Into High Gear,https://m.thewire.in/article/energy/how-india-is-shifting-its-nuclear-power-plans-into-high-gear,"Nov 13, 2023  |  M. Rajshekhar","On December 14 last year, Union minister of state for Atomic Energy and Space Jitendra Singh made an announcement with far-reaching consequences.

In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Singh said the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government will commission 20 new nuclear reactors by 2031. With that, he said, India’s installed nuclear capacity will treble from the current 7,480 megawatt (MW) to 22,480 MW.

Ten of these reactors – like the 500 MW Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor at Kalpakkam and the two 1,000 MW reactors at Kudankulam – are already under construction. In addition, the government has granted “administrative and financial sanctions” for building 10 more nuclear plants with 700 MW Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors at Gorakhpur (Haryana), Kaiga (Karnataka), Chutka (Madhya Pradesh) and Mahi Banswara (Rajasthan).

That is just the start. Another clutch of reactors have secured in-principle approvals. Once all these projects are up, the number of India’s nuclear reactors will rise from the current 22 to well above 50.

That is not all. The NDA government is also bullish on SMRs, typically below 300 MW in capacity, and wants to use them for both power generation and to decarbonise industry. National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) is thinking of retro-fitting small modular reactors (SMRs) into decommissioned coal plants. In August, speaking at a conclave on green hydrogen and net zero, senior NITI Aayog official V.K. Saraswat said industrial units too should use SMRs to produce hydrogen.

Some of the projected numbers are mind-boggling. The installed capacity of coal-fired plants in India stands around 220 gigawatt (GW). “[Of this 220 GW], 20 GW is already off the grid and gradually others will also be coming in the line,” A.K. Nayak, head (Nuclear Control and Program Wing) at the Department of Atomic Energy said last December at a conference organised by India Nuclear Business Platform, a nuclear power advocacy firm owned by a Singapore-based consultancy called Industry Platform.

These, he said, can be refitted with SMRs. “There is a big opportunity for SMRs in a span of 2-3 decades… For interested companies like NTPC and others it is a business opportunity of 220 GW.”

Going by such projections, SMRs might play a bigger role in India than large reactors.

The case for nuclear

A curious silence has accompanied most of these plans. Barring the odd media report outlining the government’s plans for nuclear power and op-eds in favour of SMRs, there has not been enough critical discussion around this proposed nuclear buildup.

Can nuclear energy help India step away from coal? Has the industry resolved its old problems with cost- and time-overruns? What about public safety? Given the world continues to innovate in renewables, should India go for 100% renewables or push to add nuclear capacity as well?

On the energy front, the country is stuck between a rock and a hard place. In 2022-23, its power demand stood at 1,503 billion units (BUs). This demand was met through an installed power generation capacity of 415.4 GW, with 236.68 GW coming from coal, lignite and gas. Renewables – hydel, solar, bio-energy, wind and pumped storage – accounted for 171.8 GW.

As India decarbonises, not only will most of these thermal units be wound down, the country will also see additional demand for electricity as other users of hydrocarbons – like factories and vehicles – electrify as well. By 2030, India’s Central Electricity Authority expects the country’s electricity demand to touch 2,279 BU. By 2050, says Energy Monitor, power demand might touch 5,921 BUs. At this point, the country might need as much as 4,000 GW of installed capacity – almost a 10-fold jump from today.

That is where a massive constraint asserts itself. India’s potential RE capacity – between hydel, solar and wind – is currently estimated at no more than 1,000 GW.

It gets worse. The country cannot build to full potential capacity – building 145,000 MW of dams will extract its own social and ecological costs. As will unfettered expansion of solar parks and wind farms. India can reduce total future power demand – by slashing transmission and distribution losses or by providing Indians lower per capita power than the global average by embracing greater energy efficiency – but there will still be a shortfall.

One morning in April, seeking to understand all this better, CarbonCopy met nuclear scientist Ravi Grover at his office in Mumbai’s Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. Given the size of its population, he said in that chat, India will have to use all the energy options with her.

That morning, Grover outlined another reason why India needs nuclear power. In the past, power supply was constant (thanks to thermal power plants) while demand waxed and waned. “Balance between supply and demand was usually maintained through load-shedding,” he told CarbonCopy.

That is changing now, he said. As the share of renewables in India’s energy mix rises, both supply and demand will become variable. The country’s electricity system will need additional investments – pumped storage, battery storage, electrolysers, what have you – to balance demand and supply.

Delivering what Grover describes in Current Science as “firm power”, nuclear power can also help address intermittency. “If India wants 200 GW of renewable power, then we should try to have 20-40 GW of nuclear as well,” he told CarbonCopy. “That is what the world is doing. The UK will be 25% nuclear by the middle of this century. France is adding eight to 14 new reactors. India, too, needs to add three to four times as much nuclear capacity. What we have is not enough.”

There is, however, one big problem.

Broken promises

This is not the first time India has mapped out a large buildup of nuclear capacity.

In the past, too, variably citing military security, energy security and looming energy shortages, India’s nuclear establishment has pushed for rapid expansion of the country’s nuclear power capacity.

In 1954, Homi Bhabha, the founder of India’s nuclear programme, said India would have 8,000 MW of nuclear capacity by 1980. In 1960, the country was told it would have 43,500 MW by 2000. In 1984, a decade after the 1974 nuclear test, the country was promised 10,000 MW by 2000. The actual installed capacity was about 600 MW in 1980 and 2,720 MW in 2000.

In 1999, India’s nuclear establishment said the country would have 20,000 MW by 2020. In the early 2000s, the DAE (Department of Atomic Energy) upped that target to 275 GW by 2052 – and then to 470 GW after the US-India nuclear deal. India missed those targets as well. Today, the country’s installed nuclear capacity stands at 7,480 MW.

A clutch of factors are responsible for this under-delivery. Some are global. India’s nuclear tests left the country struggling to source technology and nuclear fuels. In more recent years, the Nuclear Liability Act has dissuaded foreign nuclear suppliers from entering the market.

Others are local. As physicist M.V. Ramana wrote in The Power of Promise, his 2012 book on India’s nuclear power aspirations, lack of scale has been a problem. “The problem was not that the industry lacked the technological base needed to carry out the fabrication [of the reactors], but that the few orders that it received from the DAE did not make it economical for companies to do so.”

Land acquisition has been another bugbear. Design changes during construction are yet another. In all, as Ramana wrote, India’s nuclear plants have been plagued by cost- and time-overruns, and performed worse than envisaged.

This is where things get interesting.

Stepping around past glitches

To ensure the latest nuclear buildup doesn’t meet the fate of its predecessors, the BJP-led NDA government has made two changes.

First, Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) has been told to jointly develop nuclear plants with firms like NTPC. The rationale? Not only can NTPC raise funds more easily than NPCIL, by pooling their strengths in project management and nuclear plant design, NPCIL and NTPC can set up nuclear plants faster. This point was made at the India Nuclear Business Platform conference last December.

“Earlier NPCIL was executing one or two projects at a time, but now with capacity getting ramped up substantially, the plan is that NPCIL along with NTPC will be running at least 10 nuclear projects at a time,” said R. Sharan, director (projects), NPCIL.

Second, seeking to obviate risks like time/cost overruns and the difficulty of land acquisition, the NDA is bullish on SMRs.

In tandem, it is also getting easier for India to source nuclear technology from outside. As nuclear energy tries to regain ground lost to renewables, a bevy of large reactor makers and SMR manufacturers are competing to crack markets like India. Anyone trying to understand the role of nuclear in India’s emerging energy mix has to engage with these shifts in policy.

Two questions, therefore, arise. Both the NPCIL-NTPC alliance and SMRs are untested experiments. Can they deliver? Further, the competitive landscape for nuclear power is changing. It no longer competes with coal and gas. Instead, billions are being spent to boost efficiency of existing renewable technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, rechargeable batteries and develop newer sources of renewable power like electrolysers. Countries are also experimenting with technologies like pumped storage and grid management to create 100% renewable grids.

So can SMRs—and NTPC—carve out a perch for nuclear power in India?

The second part of the series will look into this question.

"Trade Unions Denounce Israeli Call to Replace Palestinian Workers, Urge India to Reject Request",https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/trade-unions-denounce-israeli-call-to-replace-palestinian-workers-urge-india-to-reject-request,"Nov 13, 2023  |  Alishan Jafri","New Delhi: In a strongly worded joint statement issued on November 9, ten major trade unions in India, under the banner of the Joint Platform of Central Trade Unions and Independent Federations, called on the Indian government to reject Israel’s construction sector’s request to replace Palestinian workers with Indian workers amid the ongoing war on Gaza.

Following the October 7 attacks against Israel, tens of thousands of Palestinian workers in the Israeli construction industry have been suspended. Voice of America reported that Israel’s construction sector had urged the Indian government to allow companies to hire up to 100,000 workers from India to replace the 90,000 Palestinians who roughly form about 25% of the workforce in the sector.

On November 9, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said that he is not aware of any such particular request from Israel.

“With Israel, there are already a number of Indian workers employed there, especially in the caregiver sector. Since, I think, 2022, we have been discussing a bilateral framework in the construction and caregiver sectors, but this is a long-term initiative and I am not, as I said, aware of any specific requests or numbers that have been floating around,” Bagchi said, per a transcript of the media briefing on the MEA website.

The joint platform of independent trade unions criticised the Modi government’s stand on the conflict as “unethical” and “duplicitous”.

“Nothing could be more immoral and disastrous for India than the said “export” of workers to Israel. That India is even considering “exporting” workers shows the manner in which it has dehumanised and commodified Indian workers. Such a step will amount to complicity on India’s part with Israel’s ongoing genocidal war against Palestinians and will naturally have adverse implications for Indian workers in the entire region,” the press release issued by the platform said.

Describing Israel’s war on Gaza as “shamelessly genocidal”, the trade unions have called upon Indian workers to show solidarity with Palestinian workers and refuse to replace them.

“India’s trade union movement must rise in solidarity with Palestinian workers and reject this disastrous idea. Let’s resolve that we will not work to replace Palestinian workers in Israel,” the joint statement said. It has also called upon Indian workers to boycott Israeli products and to refuse to handle the Israeli cargo."
"At UN Human Rights Review, India Calls on Canada to Prevent 'Misuse' of Freedom of Expression",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/unhrc-india-canada-universal-periodic-review,"Nov 12, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: Amidst strained relations, India urged Canada during the review of its human rights record at the UNHRC to boost its legal framework to stop the “misuse” of freedom of expression to incite violence and prevent activities of extremist groups.

This call by India was presented as part of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process, under which member states of the United Nations undergo a periodic evaluation of their human rights records conducted by the 47 members of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.

On November 10, Canada underwent the UPR process for the fourth time, receiving evaluations from the UPR working group, consisting of all UNHRC members. Canada was among the 14 countries reviewed during the current session.

India offered three suggestions to Canada “in the spirit of constructive dialogue”.

“One, further strengthen the domestic framework to prevent misuse of freedom of expression for inciting violence and disallow activities of groups which are promoting extremism,” said Indian diplomat Mohammed Hussain K.S.

He also called on Canada to “effectively prevent attacks on places of worships of religious and racial minorities” and “strengthen legislative and other measures to address hate crimes and hate speech”.

“Third, put an end to structural discrimination against children belonging to indigenous groups. And address disparities in access to services by all children,” added the Indian representative.

Since Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused India of being involved in the killing of a Sikh Canadian citizen, relations have gone into deep freeze. Both countries expelled a diplomat in a tit-for-tat move, with India taking additional measures of halting visa services for all Canadian nationals. New Delhi further insisted on diplomatic parity, resulting in the departure of 41 Canadian diplomats from India.

India has vehemently rejected the allegations as “absurd” and asked for Canada to share the evidence. Indian officials have also complained that Canada does not take New Delhi’s concerns about activities of Khalistani separatists seriously.

In a recent interview with a Canadian newspaper, India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Sanjay Kumar Varma said that there had been no action taken on 26 requests made to Canada to extradite people to India.

India had especially umbrage at the posters and banners put up by Khalistani groups in Canada that specifically targeted Indian diplomats. Canadian officials had, however, expressed their inability to put charges because the language used in those posters had been within the legal threshold of permissibility.

On November 10, Indian foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra claimed that India had “core security concerns” after the United States Secretary of State Anthony Blinken again asked New Delhi to join the Canadian investigation.

During the previous UPR cycle that Canada underwent in 2018, India put forth six recommendations, which had also included calling for prevention of “misuse of freedom of expression” and “glorify[ing] terrorists as martyrs”."
'Exposure to Air Pollution Changes the Way Our Airways Behave’: Surge in Respiratory Symptoms in Delhi,https://m.thewire.in/article/environment/exposure-to-air-pollution-changes-the-way-our-airways-behave-surge-in-respiratory-symptoms-in-delhi,"Nov 10, 2023  |  Taniya Roy","New Delhi: The national capital’s air quality has reached alarming levels, with adverse consequences not only on public health but also on the economic front.

Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai on November 8 held a meeting with a team from IIT Kanpur to discuss the possibility of artificial rainfall through cloud seeding to bring down the AQI (air quality index) in the city.

It was decided that artificial rain could be used in Delhi on November 20-21 if the weather is cloudy.

The pollution crisis in Delhi is primarily attributed to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and crop burning in neighboring states. The concentration of harmful pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10 particles has surged, leading to respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and a general decline in the overall well-being of the populace.

Intense air pollution exposure is changing the way our airways behave

Many healthy people have also complained of the new onset symptom of cough, breathlessness, chest tightness, fatigue, headache, eye irritation, and sneezing. “This is not something new. This is what we see during this season. We have been seeing it for the last many years,” Dr. Karan Madan, additional professor, Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told The Wire.

“The way we see these symptoms when air quality goes down does tend to point out that these symptoms are related to worsening air pollution,” he said, when asked if we can attribute these symptoms to a decline in air quality.

“Healthy people get cough, hacking cough, allergies. We treat them just the way we treat asthma. Asthma is an allergic condition. Those healthy people who develop these symptoms, and are responding to inhaled steroids, it won’t be incorrect to say that [air pollution] is triggering asthma-like conditions or probably allergic conditions in healthy people. Many times their hacking cough also requires some treatments with steroids. It does mean that this intense air pollution exposure makes some changes in the way our airways behave,” he said.

Talking about the nature of respiratory illnesses, he said: “We have been consistently noticing for the last many years that when viral infection is going on, we know that. But during these episodes, you don’t find any viral, which is cause of the exacerbation. When the air quality goes down, many people start complaining of these acute respiratory symptoms.”

“For heart patients, it may be more harmful. There are studies to show that air pollution increases the risk of BP; hypertension increases. An increase in BP is not good for any heart patient. Data says very poor air quality is not good for patients with cardiac disease,” he added.

He said that a substantial number of patients with airway diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who are under the hospital follow-up, have reported a notable deterioration in their symptoms. Complaints include increased wheeziness, heightened breathlessness, and a greater need for inhalers.

The severity has escalated to acute asthma attacks, leading to hospitalizations and necessitating intensified treatments, including the administration of oral steroids. The overall frequency of asthma exacerbations or attacks has shown a notable increase.

“Many have had acute asthma attacks, some of which required hospitalisations, and some have required escalation of their treatments. We had to give them oral steroids. Asthma exacerbation or attacks have increased,” he said.

Former AIIMS director and senior pulmonologist Dr. Randeep Guleria told news agency ANI that people with no respiratory diseases are also facing breathing issues.

“Respiratory problems may increase in people with diseases like bronchitis or heart problems, resulting in decreased oxygen saturation and increased emergency visits. In OPD too, more patients with a complaint of breathing are coming. Hospitalisation, ICU admissions, and OPD referrals are increasing in patients and also in those people who are normal and have no disease,” Dr. Guleria told the news agency.

Impact on the economy

Air pollution is the second biggest factor affecting human health in India, according to the World Air Quality Report 2022, prepared by Swiss organisation IQAir. The report was released globally in March 2022.

According to the World Economic Forum, the problem of air pollution costs the Indian economy $95 billion per year. Therefore, there’s a need to reduce air pollution to increase economic growth.

“We found that if India had achieved safe air quality levels in 2019, its GDP would have increased by $95 billion, or 3%, as Indian businesses would face lower costs and higher revenues. This means there was potential to return a value equal to 50% of all tax collected annually, or 150% of India’s healthcare budget. Bringing clean air to India benefits the economy and businesses through lower absenteeism, higher on-the-job productivity, higher consumer footfall and lower premature mortality,” it said in June 2021."
"Remembering Maulana Abul Kalam Azad: A Scholar, Patriot and Builder of Modern India",https://m.thewire.in/article/history/remembering-maulana-abul-kalam-azad-a-scholar-patriot-and-builder-of-modern-india,"Nov 11, 2023  |  Praveen Davar","Maulana Abul Kalam Azad was a stalwart of the freedom struggle who stood out amongst a galaxy of leaders on account of his intellectual prowess and deep commitment to the nationalist politics of 20th-century India. He was a profound thinker, an interpreter of religion, an upholder of secularism, and one of the builders of the modern Indian state. He was a rare combination of high learning, deep intellect, and revolutionary activity.

Azad’s father, Muhammed Khairuddin, was a scholar and mystic. He wrote numerous books in Arabic and Persian, and had a large number of disciples in Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Calcutta. Being the son of a religious leader, Azad received his early education in the traditional manner, directly under the supervision of his father. After acquiring proficiency in Arabic and Persian, he studied Philosophy, Mathematics, and Algebra. He completed the entire course of study by the time he was 16. Soon after, he became a teacher of Philosophy, Mathematics and Logic, and quickly earned recognition as a scholar in Arabic and Persian and in Islamic theology. Azad had inherited from his father the temperament of a scholar, but his thirst for knowledge and his passion for action did not permit him to lead the quiet life of a teacher and religious leader.

At the age of 20, he toured the West Asian countries and came in contact with Arab and Turkish revolutionaries who were working for the freedom of their lands. Abul Kalam was inspired by these people, and on his return to India, he entered politics and started Al Hilal, an Urdu weekly, from Calcutta in 1912 to propagate his ideas. The first issue of Al Hilal was published on June 1, 1912. Abul Kalam was only 24 then, but he had already been accepted as ‘Maulana’ by Muslim theologists. From the very day of its inception, Al Hilal took its stand against British rule in India. In the pages of this journal, he wrote editorials which were remarkable for their beauty of style and forcefulness of language. Through these, the Maulana urged the Muslims of India to come out of their self-imposed political indifference and cooperate with their Hindu brethren in the task of freeing the country from foreign rule. This was a bold and new line of thinking for Indian Muslims and it created a great stir among them.

Ever since the unsuccessful Indian revolt of 1857, Indian Muslims had been living in an atmosphere of despair and lack of faith. Some Muslim leaders like Sir Syed Ahmed Khan tried to restore the confidence of the Indian Muslims by pursuing a policy of gaining the favour of the ruling power and keeping away from the field of active politics.

To Maulana Azad, this policy appeared not only unpatriotic but also un-Islamic. He realised that the interests of Indian Muslims could be served only if they took part in the national struggle for independence. He felt that the liberation of India was necessary for the progress and prosperity of the entire Muslim world. From 1920 till 1945 Abul Kalam Azad was in and out of prison a number of times.

After he was released from Ranchi, he was elected president of the All-India Khilafat Committee (Calcutta session in 1920), and president of the Unity Conference (Delhi) in 1924. In 1928, he presided over the Nationalist Muslim Conference. He was appointed in 1937 as a member of the Congress parliamentary sub-committee to guide the Provincial Congress ministries. He was twice elected president of the Indian National Congress, the first time in 1923 when he was only 35 years old, and the second time in 1940. Addressing the delegates at the Congress session in Ramgarh (Jharkhand) the Maulana stated:

“I am a Muslim and profoundly conscious of the fact that I have inherited glorious traditions of the last thirteen hundred years. I am not prepared to lose even a small part of that legacy. The history and teachings of Islam, its arts and letters, its civilisation and culture, are part of my wealth and it is my duty to cherish and guard them. As a Muslim, I have a special identity within the field of religion and culture… But, with all these feelings, I have another equally deep realisation, born out of my life’s experience, which is strengthened and not hindered by the spirit of Islam. I am equally proud of the fact that I am an Indian, an essential part of the indivisible unity of Indian nationhood, a vital factor in its total makeup without which this noble edifice will remain incomplete. I can never give up this sincere claim.”

According to historian S. Irfan Habib, this was Azad’s response to the exclusivist and faith-based nationalism of Savarkar, which aided the Muslim communalists led by the League to instil fear among Muslims about their future in united India.

Maulana Azad concluded his presidential address thus:

Our shared life of a thousand years has forged a common nationality. Such moulds cannot be artificially constructed. Nature’s hidden anvils shape them over the centuries. The mould has now been cast and destiny has set her seal upon it. Whether we like it or not, we have now become an Indian nation, united and indivisible. No false idea of separatism can break our oneness. We must accept the inexorable logic of facts and apply ourselves to fashioning our future density.

He continued as the president of the Congress till 1946, for no election was held during this period as almost every Congress leader was in prison on account of the Quit India Movement (1942). After the leaders were released Maulana Azad, as the president of the Congress, led the negotiations with the British Cabinet Mission in 1946, and when India became independent he was appointed education minister, a position in which he continued till his death on February 22, 1958. His role as India’s first minister for education was marvellous. Besides setting up many scientific and technological institutions, he founded the Indian Council of Cultural Relations as also the three ‘akademis’ devoted to arts, literature and music. He thus substantially contributed to the fulfilment of Jawaharlal Nehru’s vision of modern and liberal India.

Two events in Maulana’s life in the years leading to independence are worth recalling. In 1939, Mahatma Gandhi, opposed to the re-election of Subhas Chandra Bose as president of the Indian National Congress, proposed Azad’s name, but the latter, after initially accepting the offer, withdrew from the contest. This was politically correct as a contest against Subhas Chandra Bose, who was then at the peak of his popularity, was too risky. Hence Azad chose discretion as the better part of valour. Like Gandhi, Maulana Azad was opposed to the partition of India right till the end. But unlike the Frontier Gandhi, and like Gandhi, he ultimately gave in to the Mountbatten Plan.

According to historian Rajmohan Gandhi, “By the end of March 1947, Patel had become keen on division and, later, Nehru too was reconciled to it — Azad too acquiesced. In India Wins Freedom, he has written of his battles to prevent division but at Congress’s meetings, he did not oppose the Mountbatten Plan. Neither the Mahatma nor the Maulana defied Nehru and Patel who were backed by Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, Govind Ballabh Pant and many others.”

This is corroborated by Acharya Kripalani, Congress President in 1946, and a bitter critic of Azad. The Acharya writes in his biography of Mahatma: “In his book India Wins Freedom (pp. 192-97), Maulana Azad has said that he was against partition and that he had made his opinion clear to Gandhiji. I do not know what private conferences he had with Gandhiji. All I know is that he never opposed it in the Working Committee or the AICC.”

Soon after partition, deeply hurt and angry, addressing a vast multitude from the pulpit of Delhi’s Jama Masjid the Maulana gave them hope and confidence:

I told you that the two-nation theory was the death knell of a life of faith and belief … Those on whom you relied for support have forsaken you, left you helpless …. dear brethren ! I have no new antidote for you, only something that was brought about 1400 years ago…. do not fear and do not grieve. And you will indeed gain the upper hand if you are possessed of true faith.

Maulana Azad died on February 22, 1958, before he turned 70. A week before he died prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited the ailing Maulana who looked in the eyes of his beloved friend and said, “Jawahar Khuda Hafiz.” No better words could express the personality of the great scholar than Nehru’s tribute in Parliament on February 24, 1958, “It has become almost a commonplace, when a prominent person passes away, to say that he is irreplaceable. That is often true; yet, I believe that it is literally and absolutely true in regard to the passing away of Maulana Azad. We have had great men and we will have great men, but I do submit that the peculiar and special type of greatness which Maulana Azad represented is not likely to be reproduced in India or anywhere else — we mourn today the passing of a great man, a man of luminous intelligence and mighty intellect with an amazing capacity to pierce through a problem to its core.”

Indeed the greatness of Maulana, like Nehru himself, cannot be reproduced here or anywhere.

New Delhi: Even as both countries reaffirmed their solidarity with Israel against terrorism, the United States urged India to cooperate with Canada on its investigation of the killing of a Sikh Canadian citizen, while New Delhi asserted that it had “core security concerns” about separatist activities during bilateral talks held on Friday (November 10).

The fifth edition of the ‘2+2’ foreign and defence ministerial meeting was held on Friday in the Indian capital, with US secretary of state Anthony Blinken and secretary of defence Lloyd Austin heading the US delegation, while India was represented by Union external affairs minister S. Jaishankar and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh.

For the first time, there was no joint press conference addressed by all four ministers after the end of the ‘2+2’ discussions. India’s foreign and defence secretaries addressed the media, while Austin and Blinken had separate briefings with their travelling media.

With discussions ranging from China to South Asia and West Asia to Ukraine, the two sides had a lot to talk about, besides the usual bilateral agenda of strengthening cooperation in defence and a host of other sectors.

Concluded a substantive India-US 2+2 Ministerial Meeting. Followed up on PM @narendramodi’s State visit to the US this June. Our agenda covered advancing our strategic partnership, including elevating our defense ties, moving forward in space & tech, future logistics… pic.twitter.com/f7ezKlM0tj — Dr. S. Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) November 10, 2023

However, it was particularly noteworthy that Blinken chose to directly address the Canadian issue during a separate bilateral meeting with his Indian counterpart Jaishankar preceding the talks on Friday morning.

India’s relations with Canada had nosedived after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused unnamed Indian government agents of being implicated in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen described by India as a Khalistani terrorist.

From the beginning, the United States has consistently urged India to participate in the Canadian investigation, a sentiment reiterated by Blinken during his visit to New Delhi on Friday.

“As a friend of both, we think it’s very important that India work with Canada on its investigation, and that they find a way to resolve this difference in a cooperative way,” he told reporters.

Following a reciprocal expulsion of one diplomat each by Canada and India, an additional 41 Canadian diplomats departed when New Delhi insisted on downsizing Ottawa’s diplomatic presence in the Indian capital.

India had also stopped visa services for Canadian nationals, a restriction that was partially lifted after approximately three weeks.

India’s foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra reiterated that New Delhi remained concerned about security implications from the threats made by Khalistani separatists against Indian diplomats.

“We have made our concerns very, very clear,” he told reporters on Friday. “We have core security concerns and I am sure you are all aware of a recent video that has surfaced from one such individual.”

Canadian officials reportedly intercepted communications among Indian diplomats suggesting India’s involvement in Nijjar’s death, but New Delhi has reiterated that it has not received any evidence from Ottawa about the killing.

US ambassador to Canada David Cohen had said that “shared information” from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance had informed Trudeau’s decision to go public with the allegations.

Incidentally, the joint statement released following the conclusion of the discussions emphasised the two nations’ shared commitment to “advance democracy, human rights, and pluralism”.

Notably, the phrase ‘human rights’ was included in this statement, distinguishing it from the joint statement issued after the ‘2+2’ talks in 2022, which only mentioned democracy and pluralism.

Barring the differences over Canada, India and the US were upbeat that they had reached strategic alignment on several crucial areas.

Using blunt language, Singh asserted that both India and the United States were in agreement when it came to addressing the challenges posed by China.

“We increasingly find ourselves in agreement on strategic issues, including countering China’s aggression, promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific, and addressing regional security challenges,” said Singh at the start of his bilateral talks with Austin.

India is currently in the midst of a military stand-off with China on the Line of Actual Control that began in April-May 2020. While several of the friction points have witnessed de-escalation, the two strategic areas of Depsang and Demchok continue to show no sign of resolution.

Incidentally, the United States has been actively pursuing a meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco this month.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided to skip the summit despite a standing invitation extended to him during Biden’s visit to India for the G-20 summit.

Speaking with the media, US defence secretary Austin said that the talks did cover the “threat posed by China”, but noted that entire dialogue was not spent just discussing the Asian giant.

Along with China, the joint statement on the ‘2+2’ talks demonstrated their similar position on the Israel-Hamas war.

“Noting horrific terrorist attacks against Israel, the ministers reiterated that India and the United States stand with Israel against terrorism and called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including with regard to the protection of civilians,” said the bilateral document.

Calling for the immediate release of all hostages, the joint statement further stated that the two sides were committed to “continue coordinating with partners in the region on humanitarian assistance to meet the urgent needs of Palestinian civilians in Gaza”.

India and the US reiterated their support for “humanitarian pauses”. This is a day after Israel agreed to allow the halting of fighting for four hours every day.

“They expressed support for humanitarian pauses and committed to continue close diplomatic coordination, including with key partners in the region, to prevent the conflict from spreading, preserve stability in the Middle East, and work toward a political solution and durable peace,” said the joint statement.

Immediately after the October 7 attack by Hamas, Modi had expressed “solidarity” with Israel.

However, a week later, India had to balance Modi’s statement by reaffirming support for the “Palestinian cause” and the two-state solution.

Despite this, India abstained from a resolution at the UN General Assembly calling for humanitarian pauses, arguing that it should also have condemned the October 7 attack that resulted in the death of 1,400 people.

Blinken said that Israel’s action to allow for ‘humanitarian pauses’ was positive but not enough.

“Much more needs to be done to protect civilians and to make sure that humanitarian assistance reaches them,” he told reporters in New Delhi on Friday, at the end of his nine-day sojourn through the Middle East and Asia.

He continued: “Far too many Palestinians have been killed, far too many have suffered these past weeks, and we want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximise the assistance that gets to them.”

According to Gaza’s health ministry, the death toll among Palestinians in Israeli counter-strikes has exceeded 11,000 people.

Absence of Pakistan in the joint statement

Although both nations expressed solidarity with Israel against terrorism, this year’s joint statement notably omitted any mention of Pakistan or “cross-border” terrorism, a departure from previous editions.

At the inaugural ‘2+2’ joint statement in 2018, the four ministers had “called on Pakistan to ensure that the territory under its control is not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries”.

It had also denounced the use of “terrorist proxies in the region”.

Similarly, the joint statements of the second, third and fourth ‘2+2’ ministerial dialogues had explicitly named Pakistan and referred to the need to stop “cross-border” terror attacks.

But there is no mention of Pakistan in the 2023 joint statement. There is not even an oblique reference to the South Asian country through the euphemistic term ‘cross-border’ terror.

In 2022, the joint statement had talked about exchanging information about the “cross-border movement of terrorists” in the same sentence about the need for implementing sanctions against terror groups, countering violent radicalism and use of the Internet for terrorist purposes.

This year, the negotiated joint statement stated that the ministers “condemned terrorism and violent extremism, and the use of terrorist proxies and logistical, financial or military support to terrorist organisations, which could be used to launch or plan terrorist attacks, including international attacks”.

It reiterated the need for justice for the 26/11 and Pathankot terror attacks, as well as the need for action against UN proscribed terror groups “such as Al-Qa’ida, ISIS/Daesh, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, and Jaish-e-Mohammed”, but without any explicit mention of Pakistan, for the first time since the start of the ministerial-level dialogue.

Bangladesh also featured in the India-US ministerial talks, highlighting the differing approaches between India and the US in the lead-up to the general elections there next year.

The Bangladeshi opposition has threatened to boycott the elections if a caretaker government is not established. The US has started to impose visa restrictions on members of the ruling establishment for allegedly being complicit in undermining free and fair elections.

Foreign secretary Kwatra said that India shared its perspective on Bangladesh clearly. “It is not our space to comment on the policy of a third country … the election in Bangladesh is their internal matter and it is for the people of Bangladesh to decide their future,” he stated.

Disagreeing with the American approach, the senior Indian diplomat added that as a “close friend”, India “respect[s] the democratic process in Bangladesh and will continue to support the country’s vision of a stable, peaceful and progressive nation”.

A day earlier, the spokesperson for the Indian external affairs ministry had declined to censure the Bangladesh government for the arrest of senior opposition leaders ahead of the polls.

Earlier this week, an Awami League leader had threatened to “beat up” US ambassador to Dhaka Peter Haas, which was criticised by the State department.

On the defence front, Austin reiterated the importance of the co-production of an armoured vehicle.

The two countries also agreed to set up “new liaison positions to facilitate seamless communication and cooperation between their armed forces”.

The visitors called on Modi together on Friday evening, before departing from New Delhi."
India Rejects Australian Court’s Jurisdiction in Judgment Against Former Indian Diplomat,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-rejects-australian-courts-jurisdiction-in-judgment-against-former-indian-diplomat,"Nov 09, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","Representative image of the Indian High Commission in Canberra.

New Delhi: India rejected the jurisdiction of an Australian court over its ex-parte direction to its former high commissioner to pay a penalty to an Indian staff member for violating local wage standards and announced plans on Thursday, November 9, to address the issue with Australian authorities.

On November 3, an Australian federal court ordered India’s former high commissioner to Canberra Navdeep Singh Suri to pay A$136,000 to a former staff member employed at the official residence for not paying her as per Australia’s 2009 Fair Work Act.

The Wire had reported earlier on the implications of the judgment on diplomatic privileges and immunities, since the complainant Seema Shergill had been in Australia with an official passport with a diplomatic visa during the period of the dispute.

In the first response from India, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said that New Delhi “reject[s] any locus standi of Australian authorities to adjudicate on matters concerning such India-based Service Staff of the High Commission”.

Stating that India was “taking up the matter” with Australia, Bagchi urged Canberra “to uphold its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, particularly in relation to diplomatic immunities and privileges”.

Seema Shergill had travelled with Suri as India-based service staff in 2015. A year later, she left the official residence, known as India House, without information.

Bagchi claimed that Shergill had “willfully deserted her post in May 2016, a day before her scheduled return to India”.

“Since then, we have repeatedly requested Australian authorities to locate and repatriate her to India. We have learnt that she has made allegations against the then High Commissioner, and an ex-parte judgment has now been issued by an Australian court,” he noted.

Pointing out that she was an India-based service staff at the diplomatic mission, the MEA spokesperson asserted that any grievance had to be redressed only in India.

“Her conduct and false representations give rise to suspicions that all this has been motivated by her desire to permanently stay in Australia, and in which she seems to have succeeded. We are also concerned by the ex-parte court judgment,” he said.

According to sources, Shergill declined to sign a compulsory undertaking in May 2016 committing to return to India after completing a three-year tenure – a provision introduced in response to the Khobragade affair.

Sources had pointed out that diplomats and staff receive salaries according to Indian scales.

Additionally, there were concerns that the ruling might prompt service staff in Indian missions abroad to pursue compensation under local laws and potentially persuade them to use this as a path towards citizenship."
Fintechs Eye Growing Demand of Affluent Indians While Rural Demand Sees Sluggish Recovery,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/fintechs-eye-growing-demand-of-affluent-indians-while-rural-demand-sees-sluggish-recovery,"Nov 09, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: A report by venture capital firm Elevation Capital and McKinsey India shows how fintech companies have a massive opportunity to be able to cater to the expanding base of wealthy individuals.

According to the Economic Times, the report estimates that by fiscal year 2030, the number of affluent Indians is set to triple to 30 million, up from the current 10 million, potentially doubling the revenue pool in this sector to $80-100 billion.

The report suggests that serving the mass market through formal credit could unlock revenue pools of $25-30 billion by 2030. Additionally, wealth offerings have the potential to create another $30-40 billion in revenue opportunities.

According to the report, the affluent segment in India corners 70% of retail deposits and conducts 50-60% of the overall online spends.

This report comes at the same time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Union government will be extending the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY) for the next five years. The scheme provides free ration to 80 crore poor people of the country.

Several experts have pointed to India’s K-shaped recovery, which means that some parts of the economy are doing well, while others are struggling.

Take for instance, after growing about 25-40% year-on-year in the second half of 2020, consumer goods firms are now finding it hard to remain in the black, Business Today reported.

Mint reported that rural demand saw a sluggish recovery in the September quarter. It said that while volumes have improved sequentially in the September quarter, companies said the pace of growth has been slow. It added that growth also came on a negative base of the previous year when volumes dipped in mid-single digits.

An opinion piece, published on November 5, in Mint spoke about how Reserve Bank of India’s growth optimism overlooks rural distress.

“Rural demand never really recovered from the ravages of demonetization and the two COVID-19 waves. Other factors, such as unseasonal rains during April-June as well as erratic monsoons during July-September, have not only affected crop sowing patterns but dampened output and incomes. In addition, September inflation in rural areas has been higher compared with the urban areas: 5.3% versus 4.65%. The combination of higher prices, lower incomes and employment volatility has affected demand and consumption,” it said.

During the festive season, a surge in demand for FMCG goods, cars, and smartphones may indicate a revival in rural demand. However, it’s also important to take into account that four major companies recorded only a 0.7% year-on-year growth in two-wheeler sales. This contrasts sharply with the passenger vehicle market, where automotive manufacturers are posting record sales numbers, Business Standard reported.

Meanwhile, net financial savings of households have fallen to a nearly five-decade low of GDP in FY23."
"'Genocide in Palestine': Left Parties March in Kolkata, Question Indian Govt's Stand",https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/genocide-in-palestine-left-parties-march-in-kolkata-question-indian-govts-stand,"Nov 09, 2023  |  Joydeep Sarkar","Kolkata: Left parties in Bengal on November 8 hit the streets here to protest against Israel’s military operations in Gaza.

Thousands of people walked from Mahajati Sadan to Ramlila Park, demanding an immediate end to the conflict. The rally was attended by senior leaders including the Left Font chairman Biman Basu, the CPI(M) Bengal state secretary Mohammad Selim and the former Bengal state secretary, Surjya Kanta Mishra.

The march in Kolkata was a powerful display of solidarity with the people of Palestine and a call for an immediate end to the violence. Protesters demanded that the United States take action to stop the Israeli massacre and ensure a ceasefire. They also called for an end to all aid and support to Israel.

In a statement issued jointly by CPI(M), CPI, CPI (ML) Liberation, RSP, AIFB, MFB and the Workers’ Party, the Left parties criticised the Narendra Modi government’s stand on the US-Israeli military operation in Palestine, calling it a ‘de facto approval of the US-Israeli genocide’. In view of the impending visit by the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin to India, Left supporters will observe a sit-in protest across all the district headquarters of the state on Friday, November 10 from 2 pm to 4 pm.

Addressing the crowd before the march, the Left Front chairman Bose said, “The whole world is protesting. Protests are taking place all over the Western world. Kolkata has an anti-imperialist tradition. We are partner in the liberation struggle of Palestine.”

CPI(M) state secretary Mohammad Salim said, “India, which was the leader of the non-aligned movement, abstained from voting on the peace proposal in the United Nations. RSS is also dividing religion around war. They are propagating this genocide as a war between Jews and Muslims. Many Jews around the world are against this war.”

While several organisations have been holding rallies in the city on the plight of Palestinians, the ruling Trinamool Congress has so far maintained silence over this issue."
"India Improves in Tuberculosis Detection but Misses Major Death, Incidence Milestones",https://m.thewire.in/article/health/tb-tuberculosis-india-goals-detection,"Nov 09, 2023  |  Banjot Kaur","New Delhi: The Global Tuberculosis Report 2023, issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO), offered a mixed bag for India.

While India improved case detection for TB and was able to cover the losses made during the pandemic in this regard, it missed major milestones. India, incidentally, accounts for the highest TB burden across the world contributing 27% of all the TB cases followed by Indonesia (10%) and China (7.1%). The current report of 2023 gives figures on various indicators of TB for 2022.

For any country’s TB elimination programme, a major challenge is not to miss the cases and see to it that the majority of cases are registered or ‘notified’. A patient getting missed is not only harmful for the individual concerned but also her contacts as she might transmit the TB infection to them. So the governments across the world try to increase notification of new cases every year and close the gap between estimated TB incidence and vis-a-vis the number of cases actually newly notified.

According to the WHO report, India, Indonesia and the Philippines, which collectively accounted for a large share of the global reductions in the notification of newly diagnosed cases in 2020 and 2021 (the two pandemic years) – all of them recovered to above 2019 levels (pre-pandemic stage) in the year 2022.

These three countries themselves had reported losses in notification in the two pandemic years to the tune of 60%

A press release issued by the Union health ministry on the evening of November 8 also pointed out the ‘achievement’ and said, ” [India] reversed the impact of COVID-19 on the TB programme.”

As many as 13 countries, including India, according to the WHO report, which reported major case detection reductions in 2020 and 2021 rebounded to 2019 levels. However, the report also put a caveat to this achievement and its understanding.

It highlighted that some of the ‘rebound’ in the case detection numbers and reported as a ‘new case’ in 2022 could probably be ‘a sizeable backlog of people who developed TB in previous years [of 2020 and 2021].’

In other words, the improved case detection levels for 2022 might not be the new cases found in 2022 per se, but some of them which fell through the cracks in 2020 and 2021. The backlog could be a result of shutdown of all essential services, including TB services, in the two pandemic years, and therefore, their diagnosis got delayed.

As far as year 2022 was concerned, the WHO reported, 10 countries continue to account for more than 70% of the cases missed. India was the top contributor to this share as it accounted for 18% of such cases. It was followed by Indonesia, Philippines, Nigeria and Pakistan.

“From a global perspective, efforts to increase levels of case detection are of particular importance in these countries,” the report noted, highlighting the significance of improved diagnostic tools.

Major milestones missed

The Union health ministry’s release highlighted India’s success in reducing the TB incidence. “[The] efforts have resulted in reduction of TB incidence by 16% in 2022 (from 2015) almost double the pace at which global TB incidence is declining (which is 8.7%),” it said.

However, it did not say India, though just like many other countries, was far off target to achieve the targeted goal and the success was far from insufficient.

Incidentally, the WHO, 2018, had come up with some interim TB targets to be achieved so as to eliminate the world’s top killer by 2030. The interim targets are known as first ‘End TB Strategy’ milestones.

One of such targets was the cumulative reduction in the TB incidence rate in 2025 by about half as compared to the 2015 levels.

The press release said India could reduce the TB-related deaths by 18% in 2022 as compared to 2015 levels – almost at par with global reduction levels of 19%. However, this ‘achievement’, too, is far off the mark.

The WHO’s target was to reduce TB-related deaths from 2015 to 2025 by 75%. Going by the current pace, most of the countries, including India, will most likely miss this goal as well.

Other challenges galore

Drug-resistant TB continues to be a major concern for the world.

Resistance to rifampicin – the most effective first line drug against TB – is of greatest concern, according to the WHO. The form of TB that is resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid is defined as multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Both MDR-TB and rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) require treatment with second-line drugs, which is not only very expensive, prolonged but also leads to various other direct and indirect consequences.

Usually, a patient may become resistant to the first line of drugs during the course of TB treatment due to missing drug doses either due to stock-out of drugs or improper adherence to the medicine schedule. Some of the newly-diagnosed TB cases could also be that of DR-TB, as a resistant form of infection got transmitted from an infected DR-TB patient to an otherwise healthy person.

Three countries accounted for 42% of the estimated global number of people who developed MDR or RR-TB in 2022: India (27%), Philippines (7.5%) and Russia (7.5%).

The WHO in 2021 issued updated guidelines for diagnostics. It recommended that rapid molecular tests should replace the tradition sputum microscopy tests as the former have high diagnostic accuracy and help in early detection of TB or to understand if the patient is resistant to a drug.

Now, the current TB report reveals that, in India, less than 20% of all the notified cases were detected through the WHO-recommended molecular kits against the least target of 80%. Globally, 55 countries have achieved this target.

Expenditure on health, which is incurred out-of-pocket by patients’ households on their own, is a major deterrent in fights against all illnesses, including TB. If more than 10% of the annual household income is spent on treatment of any kind of illness, the WHO defines it as “catastrophic health expenditure”.

In India, according to the report, more than 20% of the 140 crore population in 2022 had to incur catastrophic expenditure on health, according to the report.

For TB, if the money spent on direct medical expenditures, non-medical expenditures and indirect costs such as income losses that amount to more than 20% of total household income, it is termed ‘catastrophic’. Globally, about 50% of all TB patients had to face this dire situation

While for India, the proportion of TB patients spending catastrophically on TB is not known, the WHO report highlighted that the percentage of TB patients facing such a situation is expected to be much higher than the percentage of the general population facing catastrophic expenditures on healthcare, for all the countries.

The current TB report also said India was able to reach the treatment coverage of 80% of all the estimated cases in 2022 – thus ensuring a large chunk of patients availed the medicine.

The WHO, in its current report also did a downward revision of TB mortality figures for India which was published in last year’s global TB report. Government’s press release alluded to the “newer evidence” that the Indian government shared with the WHO after the publication of its report. The WHO specified that it revised the figures owing to the new cause-of-death data that emanated from the country’s sample registration system.

According to the current report, 3,42,000 TB patients died in 2022 in India."
"33% Indian Women Can't Access Contraception: Outrage At This, Not Nitish Kumar’s Words on Withdrawal",https://m.thewire.in/article/women/nitish-kumar-withdrawal-contraception-women,"Nov 08, 2023  |  Abantika Ghosh","What constitutes an insult to the dignity of a woman? Ravaging her malnourished body to cause repeated pregnancies or talking about ways that she can avoid such a fate even when society and the government have failed in their duty to help her access contraception?

These questions are important when large sections of even the “liberated” are outraged over Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s graphic description of withdrawal as one of the means that an educated woman can make her husband practice in order to avoid unwanted pregnancies.

Giggling and blushing MLAs all around him – Kumar himself succumbs to a fit of laughter for a while – contribute to the trivialisation of an issue that has as much been India’s bane as the reluctance to address the root causes behind it without shame and manufactured outrage.

Sex is a taboo word in a country that produces 25 million children every year. Safe sex is anathema. Talking about it in the assembly is sacrilege!

National Family Health Survey 5 (data from 2019-20) says that only 66.7% Indian women have access to any method of contraception and just 56.5% have access to a modern method. (A modern method refers to sterilisation, contraceptive pills, condoms, intrauterine devices or injectable contraceptives.)

In Bihar the numbers are 55.8% for any method and 44.4% for any modern method.

Nitish Kumar’s description in the assembly is of withdrawal, a method where the man retracts before ejaculation. It is an accepted mode of contraception in any basic physiology textbook, albeit an unreliable one.

The total fertility rate – that is the average number of children that a woman would give birth to during her life time – stands according to NFHS 5 at 3 in Bihar while the national average stands at 2.2 which is just a notch above the replacement fertility rate of 2.1. Replacement fertility refers to a situation where the population stops actually growing as death and birth rates reach a balance.

For times immemorial governments in India have made family planning – euphemism for reducing births – their business. Yet if 33% Indian women and 45% Bihari women do not have access to any method of contraception that should be the cause for real outrage for all.

The squeamishness to talk about sex and the political backlash that anything akin to sex education invariably generates has given rise to a situation where Indian men get their sex education from pornography materials and women largely get it from life, learning the hard way about what can cause a pregnancy often ending up as unwitting victims of a system that is quick to punish them.

Unmet contraceptive needs lead to illegal abortions

The need for contraception and sex education go beyond the need of limiting family size which in itself is a multilayered proposition with implications on health, education, economic status etc of a family. It is a question of life and death.

In her seminal book Putting Women First based on her own gynaecology practice in Gadchiroli, Dr Rani Bang gives innumerable examples of women and girls – some of them as young as 13 – getting pregnant within weeks of menarche, sometimes not realising that they are pregnant till its too late to abort and then victimised by the tribal society for their “mistakes”. In a telling statement on what lack of sex education does to young people, Dr Bang recounts the tale of a young boy who wrote her a letter addressing her as “auntie” to talk about his own adolescent sexual insecurities and of a married couple who arrived at her clinic unsure about what constitutes the sexual act. She recounts countless cases in great detail of women and girls who had landed up at her clinic demanding an abortion past the legal timelines and then ending up either with an illegal abortion or worse still delivering an unwanted baby that is buried alive as per local practices.

According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)’s State of the World Population Report 2022. Between 2007-2011, 67% of abortions in India were classified as unsafe. Many of them happen first because of lack of contraceptive access and awareness, then because of lack of access to safe (and non judgemental) abortion facilities. Every day an estimated 8 women die in India because of unsafe abortions.

Dr Bang is one of the founding members of the Society for Education, Action and Research in Community Health (SEARCH) which runs a 100 bed hospital in Gadchiroli and has been a pioneer in many public health initiatives that have over the years been integrated into national programmes.

That women are acutely aware of the importance of contraception and often at a loss about how to access it was evident when Mewat – categorised as one of the most backward districts in the country – immediately after the inclusion of injectable contraceptives in the National Health Mission basket saw women turning up at the clinics for a shot, often without telling their families. The women told me they wanted to put a stop to the cycle of annual pregnancies in which many of them were caught and as the local health workers talked to them about options, that of getting a shot that would prevent pregnancies for a period of time, was a godsend.

If Nitish Kumar’s speech in the assembly gives women access to one more method of contraception, no matter how rudimentary and primitive, it is worth more than a few laughs. The outrage can be reserved for more deserving causes.

"For Disabled People in India, Securing Health Insurance Is Still a Difficult Task",https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/disabled-people-india-securing-health-insurance-difficult-task,"Nov 08, 2023  |  Yasmeen Saadi","New Delhi: Arman Ali, the executive director of the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP), secured health insurance in mid-October after a seven-year struggle.

Ali, who uses a wheelchair, is one of about 27 million people in India who live with disabilities.

The majority of the disabled population in India does not have access to affordable healthcare services, according to a statement issued by NCPEDP, an organisation that has been advocating for the healthcare rights of people with disabilities for years.

Securing health insurance is a significant step toward affordability. But in India, the higher the disability, the more difficult it becomes to gain insurance.

India uses a rating system to evaluate a person’s degree of disability. Per this system, Ali’s degree of disability is 80%.

Ali told The Wire that over the past seven years, he has made several attempts to apply for insurance, but was met with rejections and no explanations.

“I have gone through tests, given all my papers and documents, handed it back and forth, and they denied it and didn’t give me an explanation,” he said. “So that’s very painful. You don’t know where it’s going wrong, whether it’s your disability, whether it’s your health condition, and so on.”

Further, the lack of health insurance coverage for assistive technology like Ali’s wheelchair is a problem, globally.

The WHO Global Report on Assistive Technology said 2.5 billion people globally require assistive technology. It said that while data is limited, in Africa and Asia, surveys showed largely unmet needs, ranging from 25% to over 90% due to high costs, lack of financing, availability, awareness and a lack of trained personnel. These unmet needs are only heightened by the difficulty in getting assistive technology insured.

Ali finally secured insurance of Rs 5 lakh coverage through Star Health and Allied Insurance Co. Ltd, a private insurance company, and got his wheelchair insured under the all-risk cover policy of SBI General Insurance. He said that the coverage was a “momentous step forward”.

Ideally, his insurance would cover his assistive technology needs and services like rehabilitation and physiotherapy.

He said gaining insurance for his wheelchair instils hope and inspiration for the millions of people with disabilities and elderly people who use a variety of assistive devices for their activities of daily living.

He said he sent emails and letters to the managing directors and CEOs of 26 public and private general insurance companies, but received no response from almost 40% of the companies. Eventually, he received an offer from SBI General.

Poor response from government hospitals

Ali said that discrimination in accessing healthcare continues to be a reality.

He said in terms of response, government insurance companies perform the poorest. They did not get back to him despite multiple follow-ups from other organisations.

This, despite the Delhi high court saying that insurance products should be designed to enable people with disabilities to obtain health insurance coverage and that people with disabilities cannot be discriminated against.

Ali said he hopes to instil hope among many people by sharing the news of his health insurance coverage. He believes there’s an acute lack of awareness among disabled people.

“They don’t know how to navigate the process of obtaining insurance and it becomes a huge cost for the families and disabled people themselves,” he said.

Ali said this lack of understanding extends to insurance companies as well.

“There’s a need to build awareness [on insurance products for disabled people], and the government should also incentivise or come up with schemes that include all people with disabilities under Ayushman Bharat,” he said.

“The challenges around understanding blood disorders and insurance will not be resolved until and unless we build our understanding around it.”

In August, NCPEDP in collaboration with the National Human Rights Commission and Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDAI) held a stakeholders consultation with disability advocacy organisations in Mumbai where he said both private and government insurance companies were present."
"Despite INDIA Parties' Unease, Congress is the Ideological Counter to the BJP",https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/india-parties-unease-congress-ideological-counter-bjp,"Nov 08, 2023  |  Anand K. Sahay","What cannot be doubted is the ideological indispensability of the Congress party, especially its current dominant strain represented by Rahul Gandhi, in the contest against Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has hegemonised the national public space for a decade through disturbing religious mobilisations of the majority against the most significant minority community in the country.

But it is the results of the crucial state assembly elections, which kicked off on November 7, that will determine the extent to which the Congress’s undoubted strength on the ideas platform can be matched by the electoral and political force and momentum the party can generate.

Uttar Pradesh’s Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Akhilesh Yadav’s renewed broadside against the Congress this week – after failing to extract seats from it to contest in Madhya Pradesh where the Congress’s contest against the BJP is said to be very tight – going all the way to equate it with the BJP even in the foul ideological atmosphere of today could be an early pointer to the worsening dynamics within the INDIA bloc.

Can the rift be repaired in time for the Lok Sabha poll? If so, what would this take? Does the Congress need to fare worse than expected in the assembly elections, or better, in order to placate or satisfy some of its presumed allies?

The foundational Patna meeting of the opposition alliance of over two dozen parties in June, which the Samajwadi Party attended, could materialise only after the Congress bested the BJP in straight fights in Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka earlier this year, and wrested power from Modi’s party in both states. Since then, however, the INDIA bloc has encountered choppy waters.

And here is the contradiction, or the dialectic. If the Congress had lost in Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka, the regional parties that are afraid of the BJP would have simply cast it aside in their calculations as being of no practical use. So, a demonstrably strong or reasonably capable Congress is needed from their perspective too. But the question is, how strong? Regional parties, generally, are wary of a strong or even a resurgent Congress, thinking they might be upstaged by it in their own backyard, although this cannot be said to be a realistic anxiety at present.

In the past 12 months, the Congress not only beat the BJP comprehensively in two state elections – it did one better, something many thought unthinkable. The party held democratic internal polls after nearly a quarter century and elected as president the stalwart Karnataka Congressman Mallikarjun Kharge, whose stature and abilities had remained obscured principally on account of the politics of dynastic sycophancy that had plagued the Congress in recent decades.

Rahul Gandhi’s hand in helping bring about the change is undeniable, although to begin with few took him seriously when he declared that no one from his family was in the race for party chief. But the former Congress president – and dynasty beneficiary – played his role of disruptor to near perfection and in doing so triggered urges among the common people that were earlier far from discernible.

These urges especially brought out by the Bharat Jodo Yatra lay buried under bushels of communal propaganda fortified by the authoritarian agendas of the ruling dispensation, which talks up the leader all the time. Train and plane passengers are also not spared. The Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka voters were won over in spite of the communal and “the leader shows the way” propaganda.

Combined with the nationwide churning and mobilisation, the channelling of dissent and anti-regime sentiment produced by Gandhi’s Kanyakumari to Kashmir march, and the election of Kharge – whose political articulations and organisational clarity are widely credited for giving the Congress ballast as the party geared-up for state elections – can be said to be the high points of the year 2023, which has turned out to be an extraordinary one for the Congress.

But the point is, how is the year going to end? Channelling protests is all very well, but what will be the score-line on December 3 when results become available for the three key Hindi-speaking heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, besides Telangana and Mizoram? The social and cultural profile of North India can be said to be different from Karnataka where aggressive propagation of communal politics by Prime Minister Modi himself failed to sway the voter last April-May.

Akhilesh Yadav appears now to have put the Congress in the camp of an adversary rather than an ally. He is unhappy for not getting Congress backing for his party in Madhya Pradesh, where it has a marginal presence. The same is the case with the Aam Admi Party (AAP) of Arvind Kejriwal. Both SP and AAP are fighting in many seats in Madhya Pradesh.

The Janata Dal (United) of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar – who in the early stages was instrumental in drumming up support for the INDIA bloc by bringing the regional parties in step (or so it seemed) with the Congress – too has candidates in a handful of seats in Madhya Pradesh.

Nevertheless, speaking in Patna recently, he blamed the Congress for paying insufficient attention to the organisational aspects of the opposition alliance and focusing only on the five state elections.

Among the five states where assembly elections are being held, Madhya Pradesh is a different category from the rest. Here, the BJP risks losing power, the same way as it did in Himachal and Karnataka. A gain for the Congress here can boost the opposition for the Lok Sabha polls, for which preparations will commence shortly.

It is interesting that SP, AAP, and to an extent the JD(U), did not keep this in view. It is noteworthy in this context that the CPI and the CPI (M), whose request for accommodation in the three North Indian states, were also not considered by the Congress, have taken the situation stoically. Perhaps they have a different appreciation of the ideological stakes.

Whether the Congress – and more broadly INDIA in its extant shape at the end of the day – prepares the platform well for Lok Sabha 2024 will depend in good measure on the result of the five state polls. If the opposition goes below par, it can cease to entertain any hopes for the parliament election while the BJP can still hope to live to fight another day if it slides toward defeat in the ongoing state polls.

To that extent, it can be asserted that INDIA – the opposition alliance – was not conceived only for the Lok Sabha poll, although in his hubris – and a display of deplorable diplomacy toward a presumed ally – this is what the Congress leader Kamal Nath asserted while dismissing Akhilesh Yadav with a wave of the hand.

At various points in the post-Rajiv Gandhi era, the Congress has pondered its relationship with other opposition parties. The view at times has been to go it alone while at other times the value of teaming up with other parties has been considered. With the coming together of INDIA, it was felt that the grand old party was persuaded that taking on the gargantuan BJP of the Modi era would call for the widest possible mobilisation of opposition forces. Indeed, this seemed the message of Rahul Gandhi’s yatra.

While certain regional parties in the opposition alliance may be playing their games, and some may even be acting under remote guidance of the establishment since they may have been pressured by the coercive agencies, it is the Congress – rather than any other party – that may be called upon to summon the wisest moves once the state polls are done.

It has the most at stake in the survival of the constitutional system that we have. It must not lose sight of the fact that while regional parties fight the BJP politically to guard their turf, the Congress, for its survival and the survival of India’s constitutional democracy, has to take on the BJP both politically and ideologically.

Whither India’s Armed Forces: Politicisation by Default or Design?,https://m.thewire.in/article/security/india-armed-forces-politicisation-by-default-or-design,"Nov 08, 2023  |  S.G. Vombatkere","Before joining active service, an Indian soldier – all ranks of the Army, from jawan to General, and their equivalents in the Navy and Air Force – takes oath as follows:

“I will bear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of India as by law established and that I will, as in duty bound, honestly and faithfully serve in the regular Army of the Union of India and go wherever ordered by land, sea or air, and that I will observe and obey all commands of the president of the Union of India and the commands of any officer set over me even to the peril of my life.”

Thus, the soldier’s obedience is to the president of India and his loyalty is to the constitution of India.

While the serving soldier is governed by military law in addition to every other law which governs every citizen, certain fundamental rights available to every citizen are denied to him by Section 21 of the Army Act and the Army Rules “because of the nature of duties performed by the members of the regular Army and for the maintenance of discipline among them”. Specifically, Army Rule 20 prohibits “political and non-military activities”.

Over the decades, the command structure of India’s armed forces has preserved the highest standards of professional conduct and performance, and the apolitical character of the serving soldier.

Back in 1932, a Field Marshal advised young Indian Army officers:

“The young Indian man of education seems very attracted by politics. May I urge you to remember that politics do not, and cannot, find any place in army life. An army can have no place in politics. Once there is any suspicion that an Army, or any part of it, is biased politically, from that moment that Army has lost the confidence of the nation which pays for it. It is no longer impartial, and that way lies chaos and civil war.”

Public trust

A 2019 survey of public opinion relating to politics, society, and governance, revealed that people trust the Army the most, with the judiciary next. The least trusted are the police, government officials, and political parties.

India’s public recognises the apolitical nature of India’s armed forces, as a criterion for trust.

Soldiers on leave

The Army has the legacy problem of short-staffing of officers, and post-COVID-19, among personnel below officer rank. The Army has maintained operational capability and readiness, at the cost of increased stress during active service. It is established that stress is a prime reason for suicide among troops. Leave is a de-stressing, precious time away from the extreme rigours of service, when soldiers spend quality time with family and attend to matters that spouses were unable to do.

Ensuring soldiers’ leave is a responsibility of military commanders, essential for individual and unit morale, far more than a welfare measure or part of terms of service.

In this well-understood situation, the Army Headquarters directed – although the word used is “recommended” – that “every soldier proceeding on leave volunteers to choose any subject/domain as per own interest/competency and the felt need of one’s local community, and engages citizens, thereby making an individual contribution to the Indian Army’s nation-building effort”.

Short-staffed units are to provide soldiers with literature, to use for their “voluntary” efforts on social, civic and patriotic themes, such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, etc. The unit will monitor compliance using photographs and videos which the soldier takes. Pressure to comply will cause stress during leave, and anxiety on return to duty station, perhaps defeating the purpose of leave.

The soldier-on-leave “voluntarily” promoting government schemes can be negative for the Army’s morale and functioning.

Showcasing performance

On October 9, 2023, the Ministry of Defence directed defence establishments to set up 822 geo-tagged ‘selfie points’ in nine cities, to “showcase good works done in defence”, and “attract public attention”.

The armed forces are to set up and operationalise 100 ‘selfie points’ under government-defined themes of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and ‘Sashaktikaran’, and send “action taken reports”.

The scheme, using the armed forces to promote and advertise government policies, has an obvious political purpose.

Civil-military relations

India’s armed forces are subordinate to control by the Union government of the day. However, the government should consult the service chiefs (or the Chief of Defence Staff) before issuing directions such as soldiers-on-leave “volunteering” to promote government schemes, or establish “selfie-points” for the same purpose, because they impact the soldier and the service. It will never be known whether the government consulted the four-star top brass, or if consulted, what they advised the government.

Even earlier, the four-star top brass had complied with directions to arrange yoga mats on Raj Path (2015) for the government to set a world record, and clear garbage thrown by Himalayan pilgrimage tourists (2017). Both these tasks were within the ambit of duty and competence of other agencies.

Getting soldiers to do such tasks indicates the government’s step-motherly attitude towards the armed forces. Other examples are: death and disability benefits to soldiers made lower than for their civilian counterparts; denying non-functional financial up-gradation (NFU) to the armed forces although the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) receive it; and delaying the payment of OROP arrears ordered by the Supreme Court.

Politicisation

It is the duty of military top brass to convince the political leadership to not pass orders which are political in nature and intent, or impact adversely on the soldier and the service, and thereby on national security. This is easier said than done in the best of times, but under the present dispensation, it is much more difficult. Notwithstanding the difficulty, when the military leadership fails, the armed forces get politicised by default.

The government’s “soldier-volunteer” and “selfie-point” initiatives for political purposes are measures which politicise the armed forces, since the government cannot be unaware of the Army Act and Army Rules, which prohibit political activity.

Senior military veterans have expressed concern about the deleterious long-term impact of politics on the morale and cohesion of our armed forces.

Central and state governments prepare development plans and schemes to benefit the people, but advertising them is the ruling party’s political agenda. Soldiers promoting government schemes is unambiguously political activity. When it is ordered by the highest military authority in compliance with government directives, it politicises the armed forces. The government would do well to cease using the Army for political purposes, and the military top brass would do well to maintain the apolitical nature of the soldier and the service, in the interest of national security.

"For the Indian Armed Forces, the Era of Moscow-Supplied Platforms and Assets Is Ending",https://m.thewire.in/article/security/indian-armed-forces-russia-supplied-platforms-assets-era-end,"Nov 07, 2023  |  Rahul Bedi","Chandigarh: The phasing out last week of two Russian military aircraft types from the Indian armed forces inventory definitively presages the end of the era when Moscow-supplied fixed-wing combat, surveillance and transport platforms and assorted rotary-wing assets monopolised the catalogues of the country’s three services.

On October 31, the Indian Air Force (IAF) retired one of its three remaining upgraded MiG-21 ‘Bison’ fighter squadrons, the same day that the Indian Navy (IN) decommissioned, after 44 years, the last of its five Ilyushin IL-38 Sea Dragon long-range maritime patrol aircraft from the same epoch. The IAF also aims, by 2025, to superannuate its two remaining MiG-21 ‘Bison’ squadrons of some 40 fighters, all of which had been imaginatively exploited by three generations of fighter pilots.

The MiG-21s will be imminently replaced by the indigenous Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), while the IL-38s already have two substitutes in place: 12 Boeing P-8I Neptune long-range maritime multi-mission platforms and 26 German-origin turboprop Dornier Do-228s, licence-built by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in Bangalore with refurbished engines, composite propellers, advanced avionics and a glass cockpit. Another 12 Do-228 maritime variants were presently on order from HAL by the IN.

“There is now little or no likelihood of India acquiring any more Russian military aircraft,” declared a former three-star IAF fighter pilot. He said that other than intrinsic handicaps of low serviceability and crippling maintenance issues, Moscow’s previously questionable reliability in providing after-sales support, including spares, for its in-service aerial platforms had now ‘multiplied exponentially’ following US-led sanctions for invading Ukraine.

A cross-section of serving and retired military officers concurred that the ‘golden age’ of Soviet/ Russian aerial military platforms that began in 1963 with the induction of the single-engine, single-seat MiG-21FL ‘Fishbed’ fighters into the IAF, and was thereafter supplemented by a vast panoply of other platforms, was finally drawing to a close.

Even Russia’s defence industrial complex itself, for the first time after the imposition of sanctions 21 months ago, had publicly expressed its inability recently to continue delivering materiel to its many clients, including India, as it needed to ‘prioritise’ domestic military manufacturing to sustain domestic needs. Its unstated message signalled the urgency for Russian armament manufacturers to ensure uninterrupted equipment supplies to its armed forces to continue executing their deadlocked Ukrainian campaign.

In an October 19 press statement, Rosoboronexport, Russia’s dominant joint stock arms export corporation, admitted to currently facing ‘pressing challenges’. Consequently, in a departure from the past that focused primarily on exporting equipment, Rosoboronexport offered potential foreign partners alternate cooperative formats centred on technology partnerships. Military and defence planning officials in New Delhi fittingly interpreted this admission to signal the precipitous decline of Russia’s once gargantuan military industry which, almost single-handedly, armed India’s military since the 1960s, especially its aerial requirements.

The IAF’s transport fleet, for instance, earlier dominated by Antonov An-32s and Ilyushin Il-76, had undergone a significant makeover, with the induction of 11 Boeing C-17 Globemaster III and 12 Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 air lifters. Another 56 C295 MW medium transport aircraft from Airbus Defence and Space were on stream to replace the IAF’s legacy Avro-748M fleet, with 16 of them acquired in flyaway condition and 40 manufactured at a recently inaugurated facility in Vadodara, via a transfer of technology. And though some 100-odd An-32s continued in IAF service, their $400 million upgrade agreed with Ukraine in 2008, stands suspended after around 60 of them were retrofitted.

And, in early 2019, the IAF began replacing its dwindling fleet of 8-10 Mil Mi-25/35 attack helicopters with 22 Boeing AH-64E Apache equivalents that were acquired alongside 15 Boeing CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters. Both latter rotary aircraft were shortlisted after besting comparable Russian platforms in user trials. The Indian Army (IA) too is scheduled to take delivery in early 2024 of the first of six Apaches it had signed up to acquire in 2020 for around $500 million.

“India’s decades-old defence ties with Moscow have plateaued and are now on the downswing, especially with regard to military aircraft,” said Amit Cowshish, former Ministry of Defence (MoD) advisor on acquisitions. The materiel road for India, he added, now leads fortuitously to Western vendors and towards fast-tracking atmanirbharta (self-reliance) to indigenously develop weapon systems and platforms, or to a practical blend of the two, underscored by technology transfers.

That being said, Moscow undoubtedly takes commercial solace from the reality that some 60% of India’s overall in-service military kit was Russian in origin, even though Delhi’s materiel imports from Russia between 2017 and 2022 had dropped from 62% to 45%, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But the IAF, the IN and to a large extent even the IA remain heavily dependent on Moscow to technically support their swathe of Russian fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, which are expected to remain in service for at least two decades or more.

The most prominent amongst these were the IAF’s 260-odd twin-engine Sukhoi Su-30MKI (India) multi-role fighters and some 65 retrofitted MiG-29UPG air superiority combat aircraft that presently constitute the ‘sword-arm’ of the IAF’s combat squadrons. And, in September the MoD had, after extended deliberation, approved the procurement of 12 HAL-built Su-30MKIs as replacements for an equal number lost over years in accidents.

In the meantime, a cursory evaluation of the steady drawdown of Russian-origin aerial military platforms by the IAF and IN, in particular, is instructive.

In 2006, the IAF retired its fabled Cold War-era MiG-25 ‘Foxbat’ supersonic interceptor and reconnaissance platform, nick-named Garuda after the mythological bird-like creature from Hindu scriptures, whose purported activities were as mysterious and enigmatic as those of this aircraft.

Thereafter, in March 2007 it phased out some 120 MiG23MF/BN ‘Flogger’ air defence and ground attack variant fighters – christened Bahadur by HAL, followed 12 years later, in late 2019, by retiring its last upgraded MiG-27 ML ‘swing-wing’ combat aircraft, of which some 165 examples were licence-built by HAL. Around the same time, the IN bid farewell, after 29 years, to eight of its four-engine Tupolev-142MK-Es, possibly one of the best maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft of the Cold War years.

Furthermore, India has also bypassed Russia on recent aircraft contracts, with the MoD more or less scrapping the over $1.2 billion tender from 2014 for 200 Russian Kamov Ka-226T ‘Hoodlum’ light utility helicopters. Of these, 135 were intended for the Army Aviation Corps and 65 for the IAF, but over years of negotiations, the deal became mired in a myriad of insoluble complications over technology transfer to HAL and overall cost, and was abandoned.

The IAF was also sidestepping Russia in upgrading 84 of its Su-30MKIs to ‘Super Sukhoi’ standards, in its first retrofit tranche, by enhancing their overall operational performance, to keep them in service till 2045-50. Negotiations for the Su-30MKIs retrofit by HAL and a consortium of local vendors which includes upgrading some 51 of the fighters operating, offensive, surveillance and detection systems, but not their Al-31F engines were initiated with Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and Sukhoi Corporation in 2011, but these rumbled on for years, before being recently abandoned.

And in yet another telling indicator of the IAF’s disillusionment with Russian military aircraft, was its reported ‘unenthusiasm’ and ‘disinterest’ in even evaluating UAC and Sukhoi Corporation’s offer of MiG-35 ‘Fulcrum-F’ and Su-35 ‘Flanker-E’ for its proposed procurement of 114 multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA). Both Russian manufacturers had, alongside five other overseas original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), responded to the IAF’s April 2018 request for information or RfI for the planned MRFA buy to bolster its depleting fighter squadron numbers that had declined to around 29-30 from a sanctioned strength of 42 squadrons.

Senior IAF and industry officials are believed to have reasoned that for a variety of operational, availability and sustainability considerations, even evaluating the two fuel-intensive Russian fighter types for eventual acquisition, was ‘irrational and unworkable’, categorically precluding Moscow’s role in the lucrative contract. The other OEM responders to the IAFs MRFA RfI included France’s Dassault (Rafale), Eurofighter (Typhoon), Sweden’s Saab (Gripen-E) and the US’s Boeing and Lockheed Martin (F/A-18 and the upgraded F-21).

Conversely, the IN too was in the process of edging away from inducting Russian fighters into its new aircraft carrier’s combat air arm. Currently, it was in advanced negotiations to acquire 26 French Rafale (Marine) fighters for INS Vikrant, instead of supplementary Russian MiG-29K/KUBs, all of which had collectively proven operationally inefficient and hugely problematic since their commissioning into service from 2009 onwards.

The IN had acquired 45 twin-engine MiG-29K/KUBs between 2004 and 2010 for $2.29 billion but presently operated around 40, almost half of which were believed to be in reserve because of their dismal performance and inability to deliver their weapons payload to their stated range with a full fuel load. An excoriating analysis by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2016 had binned the MiG-29Ks, whose operational availability between 2014 and 2016, he revealed, fluctuated from 15.93% to 37.63%, whilst that of the MiG-29KUB dual-seat trainers hovered between 21.2% and 47.14%.

Revealingly, the IN is also believed to have halted negotiations with Russia to acquire 10 additional Kamov Ka-31 ‘Helix’ airborne early warning (AEW&C) helicopters for $520 million, approved by the MoD in May 2019, for deployment aboard Vikrant, following uncertainty in supplies over sanctions and attendant knotty payment mechanisms. These 10 Ka-31s were to have supplemented 10-12 similar platforms in service with the IN since 2003, all of which needed upgrading, that too was now imperilled by sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, the IN had acquired 24 Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky MH-60R multirole helicopters in a $2.6 billion deal agreed upon in early 2020, deliveries of which were ongoing, further diluting the navy’s once-prodigious Russian rotary wing assets.

In conclusion, Delhi’s druzhba or friendship with Moscow which sustained prodigious bilateral military commerce between the two, worth over $70 billion, seems to have run its course at the altar of newly emergent geopolitical configurations, encompassing a beleaguered Russia cementing close strategic, political, diplomatic, economic and, in time, even military ties with India’s feared foe Beijing."
"Global Rights Groups Urge FATF to Call on the Indian Govt to Stop Alleged UAPA, PMLA, FCRA Abuse",https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/fatf-review-international-rights-organisations-point-to-indian-governments-alleged-misuse-of-laws,"Nov 07, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","Mumbai: Recognising the alleged misuse of terror laws in India, several international human rights organisations have urged the global terrorism financing and money laundering watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to call on the Indian government to stop prosecuting, intimidating and harassing human rights defenders and activists.

The American Bar Association Centre for Human Rights released a report titled ‘The adverse impact of counter terrorism laws on human rights defenders and FATF compliance’, analysing India’s three major terror and money laundering laws – the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, and Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act.

Similarly, three rights organisations – Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Security Network – in a joint statement have pointed to the exploitative nature of the terror and money laundering laws in India.

In the statement, the organisations have accused the Indian state of restricting civic space and stifling the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.

“Draconian laws introduced or adapted to this end include the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Their actions have flouted both FATF’s standards and international human rights law,” the group claims in their joint statement.

The American Bar Association, in its 65- page statement, had pointed to the growing trend of non-compliance of the FATF recommendations.

“The report finds that India’s counter-terrorism laws have expanded over time, becoming increasingly vague, and often overturning basic procedural safeguards for defendants,” the report reads.

India joined the FATF, an intergovernmental body comprising 40 member countries that is mandated to tackle money laundering, terrorist financing and other threats to the integrity of the global financial system, in 2010.

In its first year, the Indian government itself had recognised the risk posed by the non-profit sector as “low”.

The international rights organisations say that things changed since the BJP government came to power in 2014. “The authorities have used overbroad provisions in domestic law to silence critics and shut down their operations, including by cancelling their foreign funding licenses and prosecuting them using counterterrorism law and financial regulations.”

The reports were compiled and presented days before the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation Review (MER) concluded on November 3. The MER was to evaluate the anti-money laundering laws and the financing of terrorism in India and the coalition.

The American Bar Association has pointed to five different case studies from recent years, including the Elgar Parishad and journalist Siddique Kappan’s cases, to show how terror laws have been misused to crack down on dissenting voices in the country.

In the report, the Bar Association says, “The case of journalist Siddique Kappan and his co-accused – of whom, two are student activists, and another a taxi driver – is one of the starkest illustrations of the misuse of terror funding laws for political means.”

Kappan was in prison for over two years from October 5, 2020, facing multiple charges under the UAPA and the PMLA. He has worked as a journalist for over a decade, and at the time of his arrest, he served as a contributing reporter for a Malayalam-language online portal and was also secretary of the Delhi chapter of the Kerala Union of Working Journalists.

In September 2020, Kappan was sharing a taxi with two others to follow up on a story in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras, where a Dalit woman was raped. She later succumbed to her injuries in a Delhi hospital.

Kappan’s family has insisted that his low-paying employment and lack of proficiency in the local language (Hindi) forced him to share a taxi with two others who were also travelling to Hathras to pay a visit to the victim’s family.

However, before they could reach Hathras, the three passengers and the driver were detained by the police and a petty case of breach of peace was filed against them. The next day, another first information report invoking far graver sections of the Indian Penal Code and UAPA were registered against them.

Kappan’s prolonged incarceration, however, came to an end on September 9, 2022, when the Supreme Court granted him bail.

In its oral observations, the apex court raised serious questions over the prosecution’s case that Kappan and others had planned to incite violence. Responding specifically to the state’s counsel that “provocative” literature, which sought justice for the Hathras victim, had been seized from Kappan, the then-Chief Justice of India U.U. Lalit said that “everyone has a right to free expression”.

In the Elgar Parishad case, too, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), under the BJP government arrested 16 rights activists and academics for their alleged role in Naxalite activities.

Over five years later, the trial is yet to commence. Even as the accused persons continue to languish in jail, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) moved an NIA court seeking to record the statement of Surendra Gadling, one of the first persons to be arrested in the case, for his alleged role in terror funding.

The ED claimed in its application that Gadling had used his and his family members’ bank accounts to raise terror funds and received funds through a “bank account under a fictitious name.”"
"What the Australian Court Order Asking Indian Ex-Diplomat to Pay A$136,000 to Domestic Help Means",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/australia-domestic-help-high-commissioner,"Nov 06, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: In a judgement that has far-reaching implications about diplomatic immunity and jurisdiction, an Australian federal court gave an ex-parte order asking India’s former high commissioner to Canberra to pay A$136,000 to a former domestic help for compensating her as per Australian standards.

According to a report by ABC News, Seema Sherghill arrived in Australia in April 2015, and spent about a year working at the high commissioner Navdeep Singh Suri’s official residence. She left the house in May 2016 and was granted Australian citizenship in 2021.

Neither the MEA or Suri, who had retired in 2019, took part in the court proceedings in Australia. There is no public statement from the Ministry, so far.

The single bench of Justice Elizabeth Draper observed, as per ABC News, that the “employment conditions bore no resemblance to what one would expect under Australian law”.

“Her passport was taken from her, she worked seven days a week, was never permitted to take leave and was only allowed outside the house for brief periods a day when looking after Mr Suri’s dog.”

The Judge also ruled that the Indian diplomat was ineligible to claim foreign state immunity, because Shergill did not work for the High Commission itself, nor diplomatic immunity, as the engagement of a domestic worker was not an official function of his position. She ordered Suri to pay Sherghill more than A$136,000 plus interest, within 60 days.

Shergill had earlier worked with Suri when he had been the Indian ambassador to Australia. She had travelled to Australia on an official passport with a diplomatic visa.

Devyani Khobragade

In December 2013, an Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade was strip-searched by US security officials on claims by her domestic help that she had not given her adequate compensation. It had led to relations between US and India nose-diving into a sudden crisis, before she finally flew back to India.

The MEA subsequently modified the system of India-based domestic assistants, who were no longer considered ‘personal helps’ but were employed by the Indian government.

As per sources, Shergill refused to sign an undertaking in May 2016 that was required from staff at all Indian diplomatic missions that they would return to India at the end of their three-year tenure. This was a new provision that was introduced in the aftermath of the post-Khobragade affair.

Since refusal to sign the undertaking meant cancellation of her contract and return to India, she was reportedly given several cautionary messages by the embassy officials. When she again refused, a ticket was bought by the High Commission for a flight to Delhi on May 27, 2016.

A day before her flight, she left the premises of the official residence, following which the Indian High Commission filed a ‘missing person’ complaint with the Australian Federal Police, as per informed sources.

ABC News quoted Shergill as stating that she was “responsible for doing everything” at the residence, known as India House.

“When he and his wife were away, instead of my usual chores, Mr Suri or his wife usually would ask me to make large batches of samosas and freeze them, or to clean the silverware,” she said.

She claimed to have worked seven days a week for 17.5 hours per day, with her official duties being cleaning the house, preparing meals and tidying the garden.

While Shergill claimed that she was not allowed to leave the house except to walk the dog, Indian sources claimed that she had remote access to the main gate to allow entry and exit of visitors.

Implications

Sources pointed out that the court judgment was based on the premise that Seema Shergill was employed in a private capacity in non-diplomatic household, which was inaccurate. They pointed out that she travelled on an official passport and that the Australian government had given her a diplomatic visa and identity card to show that she was in service at the High Commission of India.

Indian sources claimed that India-based diplomats and staff are paid salaries as per Indian scales and that this judgement was seemingly in violation of the Vienna Conventions of Diplomatic and Consular Relations. There was also concern, according to Indian sources, that the order would lead to service staff in Indian missions abroad to also seek compensation as per the local laws, as well as encourage others to take the path towards citizenship."
"Bad Kharif, Worse Monsoon: Inside India’S Food Security Doubts",https://m.thewire.in/article/agriculture/food-security-kharif-monsoon-inflation,"Nov 07, 2023  |  Indra Shekhar Singh","November brings doubts about the fate of India’s food security. Compare kharif production estimates for 2023-2024 with the deficit monsoon report for kharif, and match them with hyperinflation in food, price volatility and erratic rains, and something does smell fishy.

Once we read them together, one of them don’t seem to make sense, because India is largely a rain-fed agrarian system and a bad monsoon with extreme erratic rain events has a very high probability of dampening agricultural production, yet the crop estimates that paddy production dipped only 3.79% despite increased area under paddy cultivation. So the figures seem to be leading the reader astray.

But before diving into crop production, let us look at the monsoon. India is under the El Niño spell, which correctly points to irregular monsoon and probable drought-like situations. It was no surprise that August was almost drought-like, as cyclone Biparjoy showered excessive rainfall on western India, right before our traditional monsoon began. Then came a drought-like August, reporting the lowest rainfall in decades. September brought a little relief, but October again exacerbated the problems of farmers, especially in rain-fed areas. From Telangana to Kerala, the south experienced heavy rainfall deficits. Kerala had a deficit of 34%.

Along with the drought-like months, 2023 also witnessed 2,321 heavy rainfall events, with precipitation of 11.5-20.5 cm in 24 hours. The devastation caused by these events brought farming and even life to a standstill in many parts of the country. Areas of Himachal and Punjab are still reeling from flood and rain damage.

Apart from these, there were also 421 extremely heavy rain events, with precipitation over 20.5 cm in 24 hours, in 2023. Now, the IMD and the government are consulting their rain gauges and trying to say that it was a near-normal monsoon, but this is very far from the truth. The monthly average of rain could hide important agrarian gaps and can’t be trusted, especially for understanding agriculture.

All over India, farmers reported floods and drought-like conditions, especially when it was time to irrigate the kharif crops. After an early sowing due to government advisories and cyclone Biporjoy, kharif fields were left dry in August, putting a biotic stress on the crops. Farmers without irrigation suffered during this period.

In most agrarian clusters, erratic rains broke routine crop-growing cycles and untimely excessive moisture when it rained promoted the emergence of new pests and plant diseases, which farmers did not anticipate. The crisis in the supply of tomatoes and vegetables in early July-August bore testimony to this disruption. Rabi sowing is also being impacted as the retreating monsoon failed to get water to rain-fed areas. This problem is only increasing and we may be looking at a reprise of 2019, which featured extreme rainfall damage.

Now, let’s talk about food production. Keep in mind that kharif production and rain are deeply connected. Alarm bells started to go off in September, when the US Department of Agriculture predicted that Indian rice production would fall by 3% this kharif. Experts and the government brushed it off but recently, the government released kharif crop estimates and admitted that paddy production has fallen by 3.76% despite an increase in acreage. The government also stated that the “total kharif pulses production for 2023-24 is estimated to be lower than previous year due to climatic conditions. Total kharif pulses production during 2023-24 is estimated at 71.18.”

So, apart from rice, lentils are also squeezed. When we look at other food crops or cattle fodder, kharif has under-performed. Repeated spells of hyperinflation in vegetables doesn’t point to a regular kharif production cycle, either. The monsoon report also signals that, yet the crop production figures don’t correspond to the monsoon damages. If all the other signs are true, the crop production should be much lower than expected.

So if we compare IMD’s monsoon report and the agriculture ministry crop estimates, they don’t point to the same conclusions.

The question is, which one is more correct. If the monsoon data is correct, crop losses should be higher, and if the crop estimates are correct monsoon figures should have been much better.

The government wants to reduce public panic or another spell of food inflation and hoarding, and remains ambiguous on the real food situation while silently moving to implement stricter controls through import restrictions, close monitoring of food stocks and price controls, etc to check a food crisis before elections.

The recently released Global Hunger Index 2023 puts India at the 111th spot among 125 countries. For a couple of years, it has pointed to a steady deterioration of food security in India. Now with a bad kharif and uncertain rabi, Indians need to brace for more food troubles ahead. What is needed is transparency on food and weather data and stricter control on agri-processors and food warehouses, so that India doesn’t get trapped in a food speculation trap again.

"Israel Faces Manpower Shortage in Construction Sector, Looks to India to Replace Palestinian Workers",https://m.thewire.in/article/world/israel-faces-manpower-shortage-in-construction-sector-looks-to-india-to-replace-palestinian-workers,"Nov 06, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: Talks are underway between India and Israel over getting construction workers from India to work in Israel, to fill in the shoes of many Palestinians who are not being able to report to work in Israel following the start of Israel-Hamas war on October 7. The number being negoitated between India and Israel is around 15,000 workers, The Wire has learnt from sources in the know of things.

These talks, which are still in preliminary stage, is aimed at addressing shortage of manpower, as it is mostly Palestinians who work at the construction sites in Israel. Nothing so far has been finalised.

Since the start of war, Israel has barred the entry of Palestinians who constitute workforce of several sectors in the country.

Vice-president of Israel Builders Association, Haim Feiglin, told Voice of America News that Israeli construction sector has called on the Benjamin Netanyahu government to hire upto 1 lakh construction workers from India to take the place of 90,000 Palestinians whose work permits have been cancelled.

As The Wire reported earlier, in July this year, India-Israel had signed an agreement for 42,000 workers, out of whom 34,000 workers would be brought into the construction industry. If the latest talks come to fruition, the number of Indian workers who would go to Israel for work in the construction sector will be in addition to the previously agreed 34,000 workers.

Indian workers in Israel have been primarily involved in caregiving, accounting for a majority of the 18,000 Indian nationals in the West Asian country. The venture into the construction labour market in Israel has been relatively new for Indians.

Feiglin says pressure has been mounting on mayors in various Israeli cities to address the manpower shortage in the construction industry. It is mostly, for now, Chinese workers are filling in the shoes of Palestinian workers, but to a limited extent."
"‘Modiji, Silence Is Not Always Golden’: Protesters Say if Kukis Lose, Indian Democracy Will Lose Too",https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/modiji-silence-is-not-always-golden-protesters-say-if-kukis-lose-indian-democracy-will-lose-too,"Nov 06, 2023  |  Rohit Kumar","Hoinu is a first-generation learner. Born and brought up in Moreh, a small town in Manipur bordering Myanmar, about 110 kilometres from Imphal, she came to Delhi in 2012 to pursue higher education. She is currently pursuing an MPhil degree.

Hoinu was one of more than 2,000 members of the beleaguered Kuki-Zo community that staged a sit-in on November 3 at Jantar Mantar to express their anguish at the ongoing persecution they are facing in their home state.

A student of psychology, she understands trauma and has spent the last six months counselling and comforting her fellow Kuki-Zos in the National Capital Region, many of whom are battling severe anxiety and depression.

“When the violence first broke out in May, we, the Kuki students in Delhi University, couldn’t eat, sleep, or study. I couldn’t focus on my dissertation because I was so worried about my family back home. One student even tried to take his own life because he felt so guilty that he couldn’t be with his family in their time of need. I also feel homeless and uprooted because I haven’t been able to go back home for six months. The reason being that the road back home leads through Imphal valley which is now practically off limits for Kukis,” she said.

The sadness at the sit-in was palpable. A dozen people stood on stage holding posters of the Kuki-Zos who have been killed in the violence over the last six months, while those who knew the deceased shared stories about their lives and about how they had died.

On asking what has changed over the last six months in Manipur, Mary Grace, one of the founders of the Kuki-Zo Women’s Group, told The Wire, “Nothing has changed. The Meiti extremists have stopped the violence for a while to reorganise and train themselves, and now they have started attacking the Kuki people in Moreh again, the same way they did in Imphal valley six months ago.”

“At least back then, the Kukis could run to the army camps. Now, the Kukis are forced to stay in the forest and have no place to reside. Their houses have been robbed and looted,” she added.

Grace also offered a word of warning: “Please understand that this is not just about saving the Kuki people. It is about saving Indian democracy. We may only be seven lakhs in number, but if the Kuki people lose, India will also lose. This violence is just the beginning. Slowly, there will be no place left for the minority people in India.”

“In the same way that the majority Meitei community has subjugated the minority Kuki community, the same thing is going to play out in the whole of India. This is what is scaring me,” she said.

One couldn’t help but notice the huge number of Indian tricolours being held up at the sit-in. Also, unlike most street protests, where there is usually a limited repertoire of slogans and messages on display, the messages on the posters that nearly everyone in the audience was holding were unusual in both variety and length.

Even if no one had said a word on stage, the posters in themselves managed to tell the Kuki-Zo story of the last six months.

‘Kuki-Hmar-Zomi-Mizo Women’s Bodies are Not Battlefields. Stand With the Oppressed.’

‘End the Nightmare. End Biren’s Tyranny’

‘Selective Justice Is Injustice for Kuki-Zo’

‘Protect Indian Tribals From Anti-National Separatist Meiteis’

‘Hand Over the Dead Bodies of Tribals At Imphal Morgues To Their Families After Postmortem and Forensic Examination’

‘Forced Silence in Manipur. Modiji, Silence Is Not Always Golden’

‘Worship God, Not Genocide’

‘To Our Future Children – We Did Not Remain Silent. We Fought Hard For Your Tomorrow.’

The poster that perhaps best captured the bitter feeling of being forsaken read:

‘Yes, We Are Labelled Foreigners In Manipur But We Are Indians In the Land Of Our Forefathers. We Fought the British In 1917. We Are the Forsaken Children Of Netaji’s INA Soldiers.’

Activist and journalist John Dayal, one of the speakers at the event who had visited Manipur as part of a fact-finding team, soon after the violence broke out, gently corrected a previous speaker who had told the gathering that the victims of a genocide ultimately have to stand alone.

“While it is important to document every single case of wrongdoing, don’t lose your sense of community. Your community will not forsake you. Look at the anti-Sikh pogrom of 1984. The Sikh community rallied behind the victims, supported them, and brought many of the perpetrators to justice,” he said.

He referred to the persecution of Christians in Kandhamal in 2008, and the legal victories won by the victims there, and said, “Class cases and individual cases go hand in hand when you go to court.”

He drew parallels between the genocide in Gaza and the slaughter of Kukis in Manipur and reminded the audience and members of the civil society that it was important to keep calling out the complicity of the governments in power, best evidenced in the case of Manipur by the near-complete silence of the prime minister on the matter.

Also read: Narendra Modi Talked About the Manipur Violence. But Did He Really?

After talking to several high-ranking Meiti officials while in Manipur, Dayal said he realised that the name ‘Kuki-Zo’ was being obliterated.

Instead of calling them Kukis, the Meitei officials would instead refer to them as “illegal Kuki narco-terrorists”. In one breath, an entire section of the Manipuri society was now being labelled as ‘illegal migrants, narcotic peddlers, and terrorists’.

Despite the huge odds stacked against the Kuki-Zo community, Hoinu, the psychology student, hasn’t lost hope.

“We are going to strive as long as we are alive. This is now a matter of safeguarding our homeland. There will be some dark days, but the sun will shine again.”

State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks Against India Went Up by 278% Between 2021 and September 2023: Report,https://m.thewire.in/article/tech/state-sponsored-cyber-attacks-against-india-went-up-by-278-between-2021-and-september-2023-report,"Nov 06, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","While digitisation has accelerated the need for cybersecurity, India's cybersecurity regulations are weak and inadequate.

New Delhi: State-sponsored cyber attacks against India increased by 278% between 2021 and September 2023, with services companies, including information technology (IT) and business process outsourcing (BPO) firms, seeing the highest share of attacks, a new report has found.



During this period, targeted cyber attacks on government agencies went up by 460%, while startups and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) saw a whopping increase by 508%.

According to the 2023 India Threat Landscape Report by Singapore-based cybersecurity firm Cyfirma, India is the most targeted country globally, facing 13.7% of all cyber attacks, the Economic Times reported.

The US is the second most targeted country, with 9.6% of all attacks. Indonesia and China follow, with 9.3% and 4.5% of all attacks, respectively.

Cyfirma founder and chief executive Kumar Ritesh told ET that India is also experiencing a higher proportion of foreign state-influenced cyber attacks compared to the global average.

He said that globally, almost 68% of cyber attacks in the last three years were state-sponsored. “If you look at the India number, this is slightly higher, at 72%,” he said.

Cyfirma found that services companies, including IT and BPO, were at the receiving end of 14.3% of cyber attacks between March 2021 and September 2023. This was followed by manufacturing at 11.6%, and healthcare and education at around 10% each. Retail, including online platforms, saw 9.8% of attacks while government agencies saw 9.6%. Banking and financial services institutions, automobiles, and airlines saw 9.5%, 8.3%, and 6.1% of attacks, respectively, the business daily reported.

In 2015-16, 58-59% of cyber attacks on India were from Pakistani threat actors or operators from the Middle East, he told the newspaper. Today, only 6.4% of threats are from Pakistani actors or their affiliates, while 79% are from China, he added.

He said India needs a better enforcement of cybersecurity policies and greater awareness, especially among SMEs and startups, of the kind of sophisticated cybercriminals they are up against, Ritesh said.

“We as brand India are elevating ourselves, but it looks like cybercriminals are also elevating themselves because they know that we are becoming quite an influential force in the world ecosystem,” Ritesh said.

India’s cybersecurity weakness

While digitisation has accelerated the need for cybersecurity, India’s cybersecurity regulations are weak and inadequate.

Last year, on November 30, the website of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) faced around 6,000 hacking attempts in 24 hours.

This happened a week after five servers of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had been hacked by ransomware. An estimated 1.3 terabytes of data was encrypted. The hackers had made it impossible for AIIMS to access its own data.

On October 31, 2023, in a massive data breach, information of over 81.5 crore Indians with the ICMR were sold on the dark web.

Separately, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Technology Review CyberDefense Index (CDI) 2022/23 ranked India at No. 17 out of 20.

MIT’s CDI is the ‘first-of-its-kind’ annual comparative ranking of the world’s 20 largest and most digital economies on their preparation against, and response and recovery from, cybersecurity threats, another report in the Economic Times said.

“India struggles, despite a digitally forward government and the world’s largest IT-enabled service sectors. This powerful tech force lacks critical infrastructure, has poor national digital economy adoption, and weak cybersecurity regulation. Despite cyberattacks and calls for cybersecurity laws and a dedicated ministry, India has opted out,” ET quoted the report as saying.

The increasing number of cyberattacks has called for a cybersecurity law and the establishment of a dedicated ministry.

Experts have also pointed to the need for job creation in the cybersecurity industry.

Despite having the second highest number of active internet users after China, India represents only 6% of the global cybersecurity jobs.

Rajeev Sharma, CEO and CIO, Sysquark Technologies Pvt Ltd, an IT services company told the newspaper: “You would worry about theft when you have something to protect. Now think as a country instead of as a company. Companies will always have data to protect but they will always be short of resources. For a resource, security comes last in mind because he is busy doing firefighting. For a company, hiring more resources is not cost-effective since only a handful of customers are planning to buy the services/goods you are manufacturing. To strengthen the buying power, in turn, the cost-effectiveness of the resources, the first need is to create jobs. And I am purely talking from the government’s standpoint.”

“From the company’s standpoint, if we have a bigger coffer, we will be more interested in hiring resources who are specialised in the desired jobs. Cross-skilling is only a compromise on expertise. From a resource standpoint, since I have more time, I might like to learn new skills,” he added.

Moneycontrol has reported how India could fix its cybersecurity weakness. It said that the upcoming Digital India Act offers an opportunity to streamline and modernise India’s cybersecurity framework, addressing the existing gaps and inefficiencies."
Maldives Extends Invitation to India For New President's Inauguration Ceremony,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/maldives-extends-invitation-to-india-for-new-presidents-inauguration-ceremony,"Nov 05, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India has been invited to the inauguration ceremony of the new Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, scheduled to take place in two weeks.

Invitations were sent out to all “close partners” of the Indian Ocean island nation.

Last month, the opposition coalition leader Muizzu won presidential elections with a comfortable victory, stopping the incumbent Mohamed Solih’s re-election attempt in its tracks.

He won 54% of the votes in the presidential polls’ final run-off on September 30.

After the elections, there is a one-month long transition period which will end on November 17 with an inauguration ceremony.

President-elect Muizzu’s spokesperson Mohamed Firzul confirmed to The Wire that “invitations have been delivered” to foreign governments for the oath of office ceremony.

When asked if India and China were on the invitation list, he replied, “All neighbouring countries, close partners of [the] Maldives and multilateral organisations have been invited”.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended Solih’s swearing-in ceremony in November 2018.

While ministers and officials from 46 countries had attended the event, Modi had been the only head of government to travel to the Maldives.

That visit symbolised the relief felt in New Delhi following Solih’s election victory, as bilateral relations had deteriorated during Abdulla Yameen’s previous administration.

India was particularly concerned about Yameen’s perceived alignment with China and his actions, such as signing a free trade agreement with Beijing, having opposition leaders and supreme court judges arrested, and declaring a state of emergency.

Due to his conviction on corruption charges, Yameen was ineligible to run in the 2023 presidential elections. Instead, the opposition coalition nominated Muizzu, who was serving as mayor of the capital city, Malé.

It is not clear yet whether Modi himself will be going to the Maldives this time. Five states will be going to the polls this month for which he has a hectic campaigning schedule.

While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh will vote on November 17 (the latter state will also vote in a first phase on November 7), Rajasthan will vote on November 25 and Telangana on November 30.

The Indian PM has already declined an invitation from the United States to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco that ends on November 17.

Muizzu has also said that his immediate priority after taking over as president would be to ensure the withdrawal of Indian troops stationed in the Maldives. This had been a key promise of the opposition’s campaign platform.

During his meeting with Indian high commissioner Munu Mahawar, he had also asked for support from India on the country’s debt restructuring."
Four Factors That May Impact India's Projected Economic Growth of 6.5% in FY24,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/four-factors-that-may-impact-indias-projected-economic-growth-of-6-5-in-fy24,"Nov 04, 2023  |  Taniya Roy","New Delhi: India is projected to record an economic growth of 6.5% for the fiscal year 2023-2024. However, four factors – declining manufacturing activity, a slowdown in the services sector, rising unemployment, and air pollution – may have the capacity to impact this projected target.

PMI services at a seven-month low

India’s services sector experienced a slowdown in October, with the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) dropping to a seven-month low of 58.4 from 61 in September, according to a private survey.

The survey has attributed this decline to reduced demand, price pressures, and competitive conditions.

The survey polled around 400 companies in non-retail consumer services, transport, information, communication, finance, insurance, real estate, and business services.

It noted, citing anecdotal evidence, that while growth has been weakest since May, it has remained substantial, driven by customer interest and successful advertising. It added that fierce competition and subdued demand for certain types of services dampened the overall expansion.

Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the Indian service economy continued to register impressive growth, despite the increase in business activity and new work intakes softening from September’s over 13-year highs, Business Standard reported.

“Several companies managed to secure new contracts, but some mentioned subdued demand for their services and competitive conditions. Exports were an area of particular strength in October, with new business gains from Asia, Europe, and the US boosting growth to its second-highest in the series over nine-year history,” she added.

Manufacturing activity falls to an eight-month low

The slowdown in the services growth follows the decline in manufacturing activity in the last month.

Rising cost pressures and a decline in demand for consumer goods dragged down manufacturing activity in October, which grew at the slowest pace in eight months.

A recent Reuters poll showed demand during the festive season would bring some cheer to the economy, however, it would not be enough to ramp up the speed of economic growth.

Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, noted, “India’s manufacturing sector generated substantial growth in October, despite a challenging global economic environment.”

“Still, insights from surveyed purchasing managers pointed to the deceleration of several measures.”

The slowdown in both manufacturing and services indicates low production and productivity. That could mean that fewer goods are being produced and fewer jobs are being offered.

Unemployment at a two-year high

Separately, India’s unemployment rate rose to a two-year high of 10.09% in October, Bloomberg reported citing data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

However, the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data for July 2022 to June 2023 showed that India’s unemployment rate for individuals aged 15 and above has reached a six-year low, standing at 3.2%.



According to the PLFS data, a larger number of individuals are self-employed than those in casual labour and the regular salaried class.

“The share of self-employed [people] in the total workforce is increasing, and within that most of the increase can be seen among unpaid family labour and own account workers,” Santosh Mehrotra, professor of economics, Centre for Informal Sector and Labour Studies, School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, told The Wire.

He explained that people are choosing to be self-employed, because of a lack of good work and wages.

Economists have come to rely on CMIE data for a better assessment of the labour market as its figures are based on monthly surveys as opposed to government data, which releases country-wide data less frequently, Bloomberg‘s report said.

In May, CMIE chief Mahesh Vyas had told The Wire that India’s workforce is not rising in relation to its increasing working age population. He added India’s workforce has largely remained stagnant at a little over 400 million in the past five years, and that the quality of jobs in India is very low.

All these factors can have an impact on the Indian economy which is projected to rise by 6% to 6.5% this year.

Air pollution

“Air pollution has a direct, and a particularly debilitating impact on GDP growth and per-capita income levels by way of reduced worker output, lower consumer footfall in consumption-led services, hampered asset productivity, and a surge in health expenses and welfare allocations, especially in the productive age groups,” the Indian Express reported.

When we consider the consequences of recurring annual pollution cycles in key manufacturing and service centers, the strain on economic productivity becomes considerably more significant, the newspaper said.

A World Bank paper said there’s clear evidence that “the well-documented micro-level impacts of air pollution on health, productivity, labour supply, and other economically relevant outcomes aggregate to ‘macro level effects that can be observed in year-to-year changes in GDP’.”

“The effect is non-trivial – the median annual increase in the level of PM2.5 reduces year-to-year changes in gross domestic product by 0.56 percentage points,” the report said.

The Indian Express quoted an RBI report saying that the trend is a concern because in India, employment generation is still largely linked to economic activities involving the outdoors, such as in agriculture and construction. These two are among the biggest employment generation sectors. Delivery services and security agency work also account for the bulk of employment generation options in the urban areas, it said.

However, the impact of air pollution is not restricted to those working outdoors. “Even in indoor jobs such as those in call centres, air pollution takes a toll on productivity,” it said."
India's High Commissioner to Canada Says ‘No Relevant Info’ Provided Yet on Nijjar Investigation,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/no-specific-or-relevant-info-provided-says-indian-high-commissioner-to-canada-on-nijjar-probe,"Nov 05, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India’s high commissioner to Canada Sanjay Kumar Verma said that Canadian authorities have not yet provided India with concrete evidence of Indian involvement in Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s death.

“There is no specific or relevant information provided in this case for us to assist them in the investigation,” Verma was quoted as saying by Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail.

He added: “Where is the evidence? Where is the conclusion of the investigation? … I would go a step further and say now the investigation has already been tainted. A direction has come from someone at a high level to say India or Indian agents are behind it.”

Verma was referring to Canada’s allegations that Indian government agents were possibly behind the fatal shooting of pro-Khalistan activist and Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar near Vancouver in June.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly referred to the allegations in his country’s parliament in September.

Trudeau later said that his government had provided India with what he said were credible allegations “many weeks” prior to his statements in parliament.

Relations between the two countries have soured over the issue, and India ordered 41 Canadian diplomats to leave the country and temporarily suspended its visa operations in Canada.

India, which has accused Nijjar of being a terrorist, denies the allegations.

Officials in Canada reportedly intercepted communications between Indian diplomats that implicated India in Nijjar’s death.

But Verma told The Globe and Mail that conversations between diplomats are protected and cannot be released publicly.

“You are talking about illegal wiretaps and talking about evidence. Conversations between two diplomats are secure by all international law,” the newspaper quoted him as saying.

“Show me how you captured these conversations. Show me that someone did not mimic the voice,” Verma continued to say.

US ambassador to Canada David Cohen said that intelligence inputs from the Five Eyes network contributed to Trudeau’s decision to go public with the allegations against India.

More recently, Australia’s domestic spy chief Mike Burgess had said that there was “no reason to dispute” claims by Canada of Indian involvement in Nijjar’s killing.

Canada has not yet publicly revealed the information in its possession that led Trudeau to make public the allegations against India.

Indian external affairs minister S. Jaishankar previously said that India was open to looking at specific evidence were Canadian authorities to share any.

“We told the Canadians saying that look, if you have something specific, if you have something relevant, you know, let us know – we are open to looking at it, he was quoted as saying by the BBC.

Jaishankar and his opposite number in Canada Melanie Joly have recently said that they are in touch with each other.

“I feel that there is room for diplomacy here. I know that my counterpart in Canada has also expressed the same position. So, we have been in touch,” PTI quoted Jaishankar as saying.

India cited security threats to its missions in Canada when it suspended visa services in the country in September.

Soon after Nijjar’s death in June, Verma was named in a pro-Khalistan poster blaming the Indian government for Nijjar’s death and was called a “killer in Toronto”.

In his interview with The Globe and Mail, Verma said the threats against him were “hate speech” and an “incitement to violence”.

“I am concerned about my safety and security. I am concerned about the safety and security of my consul generals. God forbid if something happens,” he said.

But despite the downturn in relations, Verma told The Globe and Mail that India would like to expand business ties with Canada and that it would welcome a delegation of Canadian businesspeople to India.

He also said that a business deal between the countries that Canada suspended days before the G20 meeting in New Delhi earlier this year “should be signed as soon as possible so that traders and investors can take advantage of that”.

When asked by the newspaper what steps were needed to repair ties between the two countries, Verma said he did not oppose Canada’s investigation into Nijjar’s death but reiterated the Indian government’s stance that Canada must not let pro-Khalistan activities take place there.

“Don’t allow your soil to be used by a group of Canadian citizens who want to dismember India … Who want to challenge the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India,” Verma was quoted as saying."
"In Another Sign of Deep Economic Distress, Modi Says Free Ration to 80 Crore to Continue",https://m.thewire.in/article/government/in-another-sign-of-deep-economic-distress-modi-says-free-ration-to-800-million-to-continue,"Nov 04, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","Hyderabad: In poll-bound Chattisgarh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, November 4, said his government will extend Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, which provides 5 kg of free food rations every month to about 80 crore poor, by another five years.

The scheme was rolled out during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. “The free ration scheme’s tenure is going to be completed in December, but it will be extended for the next five years. This is Modi’s guarantee that the stoves will keep burning in the homes of my 80 crore countrymen, Modi said while addressing a rally in Durg in Chhattisgarh.

The statement by Modi is also an admission of prevailing hunger in the country, which was also captured by the Global Hunger Index 2023. The index ranked India 111 out of 125 countries, which is worse than its neighbours; Pakistan was at 102, Bangladesh 81, Nepal 69, and Sri Lanka at 60. While the rate of undernourishment in India, according to the index, stood at 16.6% and under-five mortality at 3.1%, the prevalence of anemia in women aged between 15 and 24 years stood at 58.1%.

After the release of the index, in the second week of October, the Modi government had rejected the index on the grounds of ‘methodological issues’.

It had described the ranking given to India as “erroneous and having malafide intent”.

Union women and child development minister, Smriti Irani, had dismissed the index by making remarks which opposition parties described as a “mockery of hunger” and called out her “insensitivity”.

“For instance, the Global Hunger Index that makes headlines now, many a people have said it’s all hogwash. How do they build that indice? 3,000 people in a country of 140 crore get a phone call from Gallup and they are asked, ‘Are you hungry?’

She then went on to say, “Now trust me, I have left my house in Delhi in the morning at 4 today. I got a flight at 5 to go to Kochi. I did a conclave there. Got a flight at 5 o’clock to come to this programme. By the time I get to anything called food, it will be 10 o’clock. If you would have called me anytime during the day today and asked from Gallup, “Are you hungry?” I’ll say, “Oh yes, I am.”

The Wire, in this piece, explains why Irani’s assertions on the hunger index are misleading.

PM Modi has been attacking Opposition parties on what he has termed ‘revdi culture’ but Opposition parties have hit back, with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal saying, “Some people are talking about revdi. When revdi is distributed among the public for free, then it’s called ‘prasad’ [devotional offering]. He added, “is given for free to your own friends, ministers, then it is ‘paap’ [sin]”.

Commandeering Civil Services and Armed Forces for Propaganda Could Make India a Failed State,https://m.thewire.in/article/government/civil-services-armed-forces-propaganda-india-failed-state,"Nov 03, 2023  |  M.G. Devasahayam","‘Propaganda’ is defined as “information, ideas, opinions, or images, often only giving one part of an argument, that are broadcast, published, or in some other way spread with the intention of influencing people’s opinions.” Its maximum application is in the political arena.

In the Indian context, political propaganda has been at its pinnacle in the past few years and almost the entire media – print, electronic, digital and social – has been virtually captured and conscripted to serve a political party and its supreme leader. Many institutions and instruments of democratic governance have been intruded and compromised. Now, civil services and the armed forces are being commandeered. On October 17, 2023 the Department of Personnel, Government of India instructed all ministries to nominate senior officers – joint secretaries, directors, deputy secretaries – as “District Rath Prabharis” under their purview to “showcase/celebrate achievements of the NDA government during the last nine years through “Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra” from November 20, 2023 to January 25, 2024. The yatra would traverse 765 districts in the country, covering 2.69 lakh gram panchayats.

Earlier on October 6, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had subpoenaed the armed forces to promote the Union government’s achievements in various fields. As per the directions issued, the armed forces will create 822 geo-tagged ‘selfie points’ in public places across the country to “showcase good works done in defence” in a manner that “enables the people to get the feeling of being a part of the initiative.” The additional director general (media and communications), MoD issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which recommends that “the ‘selfie points’ may contain a giant-sized picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” Another order was issued by the MoD on October 9, 2023 instructing soldiers on annual leave to promote government schemes, designating them as “soldier-ambassadors.”

This extraordinary commandeering of civil services and the armed forces for propaganda at one go is obviously aimed at creating a positive public perception of the BJP government in general and Prime Minister Modi in particular on the eve of general elections to parliament, due in April-May, 2024. Looked at from several dimensions, this is a dangerous move.

First is the federal dimension. Article 1 of the constitution says ‘India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.” The core objective of the constitution was to ensure national unity and integrity while at the same time performing the task of socio-economic reconstruction through democratic means. To achieve this purpose and to meet the special needs of India, the constitution framers developed a sui generis variation of federation. The constitution incorporates federal features such as the distribution of powers between the Centre and the States: 97 matters are on the Union List; States have exclusive powers on 66 matters contained in the State List; and the Concurrent List consists of 47 items. The constitution envisages India’s governance as a joint venture between the Union and state governments. But of late, the Union government has launched an assault on the federal structure of the constitution by attempting to capture areas and subjects which are within the domain of the states. This commandeering of civil services and the armed forces to trumpet the “achievements” of the Union government and the prime minister directly to the people would further worsen the situation and accelerate Centre-state tension and friction.

Second is the code of conduct. Under Rule 5(1) of the Civil Services Conduct Rules, 1964, no government servant shall take part in, subscribe to, aid of or assist in any other manner, any political movement or activity. Engaging members of any of the central civil services in the Rath Prabhari campaign, which is clearly political in nature, would therefore infringe the Civil Services Conduct Rules. “Rath Prabhari” itself is a political (mainly BJP) parlance and not that of civil service. Considering that the idea underlying this campaign exclusively revolves around the BJP government’s so-called “achievements” during the past nine years, inevitably, it has a political connotation that cannot be wished away. Had the campaign covered the entire post-independence period as we celebrate the Diamond Jubilee, it would have been a different proposition.

The third dimension is the grave impropriety of it all. Civil servants and soldiers are not BJP cadres. Just as there is separation of powers between the judiciary, the executive and the legislature in the constitutional scheme, there is a clear line of separation between governments that come and go in a democracy, and the bureaucracy, which is permanent. The bureaucracy’s role is to conceive, design, plan, implement and supervise policies and programmes of a government. Its job is not to do propaganda for the same, since another government voted in by the people has the right to change the policies and programmes of one government. The ‘Rath Prabhari’ programme envisaged by the present government is clearly a political programme intended to publicise its claimed achievements a few months before the 2024 general elections. This amounts to misusing government machinery for election purposes.

The fourth dimension is the core electoral code of a level playing field, which is critical for the conduct of free and fair elections. The Election Commission of India (ECI), no doubt, has directed the government not to conduct the campaign in the states (Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Chattisgarh and Mizoram) where the Model Code of Conduct has come into effect due to assembly elections. Otherwise, the ECI has no problem with government servants openly participating in this political propaganda on the eve of parliament elections in 2024. This is a grave dereliction of duty by the ECI. The commission should have stopped this serious distortion of the electoral code and level playing field by invoking its plenipotentiary powers and the far-reaching judgment of the Supreme Court in the Mohinder Singh Gill vs Chief Election Commissioner (1978):

“… but where such law is silent, Article 324 of the Constitution is a reservoir of power to act for the avowed purpose of not divorced from, pushing forward a free and fair election with expedition…”

And “free and fair election” is a part of the basic structure of the constitution.

Politicisation of armed forces?

Now coming to the brazen politicisation of the armed forces and the ‘selfie points’ that have already come up in some places. The SOP lays down the themes based on the government’s catchphrases including Atmanirbhar Bharat, Sashaktikaran, Nari Shakti, digitisation etc. Look at the tearing hurry of the MoD to execute the scheme. Directions were given on October 6, execution to commence “immediately” and action taken report to be submitted by October 11.

“Is it the execution of a routine scheme or ‘all-hands-on-deck’ to identify national defence, particularly the armed forces, with the political party in power,” asks the distinguished soldier Lt Gen H.S. Panag (Retd)!

This move by the government violates Rule 20 (1) of Army Rules (1954), which says that no person subject to the Army Act shall take part in any activity held for political purposes. Also, the SOP suggesting that the ‘selfie points’ may contain a giant-sized picture of the prime minister is questionable because as per Article 53(2) of the constitution, the supreme command of the defence forces of the Union shall be vested in the president of the Republic, not the prime minister.

A former Chief of Naval Staff was emphatic when he said that this programme “should never” have been contemplated and would have a negative long-term impact on the forces. He said:

“I am not quite clear about the concept underpinning the “selfie points” programme, but with the general election looming, any endeavour which even remotely involves the armed forces with political influencing, can only ring alarm bells. The MoD should never have contemplated this, and one hopes the military leadership will explain the deleterious long-term impact of politics on the morale & cohesion of our professional forces.”

What else can one expect from a political dispensation hungry for power, and whose top leader in 2019 described the Indian Army as “Modiji ki sena” and the ECI did not lift a small finger, despite strong protests by ex-servicemen?

It is intriguing why the present ruling dispensation – with its massive propaganda machinery like a large political party, RSS and affiliate associations, IT Cell and a pliant media – should commandeer the civil services and the armed forces for the purpose. A question arises: Is there a credibility crisis?

Be that as it may, we call Pakistan, which gained independence one day before us, a “failed state” mainly because of its hijacking of the civil services and politicisation of the armed forces. Is India heading that way? As it is because of the brazen crony capitalism the country resembles a “failed state” as defined by Robert Rothberg in the seminal book, When States Fail: Causes and Consequences:

“Failed states offer unparalleled economic opportunity-but only for a privileged few. Those around the ruler or ruling oligarchy grow richer while their less fortunate brethren starve… The privilege of making real money when everything else is deteriorating is confined to clients of the ruling elite… The nation-state’s responsibility to maximize the well-being and prosperity of all its citizens is conspicuously absent, if it ever existed…”

Commandeering of India’s civil services and the armed forces for political propaganda, thereby severely denting their independence and integrity, will only hasten the process.

Nearly 60% Of Healthcare Organisations in India Hit by Cyberattacks in Past Year: Report,https://m.thewire.in/article/tech/nearly-60-of-healthcare-organisations-in-india-hit-by-cyberattacks-in-past-year-report,"Nov 03, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","India was ranked the third-worst country, following the US and Brazil, for cybersecurity risk events in the first half of 2023, according to Trend Micro’s 2023 report.

New Delhi: Nearly 60% of healthcare organisations in India have suffered a cyberattack in the past 12 months, the Economic Times has reported, citing a new study by Sophos, a UK-based cybersecurity firm.

Of these, cybercriminals were able to successfully encrypt data in nearly 75% of ransomware attacks – the highest rate of encryption in the past three years, the business daily reported.

This is a significant increase from the 61% data encryptions carried out last year, ET reported, citing the cybersecurity firm’s study.

In comparison, only 24% of healthcare organisations were able to disrupt a ransomware attack before the attackers encrypted their data. This, per the report, has fallen from 34% in 2022. This is also the lowest rate of disruption reported by the sector over the past three years, it added.

Last year, on November 30, the website of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) faced around 6,000 hacking attempts in 24 hours.

This happened a week after five servers of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had been hacked by ransomware. An estimated 1.3 terabytes of data was encrypted. The hackers had made it impossible for AIIMS to access its own data.

On October 31, 2023, in a massive data breach, information of over 81.5 crore Indians with the ICMR were sold on the dark web.

But why is the healthcare sector becoming a new target for data breaches?

Outdated software, legacy systems, and inadequate investments in cybersecurity has worsened the situation, Raj Sivaraju, president APAC, Arete, a cyber risk management firm, told Hindustan Times.

As India moves towards digitising the healthcare sector, it has increasingly become important to secure the online systems.

India was ranked the third-worst country, following the US and Brazil, for cybersecurity risk events in the first half of 2023, according to Trend Micro’s 2023 report.

The cyber threat landscape

What’s even more concerning is that Indian firms cannot prevent almost half of cyber attacks, said a report by Columbia-based cybersecurity company Tenable.

The report is based on an online study of 825 IT and cybersecurity professionals, of which 69 were Indians.

“In today’s threat landscape, by the time organisations react to cyberattacks, the battle is half lost,” Tenable India country manager Kartik Shahani told news agency PTI.

This is due to the lack of coordination between the IT and cybersecurity teams, a challenge acknowledged by 43% of Indian organisations, per the report.

The misalignment in goals between IT and security teams in organisations results in a palpable lack of synchronisation, making it challenging to work cohesively toward a shared goal, Shahani said.

As many as 78% of Indian respondents believe their organisations could better defend against cyber attacks with more resources dedicated to preventive cybersecurity. However, only seven in 10 (71%) organisations say their IT teams are more concerned with uptime than patching and remediation, the report said.

A high cybersecurity skill gap

Moreover, India’s cybersecurity industry faces a massive demand and supply gap.

Despite having the second highest number of active internet users after China, India represents only 6% of the global cybersecurity jobs.

There were only 40,000 job openings in this industry as of May 2023, Business Standard reported.

While there’s a growing demand of cybersecurity professionals in India, the industry is facing a major skill challenge, with the demand-supply gap standing at 30%, the report said.

According to the report, India’s cybersecurity workforce stood at around 0.3 million in 2023, up from 0.21 million in 2022, and 0.1 million in 2021. In comparison, the global workforce of cybersecurity professionals stood at around 4.7 million.

In terms of cybersecurity revenues, India is generating an estimated revenue of $2.50 billion out of the global revenue of $222 billion, it added."
"5x Hike in Undocumented Indian Immigrants to the US, Nearly 97,000 Caught Over Past Year: US Data",https://m.thewire.in/article/society/5x-hike-in-illegal-indian-immigrants-to-the-us-nearly-97000-caught-over-past-year-us-data,"Nov 03, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: A staggering 96,917 Indians were apprehended while crossing into the United States, without documentation, between October 2022 and September 2023 according to the US Customs and Border Protection (UCBP) data.

Of the nearly 97,000 Indians, 30,010 were caught at the Canada border and 41,770 at the frontier with Mexico, a Times of India (TOI) report said. The rest were tracked down after they entered US territory.

While this marks a fivefold increase from over 19,883 Indians caught the year before, the actual numbers could be significantly higher as these figures are based only on recorded cases, law enforcement agencies pointed out.

“This is just the tip of the iceberg. For every person caught at the border, there may be at least 10 others who successfully infiltrated the US,” a police officer in Gujarat told the paper.

“These are mainly people from Gujarat and Punjab who have aspirations to settle in America,” another police officer probing immigration rackets in Gujarat said.

Those arrested are classified under four categories — unaccompanied children, children accompanied by family members, and entire families. Single adults make up the largest category.

According to the UCBP data, 84,000 single adults and 730 unaccompanied children were apprehended at the US border this year.

The number of people opting for risky routes into the US has shot up in the wake of the pandemic-era border policy, ‘Title 42’, that allowed US authorities to deport undocumented immigrants without asylum hearings.

Senator James Lankford on Thursday (November 2) said, “So far this year we’ve had 45,000 people from India that have crossed our southern border, paid the cartels, crossed into our country, and said they have fear in their country from India.”

He added that Mexican cartels are “coaching” people on what to say and how to game the American system while seeking asylum.

According to a 2019 report from an American think tank, undocumented Indian immigrants to the US, numbering over half a million, hold a collective spending power of $15.5 billion and contribute $2.8 billion to the federal, state and local tax revenue. This makes them the top third contributor to the US economy among other undocumented immigrants, the report said.

Despite several reports of tragic incidents involving families attempting to cross the border without documentation, people continue to take up hazardous routes into the US, the TOI report said."

Labour economist Professor Santosh Mehrotra tells The Wire’s founding editor M.K. Venu that the unpaid workers’ number has growth from 40 million in 2017-18 to 95 million in 2022-23.

He says the ILO does not define unpaid workers as employed and this system is followed in 92 countries. In India unpaid workers are about one-third of the self employed category.

And self employment itself has grown from 52% of the total employed in 2017-18 to 58% of the total employed in 2022-23. This has led to a big surge in the army of unpaid workers who join small family run shops or vending units due to lack of real employment opportunities.

Mehrotra also says that a lot women and youth have joined the army of unpaid workers in recent years.

The other critical data in the government survey is that average monthly wages are more or less stagnant between 2017-18 at Rs 19,450 and in 2022-23 at Rs 20,039. This shows virtually no growth in average wages in 5 years, reflecting on the worsening quality of employment.

This again ties in with the growing army of self employed and within that the increasing unpaid workers. Their lack of purchasing power, especially in rural areas, is also clearly manifested in the lack of growth in rural demand for consumer companies like Hindustan Lever, Bajaj Auto, etc. in recent years."
"'Insecure Institute of India': IIT-BHU Students Livid at Disrobing, Molestation of Student on Campus",https://m.thewire.in/article/women/iit-bhu-sexual-harassment-student,"Nov 03, 2023  |  Omar Rashid","New Delhi: Students of the Indian Institute of Technology (Benaras Hindu University) in Varanasi on Thursday, November 2, demonstrated in large numbers after a 20-year-old student was allegedly molested on campus by three motorbike-borne men. The IIT-BHU student who was molested said that the three unidentified men forcibly kissed her, then disrobed her and clicked videos and photos of her.

“Are we safe?” and “Insecure Institute of India,” read some of the placards held by the outraged students who turned up in hundreds to register their protest against the incident and shouted slogans. Safety on the campus has been an issue of continuing concern.

The IIT-BHU falls within the larger BHU campus, which is spread over 1,300 acres (5.3 square km) and is one of Asia’s largest residential campuses.

While the students demanded better security arrangement, including a closed campus, opposition parties targeted the BJP government for the poor law and order, with Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wondering, in a post on X, whether it was “no longer possible” for a female student in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi “to walk fearlessly inside her own educational institution.”

Ambushed

The incident, according to the student’s complaint, happened when she, along with a male friend, had stepped out for a walk near her hostel at around 1:30 am Thursday.

The student said that around 300-400 nears the Karman Baba temple in the campus, a bike carrying three people ambushed her and her male friend from behind. The men separated the two and dragged the girl to a corner while covering her mouth, she alleged.

The miscreants then forcibly kissed her, disrobed her and clicked videos and photos of her, she said.

“When I screamed for help, they threatened to kill me,” the student said in her police complaint. The men held her for 10-15 minutes and secured her phone number before letting her go. The student hid in a professor’s residence nearby fearing a repeat of the attack.

An FIR was lodged against three unidentified persons under assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe, criminal intimidation and relevant sections of the Information Technology Act.

‘Not the first time’

The IIT BHU Students’ Parliament, a body of the students on campus, said the “heinous crime” had shaken the “very fibre of the institution.”

“It is also not the first time such an incident has occurred on campus. Students have repeatedly raised concerns about security on campus, but the administration has failed to take adequate action,” the student body said.

The IIT BHU students staged a huge protest against the incident and demanded that the administration carry out night barricading to restrict entry of outside vehicles inside the campus with a single point of entry and exit, set up a centralised CCTV system, escalate legal action against violent offenders, increase CCTV infrastructure and take immediate on-ground and legal action on such incidents.

The protest went on till late on Thursday, forcing officials to take action and issue assurances to the agitated students.

Indeed, this is not the first time that students in BHU have staged a protest against an unsafe campus for girls and women.

In 2017, BHU students staged a dharna in the campus against the alleged victim-blaming of a female student who was molested by two unknown persons while she was returning to her hostel. Even though there were security guards stationed at a distance, the fine arts student did not receive any help and was instead snubbed with misogynist remarks and shamed for walking in the dark. The 2017 protest came under focus after the police carried out a lathi-charge on the protesting students.

In February this year, students staged a protest after a differently-abled student was allegedly molested by a youth, the son of a BHU academician, on the pretext of offering her a lift.

‘Admin attitude puts blame on girls’

In 2022, the Bhagat Singh Students Morcha even submitted a memorandum to the chief proctors highlighting the unsafe conditions in the campus, which is not only poorly-lit but also porous and accessible to outsiders as it is in the midst of dense population.

“The IIT-BHU incident was not an isolated one. Every other month we come across such cases of sexual harassment. Most girls don’t even report it,” Ipsita, a student associated with the BSSM, told The Wire.

She said the administration lacked sensitivity towards the issue. “Their attitude is always that it is the girls who are at fault,” she said.

‘Committee to submit report’

Later on Thursday, IIT BHU administration informed the protesting students that the Commissioner of Varanasi had apprised them that he had discussed with the Ministry of Education about construction of a boundary wall of the institute campus. A joint committee of CPWD officials and an IIT-BHU professor will be constituted and entrusted with the task of surveying the campus for construction of a boundary wall to augment its safety, the IIT-BHU Registrar said.

The committee will submit its report within a week. The Varanasi Commissioner also said that CCTV cameras would be installed at all sensitive locations including girls’ hostels at the earliest.

The IIT-BHU administration also decided to restrict movement of vehicles within the campus from 10 pm to 5 am by putting barricades at specified locations and deploying additional security at sensitive places.

The security of the institute would be jointly monitored by the district police and IIT-BHU personnels at all the seven gates, while four police personnel including a sub-inspector would be permanently positioned in the chief proctor office of the institute to take necessary action.

The institute also said it would actively pursue with the Ministry of Education and the university administration for creation of a closed campus with restricted entry."
ED Summons to Kejriwal a Ploy to Destroy INDIA Bloc Ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha Polls: AAP,https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/ed-summons-to-kejriwal-a-ploy-to-destroy-india-bloc-ahead-of-2024-lok-sabha-polls-aap,"Nov 02, 2023  |  Ajoy Ashirwad Mahaprashasta","New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) summons to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in the excise policy case has turned into a huge political row between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Kejriwal skipped the ED’s questioning on November 2 and chose to spend the day canvassing in the poll-bound Madhya Pradesh.

AAP alleged that the central investigative agency was being used by the BJP to finish off opposition forces who had come together to form the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA). AAP leaders have indicated that the summons to Kejriwal, and arrests of deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, and Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, are a preface to a possible series of such action against top leaders of INDIA bloc parties.

The BJP, on the other hand, has used the opportunity to dismiss such claims by AAP.

Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad told the press that the action against AAP leaders, including Kejriwal, is part of a legal process and that the BJP’s political interests have nothing to do with it. He attacked AAP which, he alleged, has been caught in a loop of corrupt dealings while implementing the excise policy. Prasad said that the case exposes the hollowness of AAP’s anti-corruption posturing, while also dismissing the INDIA bloc as an “opportunistic” alliance.

The crux of the saffron party’s attack, while detailing the ED case against AAP leaders in the excise policy case, has been to brand the Kejriwal-led party as a corrupt force.

Sambit Patra, BJP spokesperson, hammered down the point that the ED case has proven that AAP – a party that claimed to be “kattar imaandaar (absolutely honest) – has been exposed as “kattar beyimaan and kattar besharam (absolutely corrupt and shameless)”. Patra defended that the summons were sent to Kejriwal after the ED had taken all available evidence into account.

The BJP’s attack on AAP mostly hinged on the recent Supreme Court order that denied Sisodia bail in the liquor policy case, even as it kept bringing up Kejriwal’s decision to ally with INDIA parties that it had previously called corrupt.

Yet, the ED summons to a sitting chief minister have transformed into a debate around the Union government’s alleged misuse of central agencies for political gains, and has brought back attention to the INDIA coalition ahead of the upcoming assembly polls.

The alleged misuse of central agencies

Over the last two days, AAP leaders like Raghav Chadha, Gopal Rai, and Saurabh Bhardwaj have taken turns to liken the ED summons, and the Thursday morning (November 2) raid on Delhi cabinet minister Raaj Kumar Anand in yet another case of alleged money laundering, with an overarching attack on opposition. They claimed that such action against opposition leaders was “vindictive” and reflected the BJP’s nervousness after the INDIA bloc was formed.

Kejriwal shot off a response to the ED, urging the agency to withdraw the summons. He argued that the summons were at the BJP’s behest, and therefore, were “illegal and politically motivated”.

Thereafter, Rai defended him, saying that the ED’s letter didn’t clarify whether it was addressed to the Delhi’s chief minister, or AAP’s national convenor, or Kejriwal as a normal citizen.

Rai said that it was clear that the ED summons were at the BJP’s behest, as even before the ED had responded to Kejriwal’s decision to skip the questioning, the BJP had already responded at the agency’s behest and listed out details regarding why Kejriwal was summoned.

Kejriwal, while canvassing in Madhya Pradesh’s Singrauli, said that the summons to him was a threat that he keeps receiving from the BJP’s quarters. He added that AAP has shown that it was possible for a government to develop schools and better healthcare for the poor.

“The Delhi government has shown that it is possible. But the BJP will not do any such thing wherever it is in power nor will it allow anyone to work for the poor,” Kejriwal said.

A rather well-rounded criticism of the ED summons was advanced by Chadha. The Rajya Sabha MP from Punjab said that the summons to Kejriwal was a possible ploy to eventually arrest Kejriwal to wipe off the primary opposition in Delhi and Punjab, so that the BJP has it easy in the Lok Sabha polls next year.

He added that the possible arrest of Kejriwal will be the first in a “series of such arrests” to shut out the top leadership of the INDIA parties.

In a detailed press briefing, he said that after the arrest of Kejriwal, it will be the turn of the Jharkhand chief minister, Hemant Soren; deputy chief minister of Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav; top leaders of the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal; the chief minister of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan; ministers in the M.K.Stalin-led Tamil Nadu government; and big opposition leaders of the Maha Vikas Agadi, the opposition alliance in Maharashtra. He said the vindictive action by the BJP will also be taken in this order.

He argued that the BJP was anxious after the opposition parties decided to come together despite their differences.

Chadha said that if INDIA becomes successful in fielding one united candidate against the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections, the saffron party’s defeat is certain.

“Our sources gave us concrete inputs that the BJP has hatched a plan to arrest all top INDIA bloc leaders before the Lok Sabha polls. The plan is to arrest all top leaders of INDIA parties, with a belief that if top opposition leaders are in prison, there will be no one to steer the opposition campaign. It is a dangerous plan that violates all tenets of democracy,” Chadha said.

He said that such a pattern was there for everyone to see. Almost all top opposition leaders across most states, including Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Manish Sisodia and Tejashwi Yadav, were facing different unsubstantiated charges, on which the agencies initiated action only in the run-up to different elections.

“It is clear that the BJP and the Narendra Modi government want to keep the opposition leaders busy in legal hassles than spend time campaigning,” he said, adding that almost 95% of the ED cases in recent years have been against opposition leaders.

The furore over the summons to a sitting chief minister has provoked other opposition parties too in raising their pitch against the BJP, and relate this episode with an overarching attack on INDIA parties. The Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s general secretary Sitaram Yechury brought up the recent notifications that many opposition leaders received from Apple regarding a possible “state-sponsored attack” on their iPhones.

“This anti-INDIAn government needs such surveillance and snoop raj to dig a deeper and bigger hole under Indian democracy, eventually to destroy it,” Yechury said.

Barring the Congress, which is still undecided on whether to treat AAP as an ally or its rival, most other INDIA constituents have protested against the ED move to summon a sitting chief minister.

Given how a majority of INDIA parties have reflexively raised the pitch against BJP on alleged misuse of central investigation agencies over the last few months, the issue is likely to remain a burning matter of discussion in the run-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls."
Unemployment Rate Rose to Two-Year High of 10.09% in October: Report,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/unemployment-rate-rose-to-10-09-percent-in-october-cmie-data,"Nov 02, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India’s unemployment rate rose to a two-year high of 10.09% in October, Bloomberg reported citing data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

That figure represents a near-three percentage point increase from September, when it was 7.09%.

Bloomberg added that rural unemployment jumped from 6.2% to 10.82% and that the urban employment rate “eased slightly” to 8.44%.

According to government figures, the unemployment rate for 2022-2023 stood at 3.2%.

But economists have come to rely on CMIE data for a better assessment of the labour market as its figures are based on monthly surveys as opposed to government data, which releases country-wide data less frequently, Bloomberg‘s report said.

India’s economy was projected to rise by an impressive 6% to 6.5% this year.

The population is also growing and India overtook China as the world’s most populous country in April.

But despite this growth, India’s workforce has remained stagnant for the last five years, CMIE chief executive Mahesh Vyas told The Wire.

Close to 10 million Indians entered the job market in October hoping to find work, Bloomberg cited CMIE data as saying.

A survey by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies found earlier this year that 36% of Indians aged 15 to 34 thought that unemployment was the biggest problem facing the country.

When compared to a similar survey conducted in 2016, the proportion of Indians who identified unemployment as the biggest problem increased by 18 percentage points, the Indian Express reported the survey as saying.

As many as 40% of educated respondents (graduate and above) identified unemployment as the biggest challenge, as opposed to only 27% of non-literate individuals doing so."
Can the Modi Government’s Schemes Bring About Transformative Change in Rural Livelihoods?,https://m.thewire.in/article/government/can-the-modi-governments-schemes-bring-about-transformative-change-in-rural-livelihoods,"Nov 02, 2023  |  Deepanshu Mohan, Aditi Desai, Amisha Singh, Shilpa Santhosh, Vasudevan, Aryan Govindakrishnan and Jheel Doshi","This is the second in a two-part explainer by the CNES InfoSphere team from its latest edition, as part of its special research series on Arthvyavastha: Measuring the State of the Indian Economy. To review InfoSphere’s research work, please view its website here.

The first part of this series helped explain the nature of concerns affecting India’s macro and micro rural performance indicators from a lower disbursement and budgeted ratio of fiscal priorities weighted by the Union government during its elected term.

A lower fiscal outlay and disproportionate rate of disbursement for schemes applicable have contributed directly to the poorer functioning of certain schemes, including those like MGNREGA which have been around for long and have been instrumental in providing some job security for an otherwise underemployed rural population across states.

We look here at the performance of some more schemes under the Modi government and the factors that play a role in contributing to developmental prospects.

Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)

PM-KISAN Yojana aims to supplement the financial needs of the farmers in acquiring various inputs to ensure proper crop health and appropriate yields and generate equivalent expected income for the farmers. This nationwide scheme was announced in the 2019 interim budget of India.

All small and marginal farmers would receive Rs 6,000 per year in three payments, which will be put directly into their bank accounts under this initiative. The Union government would fund the total yearly expenditure for this initiative.

The programme’s benefits are now available to all farmers nationwide without the need for intermediaries through a farmer-centric digital infrastructure that upholds complete transparency in beneficiary verification and registration.

As of August 2023, the Government of India has disbursed over Rs 2.60 lakhs crores to more than 11 crore farmers. In the last financial year i.e. 2022-23, a total amount of Rs 58,201.85 crore was disbursed to eligible beneficiaries.

The above graph depicts a substantial increase in the number of farmers receiving benefits from the programme. Since its inception in 2019, the number of beneficiaries has increased dramatically, from 3 billion to 30 billion by 2021. Notably, data for the 2022-23 fiscal year were only available through November 2022, which may explain the lower beneficiary count for the 2022-23 fiscal year.

The main concern for the scheme is the underutilisation of the allocated funds.

The above graph demonstrates conclusively that the government has consistently underutilised the allocated funds for the programme. Except for 2021, the government consistently underutilised the allocated funds. A budget overrun in 2021 was primarily attributable to the necessity of meeting the requirements of farmers during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The above chart shows that the government made efforts to address the issue of underutilisation but still confronts an average rate of 24% of the budgeted amount.

Factors shaping rural development patterns across India

Firstly, literacy rate trends have a major impact on rural development scenarios. A higher literacy rate, especially amongst girls in rural areas, has been responsible for the improved performance of many public health statistics and over time helped rural youth get absorbed in higher-paying, and better-condition employment opportunities.

According to NSS reports, the literacy rate in rural India increased from 68% for males and 43% for females in 2000 to 72.3% for males and 56.8% for females in 2014. Between 2003 and 2014, rural literacy grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 3.42%.

In 2021, the literacy rate stood at around 73.5% in rural India, including 81% for males and 65% for females. The government of India has launched many initiatives such as Samagra Shiksha, Jahawar Navodaya Vidyalaya, mid-day meal schemes, etc. to increase the enrolment rate and also to encourage the already enrolled students to attend regularly, leading to a rise in literacy rates.

Still, rural India requires a strong infrastructure, including roads, communication channels, electricity, drinking water, irrigation, drainage, and adequate housing.

As per Census 2011, 45% of rural households do not have electricity connections and depend on kerosene and other means for lighting and merely 30% of rural areas are covered with tap water supply.

In addition, the sanitation facilities in rural areas are also not adequate. As per the road statistics published by the Union government for 2012-13, rural roads span 60.39 km of every 100 km. Further, the rural surfaced road is just 33% of the total rural road network in India and the remaining are kutcha roads which are highly vulnerable and inaccessible, particularly during the rainy season.

Various schemes and initiatives are being undertaken by the current government including the Jal Jeevan Mission which aims to provide functional household tap connection to every rural household by 2024. As of December 31, 2019, road length worth Rs. 2.9 lakh crore had been sanctioned and expenditure of Rs. 2.17 lakh crore was incurred. The vision for 2025 is for 100% of the rural population to have access to pucca houses with basic civic amenities such as piped drinking water, power supply and LPG connections.

Government policies have helped to develop rural India, creating new job opportunities. One such initiative is TRYSEM, or Training Rural Youth for Self-Employment. It aims to train young people in technical skills so that they can start their businesses.

Multi-pronged strategies are being taken by the Government to address issues relating to employment opportunities through centrally sponsored schemes likeMGNREGS, Deendayal Antyoday Yojana- National Rural Livelihood Mission, Deendayal Upadhyay- Gramin Kaushalya Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.

The government launched the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan (GKRA) of 125 days on June 20, 2020 to boost employment and livelihood opportunities for returnee migrant workers and similarly affected persons including youth in rural areas, in 116 selected districts across Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The Abhiyaan has achieved an employment generation of 50.78 crore person-days with a total expenditure of Rs 39,293 crore.

The rise of mass media, such as television, social media, and radio, has increased awareness among rural people. With mobile phones and the Internet, they can now search for jobs, learn new skills, and connect with people outside of their village. This has also made them more aware of different government schemes that can help them with farming and other activities.

The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), which is responsible for agricultural research, helps understand how crop yields are affected by different atmospheric and soil conditions, and how fertilizers can be used to increase production leading to the overall development of the rural areas.

From 2014 to 2023, ICAR has been able to release 2,764 varieties of field and horticultural crops including 123 bio-fortified varieties. It has enhanced export-oriented production of horticultural crops and gene modifications to explore improved resistance to biotic/abiotic stresses. ICAR was able to develop 28 eco-friendly pest management modules and. 53 multi-enterprise integrated farming systems (IFS).

In summation

India’s root is still habituated in the heart of its villages even though, paradoxically, its cities power the growth story. The appropriation of rural populations’ hard work has become a cost-benefit advantage for urban areas to source cheap migrant worker bases. One can see that while analysing the growth of construction, or MSMEs too.

Upon assuming office in 2014, the Modi administration instilled considerable optimism on the prospects of rural reform and the lofty objective of doubling the earnings of farmers. Nevertheless, in 2019, the development achieved was not in line with the initial expectations.

However, a considerable segment of the rural voting population maintained a sense of optimism and adopted a cautious stance, expecting that the government’s subsequent term in office would yield the desired transformations they longed for.

Road construction and better connectivity have helped remote areas to be better connected than before but rural livelihoods, and access to basic amenities, including better education, healthcare, or employment, remain a distant goal. This has negatively impacted the upward mobility promise that (new) governments bring with them when they expect to be voted back to power.

Programmes like MGNREGS have brought a tangible difference to the rural economy and contributed to its growth rates, but require more funding and expansion. What has been observed is a reverse effect in the support for these – and more centrally budgeted schemes – in the Modi government’s second term.

Fiscal insecurities are driving this, but a lack of intent and will to bring a transformative, long-term change in rural livelihoods will not only affect the aspirational hopes of the current generation but also the future ones.

The Modi Government Has Underperformed in Developing the Rural Economy,https://m.thewire.in/article/government/modi-government-underperform-developing-rural-economy,"Nov 01, 2023  |  Deepanshu Mohan, Aditi Desai, Amisha Singh, Shilpa Santhosh, Vasudevan, Aryan Govindakrishnan and Jheel Doshi","This is the first in a two-part explainer by the CNES InfoSphere team from its latest edition, as part of its special research series on Arthvyavastha: Measuring the State of the Indian Economy. To review InfoSphere’s research work, please view its website here.

As India gears up for its next national election cycle, a special series of macro data analyses by the Centre for New Economics Studies’s InfoSphere team aims to study the performance and state of the Indian economy as part of its operational dynamics across different contributing areas and sectors.

The first edition of this series looks at the performance of the rural economy from the data made available.

As a broadly agrarian economy, rural India plays a critical role in different community-based cooperative setups, including self-help groups anchored by women which thrive across districts and villages to contribute and shape the rural growth story.

For decades now, “agriculture” alone has contributed close to 16.40% of the Indian GDP in its overall sectoral composition. In the post-COVID-19 economic scenario, much like urban areas, the rural consumption demand rates faced a declining trend, too, which was closely linked to the nature of the expenditure patterns in the urban households, witnessing a persistent decline.

However, the slumbering trend in rural consumption was offset by the increasing temporal rural demand for goods and services, due to a better-performing agrarian production cycle when monsoons were better on average and more workforce was engaged in agricultural production. This happened especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the rural economy contributing temporarily on the consumption front, there are structural issues that are endemic to rural populations. These range from high rates of unemployment and under-employment rates to higher malnutrition, and severe infrastructural gaps that hamper the growth and development of the rural economy vis-à-vis the urban landscape. The Modi government has tried to improve the welfare distribution system of public goods and services in rural areas through different centrally funded schemes, but the results have remained mixed at best.

How does rural development cater to macro growth?

Rural income is a key driver of rural demand, which has ripple effects on a wide range of industries, including fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), automobiles, housing, and other retail aspects. Increased consumer spending in rural areas fuels rural demand, creating a virtuous cycle of economic growth.

As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 5, there was significant improvement in the rural sector during the survey period (2019-21) compared to the previous survey between 2015-16. The quality of rural lives, ranging from electricity to sanitation facilities has improved drastically, leading to rural women’s empowerment through SHGs. The government has implemented various schemes for rural development leading to economic growth which include the following four flagship programmes:

Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) Jal Jeevan Mission Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)

MGNREGS

The MGNREGA, passed in September 2005, gives a legal guarantee of 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to adult members of a rural household who demand employment and are willing to do unskilled manual work. The objective of the Act is to enhance the livelihood security of the people in rural areas by generating wage employment through works that develop the infrastructure base of that area.

Under MGNREGA, a total of 11.37 crore households availed of employment and a total of 289.24 crore person-days employment has been generated till December 15, 2022. A total of 289.24 crore person-days employment had been generated between January 2022 and December 2022, followed by 5.38 crore households availing of employment between April and December 2022.

The major achievements of MGNREGA include GIS-based Planning of Gram Panchayats (GPs), National Electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS)/DBT, Implementation of Geo-MGNREGA, Emphasis on Social Audit and Cluster Facilitation Project (CFP).

The new initiatives under the scheme include Amrit Sarovar, which called for the construction/renovation of at least 75 ponds in each district of the country. The Jaldoot app measures the water level in a gram panchayat through two to three selected open wells twice a year, and an ombudsperson is aimed at smooth reporting and categorisation of grievances. A total of 505 ombudspersons have been appointed.

The graph illustrates a consistent trend in which the demand for jobs under the scheme consistently outpaces the actual number of jobs provided. From our analysis, it is evident that there has been a 41% increase in the job demand, while the number of jobs provided increased by 38%. A 3% difference can appear to be insignificant, but when viewed from the perspective of the entire population, it becomes substantial.

The graph above illustrates an increasing annual gap between the demand for government-provided positions and the supply. This can be attributed to the declining budget allocations for the programme, as shown in the graph below. Consistent reductions in the government budget allocations have contributed significantly to the scheme’s inability to create the promised number of jobs. The graph below depicts an 18% decrease in the budget allocation compared to the previous fiscal year.

Jal Jeevan Mission

The Jal Jeevan Mission is envisioned to provide safe and adequate drinking water through individual household tap connections by 2024 to all households in rural India.

The programme seeks to implement source sustainability measures as mandatory elements, such as recharge and reuse through greywater management, water conservation, and rainwater harvesting.

As of October 19, 2023, the Jal Jeevan Mission states that 13.37 crore (69.5%) of 19.23 crore rural households have household tap connections. It also states that all rural households in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Telangana, and Goa have tap water connections.

The above graph indicates a clear distinction between the funds allocated and funds released by the Union government. The funds released by the Union government are lower than the funds allocated for the scheme. From 2020, only around 50% of the allocated budget is released for the scheme. We can also see the upsurge in allocation from 2021. This is primarily done to alleviate the difficulties faced by rural households due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This graph indicates that the share of expenditure from the Union government and states had remained almost constant till 2020, but improved drastically from 2021, to address the issues that had arisen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It could be seen that central and state expenditures improve more in 2022. This might be one of the vote bank politics techniques to increase the vote share from rural India in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. There is a high probability of stagnation of expenditure from the state and the Union government.

This graph indicates the percentage utilisation of government funds. It shows that the utilised funds have reduced over the years. The fund utilisation has reduced from 75% in 2015-16 to 61% in 2022-23. In 2021-2022, when the government expenditure surged significantly, only 50% of the funds were utilised.

Implementing schemes such as these requires careful planning and structuring, which is often overlooked by states to achieve quick results that have long-term consequences for the beneficiaries of these schemes, who in certain instances are completely unaware of the schemes in the first place. The Union government should implement a stringent framework to assess the on-ground implementation of these schemes and hold accountable all defaulters whose aim is solely to forge numbers.

"Apple Warns Top Indian Opposition Leaders, Journalists About ‘State-Sponsored’ Attack on Phone",https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/apple-india-state-sponsored-spyware,"Oct 31, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: Multiple top leaders of India’s opposition parties and several journalists have received a notification from Apple, saying that “Apple believes you are being targeted by state-sponsored attackers who are trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID ….”

Here are the people confirmed to have been notified by Apple about the attempts to compromise their iPhones:

1. Mahua Moitra (Trinamool Congress MP)

2. Priyanka Chaturvedi (Shiv Sena UBT MP)

3. Raghav Chadha (AAP MP)

4. Shashi Tharoor (Congress MP)

5. Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM MP)

6. Sitaram Yechury (CPI(M) general secretary and former MP)

7. Pawan Khera (Congress spokesperson)

8. Akhilesh Yadav (Samajwadi Party president)

9. Siddharth Varadarajan (founding editor, The Wire)

10. Sriram Karri (resident editor, Deccan Chronicle)

11. Samir Saran (president, Observer Research Foundation)

12. Revathi (independent journalist)

13. K.C. Venugopal (Congress MP)

14. Supriya Shrinate (Congress spokesperson)

15. Multiple people who work in Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s office

16. Revanth Reddy (Congress MP)

17. T.S. Singhdeo (Chhattisgarh deputy CM and Congress leader)

18. Ravi Nair (journalist, OCCRP)

19. K.T. Rama Rao (Telangana minister and BRS leader)

20. Anand Mangnale (regional editor, South Asia, OCCRP)

The email titled “ALERT: State-sponsored attackers may be targeting your iPhone” goes on to say, “These attackers are likely targeting you individually because of who you are or what you do. If your device is compromised by a state-sponsored attacker, they may be able to remotely access your sensitive data, communications, or even the camera and microphone.”

It urges the recipients, “While it’s possible this is a false alarm, please take this warning seriously.”

While the language of Apple’s warning is identical to what the phone manufacturer has used in the past to alert victims of spyware around the world, the fact that at least five persons in India received the same alert at the same time (11:45 pm on October 30, 2023) suggests those being targeted are part of an India-specific cluster.

In a statement on Tuesday, Apple said, “Apple does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker.”

These threat notifications were enabled by the company in 2021, and since then such notifications have reportedly been sent to individuals in nearly 150 countries.

Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi has tweeted the mail.

Wonder who? Shame on you.

Cc: @HMOIndia for your kind attention pic.twitter.com/COUJyisRDk — Priyanka Chaturvedi🇮🇳 (@priyankac19) October 30, 2023

Moitra also took to Twitter to highlight the alert:

Received text & email from Apple warning me Govt trying to hack into my phone & email.

– get a life. Adani & PMO bullies – your fear makes me pity you.

Khera too shared the message he got from Apple on X and asked, “Dear Modi Sarkar, why are you doing this?”

“Glad to keep underemployed officials busy at the expenses of taxpayers like me! Nothing more important to do?” Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said while posting about the attack.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi held a press conference on the matter, in which he accused the Narendra Modi government of doing everything possible to hide that they had “sold the government to Adani”. “Hack us all you want,” he said, “but we will not stop questioning you.” He also said that the government is going out of its way to distract from demands from a caste census. “Who is Adani really stealing from?” he asked, and responded that it was the common people, the marginalised, who were paying the price.

The others whom The Wire can confirm have received the warning from Apple are well-known people who are open critics of the Narendra Modi government.

“The reports of threat notifications from Apple need to be taken very seriously and require investigation to determine the source and the extent of the malware attack. Given Indians – especially journalists, parliamentarians and constitutional functionaries – have also reportedly been targeted with Pegasus in the past it is a matter of deep concern for our democracy,” Prateek Waghre, policy director of the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) told The Wire.

IFF’s founding director Apar Gupta posted on X to explain why these cannot be called “false alarms”.

“Firstly, reports indicate that India has been a ground for deploying Pegasus spyware by NSO Group, an Israeli firm. In October 2019, state attackers targeted activists, and in July 2021 they extended their reach to public officials and journalists. The Union Government has not clearly denied these activities in the Supreme Court of India. Moreover, investigations by Amnesty, Citizen Lab, and notifications from WhatsApp corroborate its use, suggesting a pattern in India and a matching victim profile. Secondly, Access Now and Citizen Lab last month have confirmed the validity of Apple’s threat notifications sent to Russian journalists, including Meduza’s publisher. These confirmations lend high credibility to such notifications. Thirdly, the Financial Times disclosed in March that India is seeking new spyware contracts starting at approximately $16 million and potentially escalating to $120 million in the next few years. These contracts involve companies like the Intellexa Alliance, recently featured in a report called ‘The Predator Files’,” he said.

IT minister and BJP leader Ashwini Vaishnaw claimed that Apple’s notifications were “vague and non-specific”, and questioned whether Apple devices are really secure.

“The Government of Bharat takes its role of protecting the privacy and security of all citizens very seriously and will investigate to get to the bottom of these notifications,” Vaishnaw said. “In light of such information and widespread speculation, we have also asked Apple to join the investigation with real, accurate information on the alleged state-sponsored attacks.”

Varadarajan is among half a dozen journalists in India, including The Wire‘s founding editor M.K. Venu, on whose phones Amnesty International’s Tech Lab found traces of Pegasus.

The Wire has written to Apple for comments on any further information it can share and this story will be updated when it does.

In 2021, the Pegasus Project had confirmed that more than a dozen phones in India – of politicians, journalists, human rights defenders and others – had been infected with the Israeli spyware which hundreds more had likely been targeted, including phones connected with the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi, lawyers, a sitting judge, an election commissioner, the ousted CBI director and family members of such persons also, just before and after the previous general elections in 2019.

The final report of a Supreme Court committee set up to investigate cases of the use of the military-grade spyware is yet to be made public. While the Modi government stonewalled demands from the court on whether it had used Pegasus, it has never denied buying and deploying the spyware. The Wire partnered with several global news outlets to unveil the cyber attacks by state-sponsored entities, as the spyware company NSO Group has always maintained it only sold Pegasus to governments. You can read about Project Pegasus here.

The Financial Times ran a report in March this year on alternatives to Pegasus being mulled over for purchase. The Indian government is scouring the globe for spyware it could use which has a “lower profile” than Pegasus.

FT wrote that the Modi government is willing to spend anywhere up to $120 million to obtain the spyware, citing people familiar with the matter. India’s defence ministry declined to comment on the report, the newspaper said.

In one significant case – the Elgar Parishad case in which 16 rights activists, lawyers and academics were arrested – independent cybersecurity companies have found that the activists’ devices were compromised with spyware and this technology was used to plant incriminating ‘evidence’ on the devices.

Saving the Qatar 8: Did Hubris Hurt India’s Diplomacy?,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/qatar-8-navy-veterans-hubris-india-diplomacy,"Nov 02, 2023  |  Rohit Khanna","The month of Ramadan in 2024 starts on March 10 and ends on April 9. The dates are ideal for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to score a major diplomatic coup, right in the middle of the 2024 Lok Sabha election campaign.

The anticipated headlines may say:

‘PM Intervenes to Save The Lives of 8 Indian Ex-Naval Personnel’,

‘Modi Hai to Mumkin Hai: Qatar Emir Pardons 8 Ex-Indian Navy Personnel After PM Intervenes’

‘Death Sentence Dropped: Qatar Emir ‘Ramadan Pardon’ is All Thanks to Modi’

Primetime news channels ‘aligned’ to the government would play up yet another ‘big win’ for the PM’s diplomacy and ‘personal touch’. The families of the eight former Naval officers may finally be allowed to appear on air, after 18 months of being practically ‘blacked out’ by the media. The ‘big pardon’ would be tom-tommed in election speeches across the country, it would be all over social media. It would underscore India’s ‘Vishwaguru’ status yet again, and we would be reminded that it’s all the PM’s doing.

It’s a high-risk, high-reward game. But is it worth it?

Is it worth the lives of eight former Indian Navy officers currently on death row in a prison in Qatar? Is it worth all the months that their families have spent in the dark, with little clue about the fate of these sailors, with almost no real information about what’s being done, if anything, about saving their lives and securing their freedom?

Taking the game ‘deep’, a big mistake

In cricket terms, it’s the risky approach of taking the game ‘deep’ during a tough run-chase. Instead of pushing for the occasional boundary in the middle overs, the batters go into a defensive, ‘doing-very-little’ mode, hoping to catch up in the death overs. Except by then, the required run rate gets too high, and the game is lost.

Did India hold off pushing hard, and at the required top-most level, for the freedom of the ‘Qatar 8’? And has that now made an already tough task, exponentially harder?

There are three questions to answer:

First, did India underestimate Qatar?

Second, how does the ‘death sentence’ impact India’s position?

Third, does the Gaza conflict further complicate this matter?

Qatar raised the stakes in 2022 itself, which India missed

Let’s also understand that the exact nature of the charges against the Qatar 8 has now receded in relevance. People in India may have pointed out months ago that none of these men had dealt with submarines in their naval careers, and yet were reportedly charged with ‘spying on behalf of Israel’ for information about ‘stealth technology’ in Italian midget submarines. We may have also asked why Israel would need details of Italian submarine tech, when it has unfettered access to all this, and more, from the US. But the time for raising such questions has passed.

More worryingly, it seems the Indian government may not have realised how high Qatar had raised the stakes in this case, at the very outset. Considering that the eight men were picked up in the dead of night, with their own families not being given any details for weeks, with India’s embassy in Qatar having no initial idea about their whereabouts, let alone getting consular and legal access – it should have been clear back then that the charges, whatever they may be, were being taken very seriously by Qatar. And that Qatar itself, needed to be taken more seriously.

Underestimating Doha

Qatar has grown in stature as a pivotal state in West Asia. It hosted the crucial US-Taliban talks – that alone underlines how smartly it has positioned itself, acceptable to polar opposites as a ‘neutral’ venue for talks. Even as Qatar plays host to a crucial US air base, it also permits Hamas to run a full-fledged office on its soil. Doha is also the headquarters of the Al Jazeera media network, which presents a powerful counter-narrative to events in the region in contrast to most Western media reportage.

In bilateral terms too, Doha has been on the ascendant, subtly demanding more respect from India. On the economic front, Qatar supplies India with 40% of its liquified natural gas (LNG) fuel. Qatar’s exports to India are worth almost $17 billion, way more than India’s exports to Qatar (less than $2 billion). Also, around 7 lakh Indians make a living in Qatar, remitting crores of rupees back home and into India’s economy.

Paying the price of ‘hate’ at home

But beyond the economy, Qatar, more than most other Arab nations in recent times, has been vocal about the steep rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric and violence in India. When BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma made derogatory remarks about Prophet Mohammed, Qatar led the chorus of Arab condemnation. Sharma’s token apology and equally token suspension from the BJP is not likely to have impressed Qatar, as the radical Hindutva violence and hate have only gathered more momentum in India. Most recently, all was forgiven in the case of serial hate offender, Telangana MLA Raja Singh, as his suspension from the BJP was revoked ahead of the state assembly elections.

The BJP may have calculated that Modi’s ‘personalised’ reach-outs to the leaders of the Arab nations in recent years may get them to look away from the constantly rising anti-Muslim tide in India. But has that happened? Unfortunately not. No amount of back-channel diplomacy has been able to soften Qatar’s attitude towards the eight former sailors. Also, why should India’s diplomacy in West Asia be constantly undermined and come undone by the BJP’s domestic majoritarian politics? And why should these eight Indian citizens, with death sentences hanging over them, pay the price?

Calling up the Emir: Is it way too late?

The key question is: When was the most opportune time for India’s prime minister to pick up the phone and ask the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Al Thani, to be magnanimous and pardon our men? Almost anyone not looking at this through the lens of the 2024 election, would say that moment was long ago. The almost complete denial of access to the eight sailors, the gravity of the charges, and the intransigence of the Qatar government should have underlined the urgent need for intervention at the very top – before the array of formal charges, before a formal legal process commenced, and certainly long before the death sentences were passed.

Now, instead of asking merely for them to be set free, the starting point of any new round of diplomacy or phone calls will be about cancelling the death sentences. After a pardon, it would then be another arduous push for shorter prison sentences. And if that were achieved, it would be another long haul to request Qatar to allow the men to serve their terms in Indian prisons. And after that, it would be an almost impossible task, for India to get all charges to be dropped, and for the men to walk free.

Gaza conflict hurts chances of a ‘pardon’

But that’s not all. Let’s now add to this list of challenges the fact that we are in the middle of a full-blown, bloody conflict in Gaza. Qatar is an extremely vocal critic of Israel, even relative to other Arab nations. In such a situation – when a court in Doha has pronounced the ‘Qatar 8’ guilty of espionage on behalf of Israel, and issued the most serious punishment possible – what space, if any, is left for our diplomats to manoeuvre? Did our diplomats and the prime minister not foresee this?

As the casualties mount in Gaza, including thousands of civilians, with every news story coming through of hospitals, refugee camps and homes being targeted, with every visual of Israel employing its full military might to flatten Gaza, starve and choke its population – it becomes almost hard to imagine how someone found guilty of spying for Israel in Qatar, may be pardoned.

So now, what consolation can we genuinely offer to the eight families? Can we confidently say to them, wait for a Ramadan ‘miracle’ in 2024?

India's Need for a National Security Strategy Cannot Be Ignored,https://m.thewire.in/article/security/indias-need-for-a-national-security-strategy-cannot-be-ignored,"Nov 01, 2023  |  Shivshankar Menon","The following is a section of the keynote speech delivered by the author on October 25, 2023, at the launch of India’s National Security Challenges, a volume edited by N.N. Vohra, at the India International Centre in New Delhi.

There have been at least three attempts so far that I know of to produce a national security strategy for India. In each case the hesitation came not from the professionals, in or out of uniform, but from the political levels.

I sense, but cannot prove, that they do not wish their hands to be tied, since strategy is essentially an ends and means problem and a NSS would need to be resourced. The major advantage, to my mind, of an NSS/NSP [national security policy] would be the accountability that it would introduce into the management of defence.

CDS and higher defence management

There is a fundamental issue revealed in the book on the conception of the Chief of Defence Staff’s role and the degree to which it is operational or advisory. Both points of view are represented here, and it is for the reader to make up his mind. The record of other countries at very different levels of development and in very different situations can not be compared with India, and this book avoids falling into that trap. But we still need to find our own way on the issue. Today the CDS’ charter includes what the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff does in the US, (as the principal military advisor to the President, the Secretary Defence and the NSC), and is also the Secretary in charge of the Department of Military Affairs, a secretarial function, and is supposed to drive our military reform. His operational role is still unclear.

There is also a larger issue of the role of the multiple institutions that we have created to deal with national defence. What of the National Security Council, its secretariat and the NSA, and their relationship to the new CDS, Department of Military Affairs

and existing institutions like the Chiefs of Staff Committee? We have now had two and a half decades experience of the first NSC in a parliamentary democracy. It is time for us to clarify the the precise operational and advisory roles that the mix of institutions now play, and how they relate to each other. I say this because a clear chain of command is essential if we are to respond to the security situation facing us. Besides, uncertainty in this respect affects deterrence of our adversaries.

While a full-fledged NSP may be difficult, it is time for a white paper from the government, setting out its thinking on these issues and the path forward.

Jointness

Not surprisingly, this was a subject that was universally supported, but each one seems to have a different idea of what it should mean. Some use it as only meaning integration of the uniformed services, others also include jointness between civilians and uniformed personnel. Both are essential, and lacking in our present arrangements. Mr Vohra makes the very valid point that there has to be a national defence doctrine which enables the services to undertake joint planning and fully integrated 5-10 year defence plans. Without these, gaps in preparedness will only grow.

The first CDS was very committed to introducing jointness in the working of the services and in the creation of integrated theatre commands. We hear less about this today.

Theaterisation

This was probably the most contentious of the topics discussed. It is also something that is essential if we are to prevail over adversaries with better inner lines of communication and/or technological and logistical advantages over us. There is a fascinating discussion in the record of the discussions among panelists on higher defence management reforms (page 75) which makes clear the different points of view between the services.

In no country that I am aware of has jointness and theaterisation come about by consensus among all the stakeholders, particularly among those in uniform. Whether it was the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act in the US, or reform in the UK military, or the 2015 PLA reforms which drew on US models, reform was widely recognised as needed but its shape was finally decided on and enforced by a decisive political leadership. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 was a response to the US experience of the Vietnam War and changed the way US services interact. The services themselves “organise, train and equip” forces for use by combatant commanders (CCDRs), and the service chiefs no longer exercise any operational control over their forces. It built on the 1958 Defence Reorganisation Act which took the services out of the loop and empowered the combatant commands.

In each case there was resistance and considerable pushback, but the results in terms of effectiveness have far outweighed the unforeseen and negative consequences.

Role of civilians, reform of MOD

The book also makes clear the differences between civilian and service attitudes to the role of MOD and the new DMA, and to how to integrate the different skills that uniformed personnel and civilians bring to decision-making on defence policy. There is a common plea in this volume for accountability and professionalism in the running, manning and operation of the MOD and other national security institutions. Incidentally, Goldwater-Nichols in the US resulted in the Navy building and fortifying a “wall” between the Department of Navy’s military-run requirements process and the civilian-run acquisition process – a divide inimical to the efficient and effective support of military forces and antithetical to the spirit of the legislation. We have to ensure that we do not make the same mistake.

General Rawat in his contribution argues that in an era of total war we need the involvement of the entire society in our national defence. This is unexceptionable as a sentiment. But it does raise the larger question of whether the answer is to militarise society or civilianise (some would say civilise) the military. Europe has probably gone too far in one direction, Israel in the other. Civilianising the military opens them to politicisation and reduces their military efficacy. Militarising society produces and society on tenterhooks, prone to violence and does not necessarily produce security, as we see in the Levant. Neither is satisfactory. The quest for absolute security by one actor creates insecurity for most others. The issue is one of striking the right balance. Of respecting the laws of war while ensuring deterrence and the capability to prevail.

One thing that I would have liked more of in the book is a detailed discussion of internal security and its relation to national defence. Ajay Sahni has an excellent chapter on how internal security impacts national defence, describing the effects of growing inequality, the erosion of the integrity and autonomy of state institutions, and other recent phenomena. The spread of lawlessness and fraught centre-state relations mean that internal security increasingly impinges on our national defence.

Mr Vohra makes some pointed suggestions, based on his vast experience, for MHA to be relieved of its non-security related tasks, redesigned the Ministry of Internal Security Affairs, and manned by trained personnel deployed on long tenures. As Mr Vohra notes, there has been a progressive increase in threats to internal security (page 4), which might have merited a separate chapter in itself, for the Union government has a duty under the constitution to protect every state against internal disturbance and external aggression. But perhaps that might be a subsequent exercise to produce another such volume. To my mind the distinction between internal and external security is being blurred in cyberspace, across porous borders, and by increasing economic dependencies. It is that linkage that siloed thinking prevents us from seeing, and that creates vulnerabilities.

I cannot stress too strongly the need for us to take heed of what this book says and to act rapidly on these issues of external security management.

I say so for three reasons:

1. Though India today faces no existential threat from abroad, the external situation has worsened considerably in the last decade and a half. The task of Indian security professionals is to create an enabling environment for India’s transformation into a modern, prosperous, and secure country where every Indian has the opportunity to achieve their potential. That requires us to continue to deter our adversaries in order to avoid war as far as possible and, where that proves not possible, to increase the intervals between wars. While we have achieved that for several decades, the task of deterring our adversaries has now got harder with a slowing world economy, rising great power rivalry, and developments in technology.

Let me elaborate. Technology has changed and expanded the battlefield and nullified some of our advantages on the LAC; great power rivalry enables Pakistan to again begin charging strategic rent internationally, something she was unable to do for a few years; and, when our economy is more than ever before integrated with a slowing world economy, there will be less available for the self-strengthening, military modernisation, and defence reform that we all agree is required.

2. Secondly, deterrence has broken down along the LAC with China, our major security preoccupation. What happened in 2020 in the western sector, and subsequent developments including local disengagement in some areas, is evident to all in satellite pictures available to the public. These do not suggest that deterrence has been restored. Instead, we are in a political impasse and a military standoff, however described, with over 100,000 troops along the LAC in the western sector and infrastructure construction continuing apace. The LAC is live.

There is nothing to suggest that we are making progress towards either stabilising the border with China, or preventing China from using the threat of action on the border. The commitment of scarce resources to the standoff itself represents an opportunity cost for our national defence. It also poses serious reputational damage to us.

3. Thirdly, half-done reform creates new vulnerabilities without solving old ones. You cannot cross a chasm in two leaps. We are today in a situation where many of the reforms begun by the former CDS, General Bipin Rawat, who has a well-argued contribution in this volume, are incomplete. Operational roles need to be clear at every level, from the CDS and NSA downward. Issues that we regard as internal to us, such as the Agniveer recruitment pattern, have external ramifications in our dealings with Nepal that need to be sorted out. Other issues have been pending or hanging fire from before the CDS was appointed. The fate of the mountain strike corps, approved by the CCS in 2013, is one such example, as is the limbo in which the National Defence University awaits, and the integration of combat air in the Army. There is a long list of what needs to be done.

The common thread in all these reasons for change is the need to enhance deterrence of our potential adversaries. If their assertive behaviour is anything to go by, that deterrence has been degraded and its credibility needs to be restored. That is why reform of our defence management and armed forces so essential.

What has happened between Israel and Hamas since October 7 is an object lesson on how dangerous complacency and hubris can be and how devastating their consequences. We also see in the Levant how hard it is to restore deterrence once it is degraded, and how military options can only go so far without a clear political goal and component in the state’s response to terrorist or other attacks and threats. There are clearly lessons for us to be learnt from what is happening in the Levant.

In other words, our overall goal of transforming India remains, and will need to be defended in new ways in the years to come. This book offers us pathways forward to do so. Indeed, though I have spoken of differences of opinion expressed in the book, I was impressed by the extent to which authors from different services and varied experiences still agree on what needs to be done.

There is an apocryphal World War I story about the difference between German and Austrian attitudes to war. When the German commander reported that the situation on the eastern front was ‘serous but not hopeless’ the Austrian reported that it was ‘hopeless but not serious.’ Our situation is serious but not hopeless, despite the precarious international environment, particularly in our neighbourhood, and the pressing need for reform and modernisation of our defence. This book suggests that we can manage the situation if we reform.

Is It Time To Call India A Digital Dystopia?,https://m.thewire.in/article/uncategorised/is-it-time-to-call-india-a-digital-dystopia,"Nov 01, 2023  |  Srinivas Kodali","India is rapidly digitising. There are good things and bad, speed-bumps on the way and caveats to be mindful of. The weekly column Terminal focuses on all that is connected and is not – on digital issues, policy, ideas and themes dominating the conversation in India and the world.

Monday night’s alerts from Apple to politicians and journalists about “state-sponsored attacks” pointed to an increasing trend of using surveillance towards the suppression of the political opposition. Digital India is being hailed as the government’s flagship contribution to nation building, with technology determining our lives everyday. This utopian imagination is being hailed by many, from the World Bank to Bill Gates. But is it time for us to question whether Digital India has actually become a Digital Dystopia?

Digital India as an official Government of India programme was launched in 2014 by Narendra Modi, and digitisation has been an important agenda for this government. The BJP gave all the push necessary to build Nandan Nilekani’s imaginations of India, one where technology determines the lives of every Indian. It forced Aadhaar, UPI, GST and a host of digital technologies in a bid to formalise the economy. But this digitisation process also powered the surveillance and policing infrastructures like CCTNS, NATGRID, CMS and ICJS that were set in motion in the aftermath of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.

The surveillance infrastructures that were being developed were always directed towards the citizenry, under the garb of enumeration exercises, which was not immediately clear to the population. The Ministry of Home Affairs historically policed us through secretive systems and any push towards reforms in policing and intelligence has not been a priority. The idea of surveillance and 360-degree profiling were always part of the imaginations of the Aadhaar programme, specially with agreements between the UIDAI and MHA to share biometrics, to create tge National Population Registry and the requirement of unique IDs to link databases for creation of NATGRID.

The possibility of active surveillance of any individual through spyware was always a demand from our intelligence agencies. But this reality is far more concerning with no accountability in these agencies. Surveillance infrastructures have always been part of societies, from surveillance of telegraphs, posts to telecom networks. But unrestricted access to these systems by rogue institutions and actors has brought us here. The current reality is being cheered by the population, which has been sold this reality as a Hindutva utopia by media networks.

The techno-utopian imagination that were sold to us was that technology in the form of Aadhaar would eradicate fraud, corruption and economically make every Indian rich using their personal data. This imagination, while being utopian, could only be enforced through technology and was forced on the entire population which had no option other than fitting itself into the imaginations of a billionaire whose entire claim was that technology will fix everything.

The imagination that was sold to us was not complete and was never entirely explained to us, while rubbishing any critical questions around it. It should be clear to any individual that the early experimentation of Aadhaar on welfare schemes was just an excuse to build and test software that could be finally used for building credit profiles and a data economy. The language of fraud and duplicate Indians in welfare that was forced on us is leading us towards a witch-hunt to search for illegal citizens in the country with biometrics.

Nilekani was always silent about the surveillance aspects of his imaginations, while claiming there are no privacy issues with Aadhaar. According to Nilekani, Aadhaar linking with voter IDs will remove duplicate voters, but he won’t talk about the dangers of centralising elections and risks of online-voting which Aadhaar is expected to power. This technocracy powers the entire techno fascist machinery of the current regime. It is a symbiotic relationship for the Bangalore Ideology as Mila Samdub calls, “For the engineers of Bengaluru and their allies in neoliberal think tanks, the BJP’s Hindutva politics is the necessary condition to put their designs to work.”

This system of technology architectures that are being termed “digital public infrastructures” and are highly centralised and unaccountable are turning governance invisible. Black box governance is a feature of this imagination, where people are not told why something works or fails, with a sense of mysticism associated with technology. The Aadhaar failures and non-functional apps that are mandatory on welfare systems are being forced with an excuse of fraud prevention, while we clearly see the dismantling of social welfare infrastructure. There are claims that are associated with this setup that have started in 2008 and continue to exist.

These black boxes and techno-utopian imaginations need to be demystified for the general public. While there has been a decade of work around this, the control of reality with media narratives has been a challenge to expose the under-workings of these systems. Any language of criticism that was used by the citizenry was co-opted and was used against them to dissolve the criticism. The editorial decisions of media houses to not be critical of Aadhaar or Nilekani has already unfolded in the form of technology driven violence, that could have been prevented.

New frameworks of critical thinking and de-mystification of technology need to be evolved to make the citizenry aware of the violence being pushed with utopian claims. India is being shown as a utopian society where technology has transformed our economic lives primarily with dematerialisation of documents. But the realities of the material world are being hidden with clever marketing strategies where any discussion over fraud, corruption or poverty is replaced with UPI.

We need alternate imaginations to counter the existing narratives of techno-utopians who have sold us a dystopia while they profit from this enterprise. For a software engineer who builds these technology systems, a broken app doesn’t affect his life and he sees these technology systems as utopian solutions to a problem that doesn’t actually exist. Meanwhile this becomes a technological nightmare for the working class dependent on social welfare. Dystopias and utopias are relative in class societies and can co-exist simultaneously with different narratives among the population.

Privacy has been turned into a non-issue for people, with opposition from the economic actors who advocated against it.

India's Solidarity with Israel is an Untenable Project,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/indias-solidarity-with-israel-is-an-untenable-project,"Nov 01, 2023  |  M.K. Bhadrakumar","This article was first published on The India Cable – a premium newsletter from The Wire & Galileo Ideas – and has been republished here. To subscribe to The India Cable, click here.

India’s muscular diplomacy, an attribute of the present government, has run into heavy weather. Body blows from multiple sources – a spat with Canada, the Maldives’ triumphalism about evicting Indian servicemen, China-Bhutan normalisation, etc – testify to it. On top of it comes the latest diplomatic faux pas at the UN General Assembly over Gaza and not entirely unrelated shock and awe dealt out by Qatar last week. Doha has handed down death sentences to eight Indian ex-naval officers on charges of spying for Israel.

Whichever way one looks at the Explanation of Vote (EoV) on the UNGA resolution on Thursday on Gaza, India’s abstention was a mistake. Our diplomacy has become entrapped in our solidarity with Israel.

The topmost consideration for India at the UNGA debate should have been that the draft was tabled by the Arab and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries with whom India has fraternal ties, and, second, it called for an “immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce” in Gaza, which is an urgent necessity.

Yet, France outclassed us, exposing the need for more creative UN diplomacy on our part. France not only sought that some reference to Hamas’ raid into Israel on October 7 be made in the draft but on a recent visit to Tel Aviv, President Emmanuel Macron even proposed an alliance of like-minded countries to take on Hamas militarily.

Yet, when it came to the crunch, France ultimately voted for the Arab resolution and issued an EoV justifying it. As France saw it, the imperative need today is to stop the fighting and the compelling reality is the importance of being on the right side of history on the Middle East crisis, where it has high stakes. In the final analysis, what stands out for the record is the actual voting, not the EoV.

It was apparent that the Canadian amendment – at Israel’s behest and sponsored by Washington – was a clumsy attempt to divide the votes by calling for “unequivocally rejecting and condemning the terrorist attacks by Hamas.” In a notable speech that drew wide acclaim, Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN Munir Akram highlighted the contradiction.

If Canada was being fair in its amendment, he said, it should also agree to name Israel as well as Hamas. “We all know who started this. It is 50 years of Israeli occupation and the killing of Palestinians with impunity,” Akram argued, therefore, not naming either side was the best choice.

It appears that India was taken aback by Akram’s intervention at the UNGA during Agenda Item 70, Right to Self-Determination, where he forcefully linked the Palestine issue and the Kashmir problem. Alas, India’s abstention has only left the centre stage for Pakistan to occupy. This could be consequential. A prudent course would have been to identify with the stance of the Arab countries unequivocally, since this is a core issue for them and it is playing out in their region.

India should have factored in that feelings are running high in the West Asian region and the US-Israeli propaganda that the Arab world paid only lip service to the Palestinian cause doesn’t hold good. There is unmistakable anger and anguish among the regional states and a groundswell of opinion has appeared demanding a settlement of the Palestine issue for stability.

The tectonic plates of regional politics have shifted following the Saudi-Iranian rapprochement under China’s mediation, which in turn triggered new thinking in West Asia giving impetus to a focus on development. Equally, the regional states prefer to address their issues increasingly on their own steam, without external interference. China and Russia understand this but the US refuses to see the writing on the wall.

Therefore, it will prove to be damaging to our interests if a growing perception crystallises that Indians are carpetbaggers. Indo-Israeli fusion through the past decade hasn’t gone unnoticed in the Muslim countries. They resent it, perhaps, but it may not surge into view because Arabs are a hospitable people. That said, their resentment may surface if push comes to shove and their core interests are involved.

The US-Israeli attempt to put the lid on the region’s growing strategic autonomy is one such core issue. It is far from the case that the regional states — be it Qatar, Iran, Egypt, Syria or even Turkey — do not understand that the Biden administration’s grandiloquent idea of a India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor is in reality a wedge to disrupt nascent trends of unity among regional states, so as to insert Israel into regional processes and rekindle the flame of sectarian schism and geopolitical rifts, which the US historically exploited to impose its hegemony in West Asia.

That is why the three-way Qatar-India-Israel tangled mess of espionage, which should never have been allowed to happen, becomes a litmus test of mutual intentions in the geopolitics of the region. Lest it is forgotten, Qatar and Israel had collaborated, since the mid-Nineties, to prop up Hamas as an Islamist antidote to the secular-minded PLO under Yasser Arafat.

In a recent interview with Deutsche Welle, former Israeli PM Ehud Olmert disclosed, “We know that Hamas was financed with the assistance of Israel — for years — by hundreds of millions of dollars that came from Qatar with the assistance of the state of Israel, with the full knowledge and support of the Israeli government led by Netanyahu.”

That convergence — rather, Faustian deal — ended in 2009 following the three-week Gaza Massacre by Israel, whereupon Doha drew closer to Tehran. Nonetheless, a pragmatic relationship continued, and in 2015, the Qatari government facilitated discussions between Israel and Hamas in Doha in search of a possible five-year ceasefire between the two parties. Suffice it to say that Indian diplomacy is swimming in shark-infested waters. The news from Doha this week is a wake-up call.

Equally, our public discourse on Hamas as a terrorist organisation and our branding of that national liberation movement is surreal, to say the least. Although it may be difficult today for the government to openly deal with Hamas, it shouldn’t be that we lack a proper understanding of Islamism. If ever a Palestine settlement comes to fruition, Hamas, as the fountainhead of resistance, will have a lead role in it. India’s political elite must bear in mind this reality.

Eliminating Hamas from the political landscape is no longer possible, given the massive grassroots support it enjoys among the Palestinian people, which is of course a proven fact in the successive elections held in Gaza and the West Bank.

India's Green Hydrogen Initiatives Risk Increased Pollution Without Strict Carbon Accounting Rules,https://m.thewire.in/article/energy/indias-green-hydrogen-initiatives-risk-increased-pollution-without-strict-carbon-accounting-rules,"Nov 01, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India is investing heavily in green hydrogen initiatives. So far, the government has earmarked over Rs 19,000 crores to make India “the global hub” of green hydrogen energy production, use and export. But if strict rules are not put in place, our green hydrogen initiatives could end up adding to the country’s carbon emissions and polluting the environment, as per a report published by Bengaluru-based think-tank Climate Risk Horizons on October 26.

India’s green hydrogen push

Around 70% of India’s power needs currently are derived from coal, a polluting fossil fuel. India, like most of the world, is looking to increase its sources of renewable energy. One of them is green hydrogen.

Green hydrogen is hydrogen produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity (as opposed to grey hydrogen, which is generated using natural gas or coal or other polluting fossil fuels).

The aim of the National Green Hydrogen Mission under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is to make India “the global hub” of production, use and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives.

On October 7, the MNRE released a research and development “roadmap” for the Green Hydrogen Mission, budgeted at Rs 400 crore for 2-3 years alone. As per the MNRE, the initial outlay for the mission will be Rs 19,744 crore.

This includes an investment of Rs 17,490 crore for the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) programme which aims to incentivise green hydrogen production and electrolyser manufacturing (electrolysers are a critical part of producing hydrogen; the device helps split water into its hydrogen and oxygen components using a chemical process).

An amount of Rs 1,466 crore is earmarked for pilot projects, Rs 400 crore for research and development, and Rs 388 crore “towards other Mission components”, per the ministry’s website. The Ministry also launched a national single window system for approvals under the mission.

Word of caution

However, India’s green hydrogen push could end up increasing the country’s carbon emissions unless the right safeguards and proper carbon accounting systems are put in place, cautioned a report published by Bengaluru-based energy think-tank Climate Risk Horizons.

If electrolysers are run day and night (as there will be pressure to), they will operate even during times when no renewable energy is being generated. For instance, they will also run at night when there is no solar power generation. If this electricity comes from India’s coal-powered grid then, it will only add to the country’s carbon emissions rather than decrease them, the report said.

Green hydrogen produced this way, the report noted, would make it even more polluting than conventional grey hydrogen due to its embodied emissions (greenhouse gas emissions released during the production of a good).

This is because India is currently dependent on coal-generated power. and it is this that India and the world are trying to phase down to decrease emissions of carbon dioxide, a polluting greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming which, in turn, causes climate change.

There are also problems with MNRE’s definition of green hydrogen, per the report. The current definition “leaves a lot to interpretation”, such as raising questions whether it includes embodied emissions of the type of electricity being used to generate the green hydrogen. Per the report, the MNRE definition also includes the use of biomass, or organic matter from plants and waste, in producing green hydrogen. This, the report says, is “problematic both in terms of carbon emissions from the gasification process, and the source of the biomass itself”.

Need for a proper carbon accounting system

The MNRE is yet to finalise the accounting or certification methods for green hydrogen, per the report. Everything now rests on a proper accounting system – a poor system would subsidise the production of green hydrogen that is more carbon intensive than even conventional grey hydrogen, it said.

“Weak guidelines for green hydrogen will squander the promise and effectiveness of truly green hydrogen as a decarbonisation tool and will probably increase emissions, which is in direct conflict with the aims of the green hydrogen mission,” the report noted. “This could also jeopardise India’s clean hydrogen industry as a whole, as a polluting and contentious start to the sector would damage international credibility, reduce access to export markets and undermine public trust.”

“It’s essential that the MNRE gets this [accounting system/ methodology] right,” said Ashish Fernandes, CEO of Climate Risk Horizons, in a press release. “Green Hydrogen has massive potential to reduce carbon emissions from industrial sectors, but only if the accounting methods and safeguards are rigorous. This means it has to be powered 100% by new, additional renewable energy that is matched to consumption on an hourly basis. If the rules have loopholes, either by allowing RE [Renewable Energy] credits or matching consumption with RE generation on a monthly or annual basis, it will not deliver actual carbon reductions. This will undermine the green hydrogen market before it can even get started.”

There is also a risk that RE for green hydrogen “will crowd out needed investment in grid RE, with negative consequences in terms of meeting India’s climate commitments”, in a “constrained environment with high cost of capital”, per the report.

“India’s ambitious renewable energy target of 450 GW by 2030 already requires huge investment,” Fernandes said. “The green hydrogen mission will require an additional 125 GW of RE. The MNRE needs to guard against the risk that finance for RE projects that would otherwise decarbonise the electricity grid will instead be diverted to produce green hydrogen. This would delay India’s journey to net zero, undermine a nascent industry and deny states and electricity consumers the cost benefits that cheap renewable energy has to offer.”

Big corporations including the Adani Group, TATA, L&T, etc have unveiled plans to invest in the green hydrogen industry."
India Says It Is 'Leader' of Global South But UN's Gaza Vote Shows It Has No Followers,https://m.thewire.in/article/world/india-global-south-gaza-israel-sarang-shidore-interview,"Oct 31, 2023  |  Devirupa Mitra","New Delhi: The landslide numbers with which the UN General Assembly (UNGA) passed a resolution to call for a ‘humanitarian pause’ in the violence in West Asia has certainly been an effective demonstration of international public opinion, especially from the Global South.

On October 27, 121 nations voted in favour of the resolution sponsored by Jordan and the Arab Group, while 14 voted against it and 44 abstained from voting. Iraq changed its vote from abstention to ‘Yes’ later, citing technical difficulties. Most of the Global South voted in favour of the resolution, while the West largely voted negatively or abstained.

The vote took place around three weeks after Hamas launched a terror attack inside Israel which killed around 1,400 people. In retaliation, Israel unleashed a massive campaign of airstrikes followed by ground operations in the past few days. Over an estimated 8,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip so far.

The UNGA vote marked a notable change in comparison to the situation after February 2022, when the Global South largely aligned with West-backed resolutions criticising Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

However, the growing resentment over the rising costs of fuel and fertiliser – as a result of the Ukraine war – did lead to Western countries publicly acknowledging the price being paid by the rest of the world. India, which has abstained from all UN resolutions that criticised Russia for the Ukraine war, had also sought to take the mantle of the Global South’s leadership by highlighting the disproportionate economic hardship being borne by Asia, Africa and Latin America.

The October 27 vote has brought into focus even more forcefully the stark difference between the Global South and the Global North.

Writing in the Indian Express, Pratap Bhanu Mehta observed that despite the heightened concerns about a wider conflict, “there is not one significant world leader who is acting in a way that is not morally myopic or politically ill-judged”.

In his scathing critique of leaders ranging from the US president and European leaders to Arab regimes and China, he also highlighted how India’s self-professed leadership of the Global South has not gathered any support on such a key issue:

“As for India, one anecdote will suffice. I was at an international meeting recently, where someone, not unsympathetic to India, asked this question: ‘India claims to be the leader of the Global South. But let us ask the question, ‘who is following it?’”

To better understand this gulf between India and the rest of the Global South, The Wire spoke to Sarang Shidore, director of the Global South Program at the Washington-based Quincy Institute.

Shidore noted that there was a greater consensus among the developing world about the response to the situation in Gaza, with the notable exceptions of India and Philippines. The other anomaly was the cluster of Pacific Island states, although they tend to vote with the US on many international issues.

While the Philippines, aligned with the West, abstained because it said it recognised Israel’s “right to self-defence”, what raised eyebrows across the Global South was India’s refusal to back the UNGA call for a humanitarian pause.

India claimed that it didn’t vote in favour of the UNGA resolution because the text didn’t explicitly criticise the October 7 terror attack by Hamas. Incidentally, India has not mentioned Hamas in any of its public statements, including its Explanation of Vote. As an aside, the last time that Hamas was mentioned by India was in April 2004, when the Ministry of External Affairs said that the targeted assassination of Hamas leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi was “unjustified and unacceptable and cannot be condoned under any circumstances”. Then, as now, the party in power in India was the Bharatiya Janata Party. Rantisi was killed by the Israeli Air Force.

Last week at the UN, India was the only South Asian country to not vote in favour of the resolution. Similarly, the Philippines was the only Southeast Asian country to not vote positively, with Cambodia not recording its vote.

According to Shidore, the global south strongly wants the war to end and has been critical of Israel’s actions. He estimates that in the Global South, outside West Asia, more than 70% of countries voted in favour of Jordan’s resolution, while around 23% abstained and only around 7% voted against.

Breaking it down geographically, he noted that 30 African countries, 26 Latin American countries, nine Southeast Asian countries and five South Asian countries had voted in favour of the resolution.

The following is an edited version of the interview conducted via e-mail.

Is it correct to say, especially in the aftermath of this UNGA resolution, that there is even greater divergence from the West and a more unified consensus in the Global South in the latest eruption of the Israel-Palestine dispute compared to the Ukraine war?

Yes, especially in the Middle East (West Asia) among its citizenry. Middle Eastern governments however remain more ambivalent, but they are being forced into a more critical stance toward Israel and the US due to public pressure.

What is your analysis of the voting record of the Global South to the October 27 UNGA resolution?

The analysis is in my Twitter thread. The noteworthy additional element is that several Global South states – largely in Latin America, though also key African ones such as Kenya and Nigeria – preferred to add language proposed by the US and Canada condemning Hamas and mentioning Israeli hostages, but this preference was not a barrier in their clear support for the adopted resolution calling for a “humanitarian truce”.

What factors have driven such a robust response from Global South members? Is it rooted in a perception of Western hypocrisy, considerations of domestic public opinion, or national interests and external influences?

Public opinion is a strong factor in the Middle East. The view that the US practices double standards when it comes to conflict and human rights is by now well-known across the non-Western world and understood, but the Gaza crisis will only further entrench this perception.

Is it reasonable to anticipate that the growing prominence of the ‘Global South’ in discussions will bring about a shift in policies?

If this war lasts much longer or escalates, the Middle Eastern governments may take further steps and there could be a major realignment away from the US – but we are not there yet. In the rest of the Global South, this is one of many factors that is increasing alienation from the West, though it is still incremental. The other important point here is that not all Global South states are following this trend. India and the Philippines are two major exceptions – both have been relatively sympathetic to Israeli and US positions on the matter.

Has the current world order evolved enough to empower the Global South to play a more substantive role compared to the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War?

Middle Eastern states, if they took a much tougher stance toward the US and Israel, could have some impact on the war. The rest of the Global South will have less impact. However, these developments will not heal but only deepen the divergence between the West and most of the rest of the Global South. It is one factor of several.

Is a unified stance from the Global South a prerequisite for Western nations to take heed? Alternatively, is it more plausible that the rapid rise of specific nations within the Global South, bolstered by their economic clout, will prompt them to adapt their policies?

In my Foreign Affairs article, I noted that the biggest way that the Global South is asserting itself is through the actions of individual states. As I wrote, “These diverse and mostly uncoordinated actions, grounded strongly in the national interest of each country, are likely to have an impact greater than the sum of their parts.”

Many Global South states are wealthier and savvier than they were in the 20th century and have learned how to play off both sides to gain benefits for themselves. Compared to the Cold War period, their guiding principle is not “idealism, but realism, with an unhesitating embrace of national interests and increased recourse to power politics”."
"1984, the State, a Carnage and What the Trauma of a People Means to India Today",https://m.thewire.in/article/communalism/1984-sikh-pogrom-riot-community-division,"Oct 31, 2023  |  Aanchal Poddar","On this day, October 31, in 1984, the anti-Sikh riots began, following the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her bodyguards.

“It is one thing when communities attack each other but when the state is complicit in attacking one community and makes them into targets of violence, the wounds and alienation inflicted by that violence remain deeply entrenched in the community’s consciousness.”

For historian Uma Chakravarthi, this was “true for the Sikhs in 1984 and will be true for religious minorities in today’s political climate.”

This is the 39-year anniversary of the brutal violence to which Sikh people were subjected in the aftermath of the killing of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The horrors of that time lives with the survivors and their descendants even today.

Kishwar Desai, curator of Delhi and Amritsar Partition Museum says that memory is significant. “There are certain events like the Partition that remain etched in the memory of people, it lives with them and it seems like it has become a part of their DNA.” Similar is the consequence of what happened in 1984, feels Desai.

Puppy Kaur was 15 years old in November, 1984. Now a resident of Tilak Nagar, she remembers a different Delhi than the ones she has lived in since and before the violence.

“Delhi is a murderer,” she says. Puppy is now 55 years old. She lost 10 of her family members in the riots, she says. The chants of ‘kill the Sikhs, kill their children’ are vivid in her mind.

“We lived in Trilokpuri beyond the Yamuna River in Block 32. I saw kerosene poured on my father, my older brother and three of my uncles. Tyres were put around some of their necks. They were set alight,” Kaur says.

She says she saw Congress politicians and their influential supporters like Amitabh Bachchan in new light.

“He used to be my favourite before he said that ‘khoon ka badla khoon (blood for blood)’ line.

She shuts her eyes and continues, “We had to walk over dead bodies huddled together, with their skin melting under our feet”.

“Were we any less Indian? What was our fault?”

As is well known by now, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s assassination on this day in 1984 by two of her Sikh bodyguards, Beant Singh and Satwant Singh, led to a pogrom upon the Sikh community, especially in north India. This assassination came in the aftermath of the storming of the Harmandir Sahib better known as the Golden Temple by the Indian Army on the orders of the Indira Gandhi-led government. Armed mobs stormed neighbourhoods with combustible material, knives, iron rods and clubs. Killings and destruction followed on a significant scale.

The writer Amitav Ghosh wrote in his 1995 account, ‘The Ghosts of Mrs. Gandhi’, “Terror and fire had become the motifs of the three days”.

Rajiv Gandhi, who managed office after his mother’s demise, said on November 19,1984, “When a large tree falls, the earth will shake a little”.

The line prompted senior advocate H.S. Phoolka to write a book titled When a Tree Shook Delhi. Phoolka says, “This statement was a way the government wanted to cover up the matter. It was a sign to the law enforcement agencies, state administration and police to not act and for everyone to justify the pogrom.”

Nirpreet Kaur who witnessed her father being burnt alive, says she was 16 then.

“Indira Gandhi was represented as Mother India or Bharat Mata, but her death dispossessed mothers of their sons and her son stood there justifying it,” Nirpreet says.

“We were the first in the area to be targeted and they poured kerosene on my father twice and threw a matchstick from a distance and I saw him burning in front of my eyes,” she says.

Kaur, a witness in the case against Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, was shifted to Mohali from Delhi by the CBI and also charged with the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) in 1986. She was arrested in 1988 and was finally acquitted in 1996. Sajjan Kumar was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Delhi high court in 2018. The court said the sentencing could not have happened without the perseverance and courage of Nirpreet Kaur, among two others.

Over forty years since the carnage, various commissions and committees have been established to look into the role of the administration, rehabilitation of those affected and the cases themselves. The commissions have either been established to follow up on the progress of the previous recommendations or to take care of unfulfilled promises. Phoolka says, “There remains high inconsistency between the recommendations of the commissions, what was implemented and the trials conducted. The sole reason behind this was the unwillingness of the government to act with an intention.”

The Marwah Commission under then-additional commissioner of police Ved Prakash Marwah was appointed to investigate the role of the police in the carnage. It was in the middle of 1985 that the home ministry instructed the Commission to stop all proceedings when it was on the final leg. All their records were taken over and transferred to the Misra Commission. In an interview to The Hindu, Marwah spoke about the shameful role of the police in instrumentalising the violence. He discussed how there were instances when he saw the police officers not even visiting the spots from where the incidents were reported.

Phoolka also spoke about how multiple cases were diluted to single frivolously reported cases in which the other details of damage went unreported.

“There is no way that we as a community will ever be able to forget what was done to us in the three days of 1984. The memory will die only when we die,” says Puppy Kaur.

“What we as a nation should derive of it, is a lesson to not rule with division and violence,” she adds."

India’s Behaviour on the World Stage Is Not Helping Its Interests,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/indias-behaviour-on-the-world-stage-is-not-helping-its-interests,"Oct 31, 2023  |  Aakar Patel","The Indian government has abstained from calling for an end to the violence in the Gaza Strip in a UN General Assembly resolution in order to avoid upsetting the United States. India was told by the new Maldives leader to remove our soldiers from that country. Qatar sentenced eight Navy veterans to death. Sri Lanka allowed a Chinese spy ship to dock in Colombo despite India’s objections. Bhutan has said it was about to conclude boundary negotiations with China, including on Doklam. Nepal cannot use its new Gautam Buddha airport because India doesn’t allow overflight of large planes. Canada has said it would not be able to normalise visas for Indians till 2024. These things have happened in the space of a few days.

All South Asian nations except India voted to end the violence in Gaza, including Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, which traditionally votes with India. The 70 Indian military personnel in the Maldives who will now return maintain radar stations and surveillance aircraft, and Indian warships help patrol the Maldives’ exclusive economic zone. The reason we have been told to go is that the Maldives wants to favour China.

Whether we are running a successful foreign policy, as fans of the external affairs minister believe, or we are ruining India’s global reputation, as some of us think we are doing, is not important to debate. This is because views are set in stone since we are in the tenth year of the Narendra Modi years and there is sufficient evidence to convince someone one way or another.

What is more interesting is to examine what the Modi government’s foreign policy actually is and what it is intended to achieve. In 2014, the BJP manifesto said it would “strengthen SAARC” and that India’s states “will be encouraged to play a greater role in diplomacy”. For instance, Punjab, which overwhelmingly suffers when Canadian visas are affected, would caution New Delhi on foreign policy.

In 2019, both these references were eliminated. No fresh text replaced it but those who study foreign policy praised a new approach that they saw coming together.

This approach comes from a series of speeches made by Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on things as diverse as China’s rise to power, India’s lost decades, the Mahabharata, maritime power and the COVID-19 pandemic.

These assorted speeches were compiled into a book, called The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World. What are these strategies?

First, Jaishankar assumes that the US and Europe will continue to look inward (his book was published just before Donald Trump lost the 2020 election), while China would continue to rise. This would open the space for countries like India to be opportunistic in their engagements with the world and they did not need consistency.

What India wanted was a “multi-polar Asia” – meaning one in which India could claim parity with China. Many balls would need to be kept in the air (Jaishankar has a fondness for stock phrases) and India would handle them with dexterity. This was opportunism, but that was all right because opportunism was India’s culture. The Mahabharata’s lessons, Jaishankar says, are that deceit and immorality are merely to “not play by the rules”. Drona’s demanding of Eklavya’s thumb, Indra’s appropriation of Karna’s armour, Arjuna using Shikhandi as a human shield, these were but “practices and traditions”. Inconsistency in policy was not only fine but required because “obsessing about consistency” made little sense in changing circumstances.

But what was such a doctrine to be called?

In a speech he made where he first laid out this doctrine of opportunism and inconsistency, Jaishankar said it is hard to give it a name. He takes up and discards the phrases – “multi-alignment” (“sounds too opportunistic”) and “India first” (“sounds self-centred”). He settles at “advancing prosperity and influence”, which he says is accurate but admits is not catchy. He believes that some name will eventually come if it is pursued long enough, because part of the challenge is that we are still in the early phase of a major transition.

Perhaps that is so.

Another reason that he was unable to come up with a name for it as clean and understandable as, say, “non-alignment”, could be that this was no real foreign policy at all. The problems that have been listed at the top of this article reflect this lack of coherence and effectiveness. Buying cheap Russian oil when nobody is stopping you from doing so is not a foreign policy, but it was praised as being that. A rotating presidency of the G-20 was not an achievement, but that is how it was sold to Indians.

What interested the prime minister, and what made for pageant and ceremony, was being passed off as something meaningful. It is not easy to escape the conclusion that Jaishankar provided the sophistry to cover what was essentially random and directionless behaviour by Prime Minister Narendra Modi passing off as foreign policy strategy.

Jaishankar says that this nameless policy of his is intended to achieve four outcomes. Greater prosperity at home; peace on the borders; protection of Indians and enhanced influence abroad.

Once again, there is no point in going through what is happening on the borders or on prosperity. The issue is whether having examined what we have tried to achieve and looking at what results around us, we should reassess what India’s role in the world is and whether we are doing the right thing for ourselves."
"India’s Bowling Attack, Diverse and Deadly, Is Fuelling World Cup Run",https://m.thewire.in/article/sport/india-bowling-attack-diverse-and-deadly-cricket-world-cup,"Oct 31, 2023  |  Pradeep Magazine","‘Extra Cover’ is veteran journalist Pradeep Magazine’s column on the Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023.

This piece is as much a celebration of India’s (so far) invincible World Cup cricket team, as it is of its diversity. Never has an Indian team in my living memory or beyond that, been so representative of what India as a nation is. Unity in diversity may sound a trite cliché, especially when we are living in divisive times, but it still best sums up a country which is a melting pot of different religions and castes.

India may be screaming ‘Rohit, Rohit’ and ‘Kohli, Kohli’, but it is the team’s lethal bowling and the variety it has to offer that is leading India’s unstoppable march and makes them easily the most favoured team to win the World Cup.

The five warriors – a Ramgarhia Sikh, two Muslims, one from an OBC (Other Backward Classes) community and an upper caste person – are sending fear down the spine of the batsmen. They are, through their sheer skill and self-belief, entertaining thousands inside the stadium. The thunderous, cacophonic sounds that create a wave of support for the home team must sound like a death knell to the opposition teams.

In this united flavour of Indian national identities, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Kuldip Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja make an impregnable shield, and, probably, hold a lesson for our nation.

There is something very strange and even intriguing about our nation, where caste and religion are the two most important markers of identity – yet we are shy to acknowledge it publicly. Those who control the levers of power would like us to believe caste does not matter but are proud of their upper caste lineage. Cricket, unlike many sports in India, has for long remained a preserve of the ruling elites. Most cricketers of the past may not have come from rich backgrounds, but were mostly city-bred middle-class Brahmins. Sure, Muslims and a few Sikhs or an odd Christian did break into the Indian team, but by and large, it has always been a struggle to find lower caste representation in the team.

With the 80s’ cricketing revolution, symbolised by India winning the 1983 World Cup and the emergence of the dynamic Kapil Dev, a change started taking place. Kapil himself was from a non-cricketing centre like Chandigarh. When he lifted the World Cup in the Lord’s balcony, Kapil ignited a billion dreams. For young kids in the lanes and bylanes of cities or village maidans it was no longer a fantasy to aspire to play for India.

By the late 90s and finally in the 21st century, boys from small towns were finding a place in the team: Mahendra Singh Dhoni being its best example and his 2011 World Cup winning six, played with imperious nonchalance, remains an image no Indian can forget. This mix of big-city boys and small-town aspirants, backed by an expanding base and infrastructure for the game, has today propelled India to the number one team position in the world.

The diversity we are talking about is obviously spreading and today an Indian cricket team no longer finds itself falling short of the religious/caste social matrix.

I would not be overstating the fact that Jasprit Bumrah is a phenomenal bowler, whose unusual skills and intuitive understanding of his craft make him almost unplayable at times.

Then there is Mohammed Shami, who follows the more conventional path. With the swerving ball, released after great dexterity from his cocked wrists, he creates magic to rattle the stumps.

Mohammad Siraj, the least experienced of the trio but never short of effort and enthusiasm, keeps surprising the batsmen with his pace and movement.

And if these three were not a handful, the batsmen now have to deal with a different challenge.

The foxy, wily, Kuldeep Yadav, aided by steely wrists, spins the ball both ways. His control of the pace, impeccable line and length leave the batsmen bewildered. Should he go forward or back? Will the ball turn away, come in or straighten? He is doomed in this web of confusion and uncertainty.

Ravindra Jadeja is exceptional. He is like a locomotive machine, which requires no greasing and can deliver ball after ball with variations, just minimum enough to fox the batsman. His control over his length, his athleticism and calm in nerve-wracking situations make him simply an indispensable member of the team.

A vital cog in India’s diversity is missing from the team: a Dalit. What does it speak of a nation when a community that constitutes about a fifth of the population has no representation in its most popular sport? If even today, we have to go decades back and cite Palwankar Baloo as an example of a Dalit having played for India, it goes to show that we have failed the community. There is not enough space, access and encouragement to break through a systemic malaise.

Let us for now celebrate the progress that has been made and hope that there is more in the future. As India inches closer towards its goal of winning the World Cup, it is for the Indian fans and the teeming crowds to realise diversity is a strength. It is to be celebrated and not drowned out by divisive slogans.

"Ahead of FATF Meeting, Report Says India Weaponising Terror Financing, Money Laundering Laws Against NGOs",https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/ahead-of-fatf-meeting-report-says-india-weaponising-terror-financing-money-laundering-laws-against-ngos,"Oct 31, 2023  |  Sukanya Shantha","Mumbai: Ahead of the Mutual Evaluation Review (MER) scheduled on November 3 to evaluate the anti-money laundering laws and financing of terrorism in India, a shadow report compiled by anonymous civil society actors and forwarded to the FATF by the Global NPO Coalition on FATF shows that India has weaponised its laws to target and stifle non-profit organisations (NPOs) in the country. The MER is an assessment of a country’s measures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The MER would be followed by a plenary discussion in June 2024.

The shadow report, based on interviewing representatives of over 700 NGOs and field experts, finds that the Indian government – without involving or informing the NGOs about the ways of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – has been indiscriminately targeting them on “unproven” and “frivolous claims”. The FATF, an intergovernmental organisation established in 1989 by the Group of Seven (G-7) countries, leads a global action to tackle money laundering, terrorist and proliferation financing.

The 46-page shadow report identifies multiple counts on which India is non-compliant with FATF standards and has failed to act upon the recommendations made by the intergovernmental organisation in the 2010 MER of India. In 2010, the MER specifically noted that India had no comprehensive assessment of its financial institutions. In addition, the MER had also recommended India undertake a detailed risk assessment of the NPO sector for terrorist financing. Even 13 years after the recommendation, according to the study, India has not made public whether or not it has carried out any work to identify such risks in the NPO sector. Instead, the report says: “It follows a one-size-fits-all approach that targets the entire NPO sector based on unproven or frivolous claims.”

India, in the MER 2010, by its own admission, had said that the risk of terrorist financing among NPOs in India is small. However, in the past decade, more specifically after the Narendra Modi-led BJP government came to power, the number of refused licenses to the NGOs has rocketed from 41 in 2010 to 20,693 NGOs in 2023. This represents an increase of refusals by 50,000%. The refusal of licenses became possible after the scope (to control and prosecute) of The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 expanded exponentially.

Although set up in 1989, the FATF went through a significant change post-September 11, 2001 twin blast in the US. The FATF revised its recommendations, and nine special recommendations were added to the initial 40. One of them specifically dealt with the NPOs that were “particularly vulnerable to terrorist financing abuse”. In 2008, FATF published a typology report focusing on the funding pattern of terrorist organisations and noted that “charities are attractive to terrorist networks as a means to move funds”. This very generic observation attracted flak from all quarters and it was noted that this specific recommendation without a clear rationale was “a danger to civil society organisations because it enabled governments to bring in repressive laws under the garb of regulating NPOs”. And the fear came true in India.

The primary legislation regulating cross-border funding for NPOs in India is the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010. When it was passed, the primary concern highlighted that over half of the NPOs did not declare their foreign contributions. When the FCRA law was first enacted in 1967, the main focus of the Act remained on the prohibition of foreign funds in domestic elections. But ironically, in 2018, political parties were made explicitly exempt from scrutiny of funds they received from abroad through the passage of the Finance Bill 2018, which was passed without debate. This shift, the shadow report says, denotes how the Indian government perceives NPOs. While former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh accused NPOs of blocking the building of a nuclear power plant in India, Modi has gone several steps ahead and accused NPOs of conspiring to remove him from office.

In 2020, the FCRA law was made more stringent by prohibiting organisations from sub-granting to other organisations, and this amendment came into force amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, in which over 5.32 lakh deaths were reported in the country. The researchers of the shadow report, through conversations with a range of international funders, as well as organisations working on the ground in India to address the COVID-19 crisis, have established a consistent pattern of misuse of FATF-inspired laws in the regulation of nonprofits leading to critical supplies being denied to NPOs at a time when human lives were at stake.

One of the officials from an international donor organisation states: “Despite timely intervention by international donor agencies to provide resources, India represented unique challenges when it came to receiving funds. Unfortunately, the challenges were artificially created by the government despite a severe need for relief work.” Contrary to the logistical challenges faced in other countries, in India, the primary hurdle for getting funds to those in need was the Indian government’s misuse of banking institutions. “India’s banking institutions did not release the money to the beneficiary organisations citing security concerns flagged by the government,” the report identifies. These hurdles were faced by many domestic NGOs in spite of recipients having full regulatory clearance, including FCRA certification.

The report, basing its findings on news articles and individual interviews, points out that central agencies like the Enforcement Directorate, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the National Investigating Agency have become “a political tool and is being misused to target opposition leaders and civil society in India”. Among the alarming statistics is the number of cases registered by these agencies and the eventual success (or lack of) in proceeding with them in the courts. For instance, of the over 6,000 cases registered with the ED, only 25 have gone to trial. The number of cases handled by the ED has dramatically increased after the 2010 MER, as India tripled its resources to empower the central agency.

The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, under which the ED registers and investigates cases, underwent an amendment in 2012. Following this amendment, the ED could make use of a specific section 3 of the Act, which covers “all activities relating to concealment, possession, acquisition, or use of the proceeds of crime and projecting or claiming it as untainted property, within the offense of money laundering.”

The report says: “A perfect example of the “unintended consequences of FATF recommendations” is the weaponisation of the ED in India, which is being used as a political tool by the government to target opposition leaders and NPOs who are critical of the government.”

While the ED has actively gone after prominent international NPOs like Amnesty International, religious institutions and churches, and prominent human rights defenders, the report states that it has avoided investigating corporate fraud and serious allegations of stock price manipulation by corporations close to the ruling party such as the Adani Group.

Similar to the FCRA and PMLA laws, the government also brought significant changes to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in 2012. This too was done following the 2010 MER.

Like the NGOs working on the ground during the COVID-19 pandemic, several child rights, human rights and environmental organisations also faced severe pushback from the government. Many of them, including Amnesty International, were driven out of India in the past years after cases were registered against them and their bank accounts were frozen.

In interviews with 11 sectoral experts, including the leadership and management of leading child rights organisations across multiple states, funders and serving and former bureaucrats involved in the regulation of this sector, the report found that most of them “expressed significant fears of reprisal and therefore demanded anonymity as a condition for participating in this study”.

Starting with NGOs involved in organising protests against the then-proposed Koodankulam nuclear plant as early as 2011 to Greenpeace in recent years, many NGOs have been forced to shut operations in the country under the accusation that “foreign hands” were involved in funding environmental protests in the country.

As their collective demand before the FATF, the shadow report calls upon India to “stop misusing FATF standards to target legitimate NPOs”. The report has also recommended that India be directed to revise restrictive provisions of the FCRA, PMLA and UAPA that violate the mandate of recommendations.

The Global NPO Coalition and Amnesty International have also raised their concerns in a letter sent to FATF president T. Raja Kumar. They have asked the FATF to “Include at least one independent and impartial civil society expert either directly in the team of evaluators or involve them otherwise in the MER process. Such a person will be able to advise the team on the nature of civil society concerns without prejudice and warn evaluators of attempts to obfuscate the situation on the ground.”

“We believe that the upcoming evaluation presents an opportunity for the FATF to denounce any disproportionate, arbitrary, and unnecessary restrictions on India’s NPO sector. The FATF must call on India to respect human rights and their international obligations. By including an independent NPO expert in the evaluation team and ensuring evaluators meet the impacted NPOs, the FATF can ensure its recommendations are being complied with by the Indian government both in letter and in spirit,” the letter states.

The Global NPO Coalition on FATF calls itself a “loose network of diverse nonprofit organisations”. “The Coalition advocates for improvement in the quality and effectiveness of FATF Mutual Evaluations with sustained outreach to the NPO sector… The aim is to mitigate the unintended consequences of countering the financing of terrorism policies on civil society in order that legitimate charitable activity is not disrupted,” the coalition says on its website."
Many Instances of Academic Un-Freedom in India Stem From Rising Hindu Nationalism: Report,https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/many-instances-of-academic-un-freedom-in-india-stem-from-rising-hindu-nationalism-report,"Oct 31, 2023  |  Anirudh S. K.","New Delhi: Violence and academic penalties against student expression are prevalent in India and many such incidents seemingly stemmed from an authoritarian environment related to Hindu nationalism, a report released today by the Scholars at Risk (SAR) network found.

SAR is an international organisation that works to protect scholars and promote academic freedom.

Every year since 2015, it has published reports on trends in attacks on academic freedom around the world titled ‘Free to Think’.

Its 2023 edition of ‘Free to Think’ – which analysed 409 attacks on higher education in 66 countries and territories between July 2022 and June 2023 – found that such attacks are a global problem and occur in diverse ways.

India is a group of 16 countries from which SAR profiled concerning cases in more detail.

Among the “most notable violations of student expression” SAR noted in India during the reporting period was the action taken against students who tried to watch the BBC’s documentary India: The Modi Question.

The documentary is critical of Narendra Modi’s role in the 2002 Gujarat riots as chief minister of that state.

The Indian government called the documentary “hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage” and directed YouTube and Twitter to take down links leading to it.

SAR noted that the police detained Delhi University (DU) and Jamia Millia Islamia students in January for trying to publicly screen the documentary.

It also noted that students from DU as well as other universities were punished or threatened for planning or trying to watch the -documentary – in one case, DU students were detained by police for protesting the suspension of a fellow student.

Another incident from DU’s track record that made it to SAR’s report was when police detained students protesting against the alleged harassment of their classmates at the Indraprastha College for Women during their annual fest.

The report also tracked an instance of action against university teachers – when the South Asian University suspended four of its faculty members for supporting students who had protested against reduced stipends and lack of adequate representation.

“Expulsions, dismissals, suspensions, and other forms of professional retaliation or silencing can have a corrosive effect on institutional autonomy,” SAR said in the report.

It continued to warn that they can “even contribute to brain drain, as scholars and students seek fairer and more transparent environments in which to conduct their research, teaching, and studying.”

‘Education as a space to promote dominant ideologies’

SAR went on to identify instances across the world where authoritarian governments were encroaching on academic spaces to fulfil their agendas.

“Rising global illiberalism and democratic backsliding means that governments are increasingly using their regulatory powers to encroach on academic space,” the report said.

“In some of the most closed and authoritarian contexts, higher education is being used as a space to promote specific dominant ideologies.”

An instance it found in India was the University Grants Commission’s introduction of a reportedly mandatory course on Indian knowledge systems that critics said was an attempt to colour the syllabus with the ruling party’s ideology.

Similar incidents involving the revision of syllabi perceived to be favourable to the ruling government have taken place in the recent past.

“University complicity with the government was also a concern,” SAR continued to say, noting that DU and Gujarat University have stymied attempts to inspect Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s degrees.

Speaking of Modi, the report also acknowledges that two DU students were effectively confined to their home ahead of a university event featuring Modi as chief guest.

Local police allegedly told the students that they were being detained “for the safety of the prime minister” as they “might create [a] ruckus at the DU event”.

DU went out of its way to ensure student compliance during the ceremony, with some of its colleges mandating attendance at screenings of the event and barring students from wearing black-coloured clothing, a common symbol of dissent.

G.N. Saibaba

SAR dedicated a section of its report to scholars in prison to whom it said it provided public support over the past year.

“Collectively, these individuals, imprisoned for their peaceful academic and expressive activities and associations, are subjected to judicial harassment; unfair or inadequate legal proceedings; lengthy pre-trial detention and/or sentences; abuse and torture in custody; denial of access to legal counsel, appropriate medical care, or family; and other forms of mistreatment,” it said in the report.

It added that these actions also affect the wider academic community by sending a message that “expressing ideas or raising questions can have dire consequences”.

One of these scholars is G.N. Saibaba. SAR presents the details of his case.

Its report quotes UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders as saying earlier this year that “[Saibaba’s] continued detention is shameful. It bears all the hallmarks of a State seeking to silence a critical voice.”

Saibaba is a former Delhi University English professor who had travelled to tribal areas and engaged in activism on their behalf.

He was arrested in 2014 and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2017 for having links to Maoist rebels.

Although he was discharged from prison by the Bombay high court, the Supreme Court set aside the discharge order in April.

He is wheelchair-bound with over 90% physical disability and has alleged medical negligence several times during his incarceration.

One of his co-accused, Pandu Pora Narote, died in August last year after contracting swine flu in jail.

SAR is not the only one to have noticed the decline of academic freedom in India.

In an update to its ‘Academic Freedom Index,’ the V-Dem Institute noted earlier this year that India is among 22 countries and territories out of 179 in the world where institutions and scholars enjoy ‘significantly less freedom today than 10 years ago.’"
"Two Cheers for the Election Commission of India, It's Time They Earned a Third",https://m.thewire.in/article/government/two-cheers-for-the-election-commission-of-india-its-time-they-earned-a-third,"Oct 31, 2023  |  Badri Raina","Two cheers for the Election Commission (EC) of India for gathering the courage to disallow the ruling party from taking out ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ in five poll-bound states and one constituency in Nagaland.

The EC also deserves an applause for proscribing the use of the loaded term “rath prabharis” as the nomenclature of in-service government employees sought to be dubiously drafted for the “showcasing and celebration” of the assumed success of government policies.

But here is the point: Do Union government service conduct rules, that lay down what employees of the executive may or may not say or do while in service, permit their politicisation on behalf of the powers-that-be?

Think back to how an earlier chief executive of the nation, as puissant as the current one, was disqualified from the right to contest an election for six years for the smallest of transgressions: a government official who, despite having resigned from his post, helped fix a microphone at one of her public rallies.

Peanuts, wouldn’t you say, next to what the present dispensation calls upon in-service officers to do without the least qualm.

To reiterate: these officers are not being asked simply to survey the good or bad implementation of government policies; they are tasked to “showcase” and “celebrate” the same – a political job that rightfully belongs to party satraps in charge of propagation.

The enormity of the systemic transgression of what the government intends with respect to in-service officers thus is the root offence, and one that must draw the EC’s ire much more than just the taking out of the yatra or using a particular nomenclature for the official propagandists-to-be, bad as those offences are.

Using Ram in Electioneering

And, then, there is another even more deeply worrying and questionable breach of maryada (rules of conduct) that the honourable EC needs to call out without hesitation.

This pertains to the brazen use of posters and hoardings in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan depicting the new Ram temple building in Ayodhya next to the ubiquitous picture of who else but the prime minister.

The breach does not comprise merely the blatant misuse of religion for political purposes but also the breach of what we are told Ram stood for – namely his commitment to maryada and placing personal ethics above state power.

The constitutional rules of the political life of our democracy do not permit the use of religion in pursuing political goals.

Those who still draw their breath as citizens from the constitutional regime must emphasise that foundational tenet the more it is sought to be subverted by an autocratic order.

And, in the case of Ram, Bharat proudly showcases a deity who put aside his right to state power in order to follow maryada by deferring to the self-regarding wishes of a step-mother to install her own son as king.

Also read: ‘Rath Prabhari’ Move Illegal As It Is Wholesale Politicisation of Civil Services: EAS Sarma

What an apostasy, therefore, to use Ram – who gave up state power for a higher, selfless ideal – for exactly the contrary purpose of acquiring state power by any means whatsoever.

Clearly, the EC must feel the canny abuse of this breach of the rules of the game, both in the prohibited misuse of religion and in rubbishing what Ram actually exemplified – the abjuration of political power in favour of an ethical principle.

And how, one may ask, can the BJP appropriate Ram to its own lowly objectives when it also claims that everyone in Bharat venerates Ram not for assuming state power but giving it up?

It is time, therefore, for the EC to work towards earning a third cheer by prohibiting both the misuse of government servants for “showcasing and celebrating” the success (sic) of government schemes, as well as prohibiting the irreligious deployment of Ram.

Should the EC rise to the occasion, a truly game-changing blow would be struck to bolster a democracy which everyday totters and unravels at key constitutional injunctions.

So let the EC remember that doyen of Election Commissioners, the late T.N.Seshan, and do the right and proper.

In doing so, they will not but earn a place next to that legendary defender of the constitutional order – a maryada which alone legitimates the republic."
"India’s Abstention in UN Gaza Truce Vote Reflects Amoral, Apathetic Exceptionalism",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/indias-abstention-in-un-gaza-truce-vote-reflects-amoral-apathetic-exceptionalism,"Oct 31, 2023  |  Deepanshu Mohan","This piece was first published on The India Cable – a premium newsletter from The Wire & Galileo Ideas – and has been republished here. To subscribe to The India Cable, click here.

India abstained in the UN General Assembly vote on a Jordanian-led resolution that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict. More recently, the UN Security Council (UNSC) too failed to adopt a Brazil-led draft resolution that would have called for humanitarian pauses in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict to allow full access for aid to the Gaza strip after the US vetoed the text.

The US had then said it was disappointed that the Brazil-led UN resolution had made no mention of Israel’s right to self-defence. The Indian government defended its decision to abstain in a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for a humanitarian truce and ceasefire in Gaza, saying it did not include “explicit condemnation” of the October 7 terror attacks in Israel.

Amoral exceptionalism

In a recent article, this author explained the normative-existential issues concerning both the limitations of international law, its applications, and the circumscribed (often selective application of) the international justice architecture to deal with concerns tied to an applied understanding of ‘justice’ and ‘sovereignty’.

The US’s own outlook to foreign policy and its pre-defined paradoxical outlook has often been studied under the broader ambit of applied American exceptionalism, which suggest a number of confrontational features in America’s foreign policy outlook.

While discretionary use of American exceptionalism is not to be understood as a “unified body of thought,” it is described along the lines of “an unwavering belief in the uniqueness of the United States and a commitment to a providential mission to transform the rest of the world in the image of the United States.”

In the Indian context, its own version of amoral exceptionalism has no rational, coherent foreign policy explanation. This is also not the first time India has taken such an indifferent stance under the Modi government.

Even during the Russia-Ukraine war, India consistently continued to provide indirect economic support to the Russian economy by buying cheaper crude oil while justifying its economic choices under a strategic non-alignment foreign policy outlook. India’s abstention and silence too came at the expense of taking a ‘moral’ position which would have voiced support for the Ukrainian situation-or helped in restoring peace.

If A’s friend commits murder and A maintains a position of ‘silence’ or gives the friend a free pass, what does it say about A and her/his moral character?

I raised this question then, and we can ask the same now.

If India’s position was to really non-align, a projected ‘Vishwaguru’ that spent crores of PR money during the G20 summit in hailing India as a ‘mother of democracy’ and a ‘voice of peace’ could have utilised each of these situations to play peacemaker and work closely with both countries towards peace. We see no such effort or intent on part of the Modi government. Tokenistic statements or symbolic gestures have little meaning when the state of conflict continues to expand with not only regional but also global ramifications.

Criteria of an exceptionalist foreign policy

The scholars Nicola Nymalm and Johannes Plagemann argue, “An exceptionalist foreign policy (may) consist of five criteria: a mission to “liberate” others in the pursuit of a universal “common good,” a sense of being free from external constraints, the need to have an external enemy in a hostile world of “universal threats,” and perceiving oneself as an innocent victim.”

American exceptionalism has often been equated with unilateralism or even exemptionalism, namely the belief that the United States is not bound by rules and norms governing the “unexceptional rest.” Exemptionalism thus legitimises the transgression of international law, for example through interventions made by the US like the Iraq War in 2003.

Exceptionalist discourse also expresses a peculiar link between a state’s foreign policy and its self-understanding as a unique society or civilisation that is related to some form of higher order revelation or spiritual or otherworldly character.

This link, according to Nymalm and Plagemann, is peculiar because it establishes uniqueness as a foundation for, first, a conviction of moral superiority over virtually every other society, based on which the self-ascribed exceptionalist state pursues an allegedly universal common good in its foreign policy conduct.

Second, exceptionalism based on uniqueness implies the belief in an exceptional state’s disposition as impossible to be replicated by others.

The interplay between ‘uniqueness’ (or particularity) and ‘universality; is what constitutes the paradox of exceptionalism: A unique insight into supposedly universal values and their foreign policy implications is derived from a particular civilizational or spiritual heritage, political history, and/or geographical location.

In the current context, the US’s own reasons for vetoing the Brazil-led UN resolution may find its own justification rooted in voicing support for its ally, Israel, and its right to self-defence.

It speaks of American ― and now Indian ― hypocrisy and the double standards of Washington, which supports one war ― Russia-Ukraine ― and garners alliance support from allies on humanitarian grounds for the Ukrainian cause while splitting its focus wide open in another scenario. That’s the world we are living in.

In a multipolar world, one needs to take a closer look within our own actions, as nations, at the paradoxical and insidious nature of amoral, apathetic ‘exceptionalism’ evident in similar foreign policy interventions, when nations act paradoxically on meeting their own interests and strategic goals at the expense of civilian lives (often labelled as ‘collateral casualties’).

The lives and livelihoods of Palestinians, as Noam Chomsky has argued, have often been less relevant to the cause of the powerful and wealthy nations, than their land, which doesn’t promise any wealth or natural resource endowments, but only allows other nations (like Israel) to brutalise and occupy them without fear of punishment or sanction from their more powerful allies.

From the Indian perspective, this questions our own collective conscience and understanding of justice ― what it means for those who are powerless, and apathetically ignored due to the exceptionalism and presumed moral superiority of a force that builds its moral foreign policy structure around projected values (vishwaguru, mother of democracy, voice of Global South, peace, justice, democracy, and freedom) aligned to its own narrow self-interest.

The others whom The Wire can confirm have received the warning from Apple are well known people who are open critics of the Narendra Modi government.

The Wire has written to Apple for comments on any further information it can share and this story will be updated when it does.

In 2021, Project Pegasus had unveiled possible attacks on hundreds of phones of leaders of the political opposition, including several phones connected with the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi, lawyers, civil society activists, sitting and retired judges, at least one election commissioner, and family members of such persons also, just before and after the previous general elections in 2019.

A final report of the Supreme Court committee set up to investigate cases of the use of Israeli-made software, Pegasus is yet to be released. The Modi government has never denied using Pegasus. You can read about Project Pegasus here. The Wire partnered with several global news outlets to unveil the cyber attacks by state-sponsored entities, as the spyware company NSO Group has always maintained it only sold Pegasus to governments.

Financial Times ran a report in March this year on alternatives to Pegasus being mulled over for purchase, some time back. The Indian government is scouring the globe for spyware it could use which has a “lower profile” than Pegasus, the advanced Israeli surveillance software.

FT wrote that the government is willing to spend anywhere up to $120 million to obtain the software, according to the newspaper which said it had spoken to people familiar with the matter. India’s defence ministry declined to comment on the report, the newspaper said.

In one significant case – the Elgar Parishad case in which 16 rights activists, lawyers and academics were arrested – independent cybersecurity companies have found that the activists’ devices were compromised with spyware and this technology was used to plant incriminating ‘evidence’ on the devices.

Qatar Death Row Case Must Alert India to Likely Scenarios Discharged Agniveers Could End Up in,https://m.thewire.in/article/security/qatar-death-row-case-must-alert-india-to-likely-scenarios-discharged-agniveers-could-end-up-in,"Oct 31, 2023  |  Rahul Bedi","New Delhi: India’s predicament over saving the eight retired Indian Navy personnel sentenced recently to death in Qatar – allegedly on espionage charges – remains an issue shrouded in mystery, as neither side has, so far, publicly disclosed any details regarding the case.

But it is also a grave dilemma, with potential future ramifications for possible situations involving ‘Agniveers’ who could, after their inevitable (and involuntary) exit, opt for gainful employment with overseas mercenary groups and private military contractors (PMCs), and in some instances, eventually end up in sticky situations in foreign countries, much like the naval retirees on death row in Qatar.

Of course, the eight former Indian Navy personnel in Qatar were not mercenaries as they had not been recruited by the Gulf sheikhdom to participate in a conflict or acts of violence aimed at either overthrowing the government or undermining the state which employed them. But it was evidently their military skill which their employer found attractive. And which has put them in harm’s way, creating a challenge for Indian diplomacy.

All eight – seven officers and one sailor – had been recruited by Dahra Global Technologies owned by Khamis Al Ajami, a retired squadron leader of the Royal Oman Air Force and Qatari national, which provided support solutions to Qatar’s aerospace, security, defence, information technology and communication sectors.

Ajami had hired these officers over several years to reportedly instruct Qatari Navy officers in operating, amongst other tasks, two classified and advanced ‘midget’ submarines under acquisition by Doha from Italy. Weighing between 70-150 tons midget submarines are lethal underwater assets, as they were virtually undetectable in their missions, which expressly involved penetrating harbours to undertake sabotage operations.

According to varied media and industry reports quoting official sources, the sentenced IN personnel were accused by Qatar State Security of spying for the Israelis – who are concerned about Qatar being the first Arab state in the Middle East to begin operating submarines. Since India has close strategic and defence ties with Israel, it is possible the Qatar authorities believe that the task of ‘snooping’ on the Qatari Emiri Naval Forces’ Italian-origin midget boats – which were in the process of being commissioned – had been outsourced to Dahra’s IN personnel by Tel Aviv. This theory was first propounded by a Qatari media platform, al Watani last October and then reported by IRNA of Iran.

The fact that India’s defence attache at the embassy in Qatar, Captain Mohan Atla, left the country some four months after the eight former IN men were arrested has fuelled speculation that his departure was linked in some way.

No official confirmation to authenticate either of these versions is forthcoming, as officials remain tight-lipped over the highly sensitive l’affaire Qatar. But security sources claimed that Qatar had handed over the court judgement to the Indian government over the weekend and senior foreign office and security officials were evaluating possible remedial options to try and mitigate the death sentence and effect the repatriation of the convicted IN personnel.

Gainful employment options with overseas mercenary groups

Meanwhile, a cross-section of service veterans anticipates the proliferation of such instances in the event of disbanded Agniveers being lured by burgeoning PMCs in a business estimated to be worth over $200 billion annually. With the advent of soldiers of fortune and steadily proliferating PMCs – like presently in Ukraine and their recruiters continuously scouting around for trained soldiery – discharged Agniveers would more than adequately fit their mercenary bill.

“There is a more than real possibility of discharged Agniveer’s tapping into the mushrooming Western mercenary and PMC bazaar,” says a retired two-star Indian Army officer. Indians, he says, declining to be named, are nothing if not enterprising and forever partial to jugaad, or creative innovation, especially in earning a fast buck. Moreover, in this ‘highly specialised’ sector daily earnings, centered on experience, expertise and danger potential could average between $500 and $1,500, which is more than incentive enough for an Agniveer to offer his fighting services to the highest bidder in years to come.

According to Sean McFate, one of the world’s leading experts in the US on soldiers of fortune and PMCs, mercenaries are here to stay. New consumers, he stated in an exhaustive paper in late 2019 for the US’s National Defense University, will seek security in an increasingly insecure world, as a consequence of which new mercenaries would emerge to meet this demand. Furthermore, contracting, he states, had become America’s new way of war and trendlines indicated that the US could outsource 80% to 90% of its future wars to PMCs. This, McFate adds, is one of the few issues in Washington that enjoys ‘true bipartisan’ political support with both the Democrats and the Republicans.

Besides, there are no mercenary training camps anywhere, so all such personnel, lionised in Hollywood movies, emanate largely from national military forces. In such an egregious situation, several Indian military officers say Agniveers are ‘ideally suited’ for such employment, as their training and deployment – especially in the Indian Army would be across terrain, which offer diversity like nowhere else. This includes the upper Himalayan reaches, the Rajasthan desert, the flat Punjab plains and the swampy jungles in the northeast. Besides, the Agniveer’s youthfulness and accompanying josh or vigour too would be employable assets.

“Thus, the government needs to consider a protocol or ways to deal with complicated and awkward situations involving ex-armed forces personnel of the kind prevailing in Qatar,” says a former Ministry of Defence (MoD) official.

The moot question that will ultimately need determining is whether the government had extra-terrestrial moral, legal and diplomatic responsibility in coming to the aid of Indian nationals involved in ticklish security situations overseas,” he says, requesting anonymity. This, he adds, is a major predicament even Western nations are still grappling with, but are yet to come up with any prescription."
A Decade of Write-Offs: How the Govt and Banks Failed to Tackle NPAs and Helped Big Corporations,https://m.thewire.in/article/banking/a-decade-of-write-offs-how-the-govt-and-banks-failed-to-tackle-npas-and-helped-big-corporations,"Oct 30, 2023  |  Devidas Tuljapurkar","This article is the fifth in a series on the state of the Indian economy co-curated by the Centre for Financial Accountability, New Delhi and The Wire. Read the first article here, the second here the third here and the fourth here.

The minister of finance and corporate affairs Nirmala Sitaraman has time and again stated that ‘write off’ does not mean relief to the borrower. The rich corporate borrowers, who are usually the beneficiaries of such write-offs by banks, remain liable for repayment and the process of recovery continues, the minister has asserted. Banks continue to pursue recovery actions initiated for written-off accounts through various mechanisms.

When a borrower fails to pay back a loan, it is termed as a non-performing asset (NPA) under conditions laid down by the Reserve Bank of India. But banks are required to compensate for the loans classified as NPAs, an exercise known as ‘provisioning’ in banking terms. This provision is made by setting aside some amount from the bank’s profits on an annual basis as stipulated by the RBI. Over a period with a provision of about 100%, such NPAs are then removed from the asset books of banks and are known as write-offs. Bank professionals or chartered accountants too argue that a write-off is purely a balance sheet exercise, to reduce a bank’s tax liability. They argue that the accounts that are earmarked for write-off are normally 100% provided. Thus while writing off the accounts, banks are not put to loss at least in the balance sheet. But merely compensating for NPAs and bad loans from profits made elsewhere does not take away from the fact that write-offs constitute a huge drain on public money entrusted with banks. In addition, they constitute a bonanza for the big defaulters.

A bonanza for corporate defaulters, a burden on the public

As reported in The Wire, banks have written off Rs 14.56 lakh crore between 2014-15 and 2022-23. The share of large industries and services in the written-off amount is Rs 7,40,968 crore or 48.36%. The amount recovered during the period is a mere Rs 2.05 lakh crore or. 14.07% of the write-offs.

The simple question arising out of these figures is, who pays for the remaining amount of 86% of unrecovered write-offs? It is the respective banks that ultimately bear the burden and this is precisely the reason why banks had to book the losses amounting to Rs 2,07,329 crore successively for five years from 2015-16 to 2019-20.

Even though borrowers continue to be liable for repayment, in practice banks are compelled to forgo any hope of recovery. Thus, in practice, a write-off becomes not only a waiver but a sort of debt relief to the borrowers in which predominantly corporates have a major share. This is shown by how NPAs have been brought down over the last few years.

The amount of provision on account of non-performing assets for the period 2010 to 2015 was Rs 2,43,935 crore, which rose to a whopping Rs 21,48,906 crore for the period 2017 to 2022. This shows that the write-off exercise not only entailed a relief to big borrowers but also involved the transfer of a share of profits towards provisioning for bad loans.

The continued losses booked by banks from 2015-16 to 2019-20 led to an erosion of capital. Thus, from 2016-17 to 2020-21, the government had to infuse more than Rs 3 lakh crore in public sector banks in order to maintain mandated minimum capital. That amount could have been used on education, health and social welfare. The story doesn’t end here.

The present political dispensation at the Centre claims that they have succeeded in tackling the legacy issue of NPAs. The government cites the data that gross NPAs, which were to the tune of rupees 10.21 lakh crore in 2018, have gone down to Rs. 5.55 lakh crore as of 2023. But this reduction has been achieved owing to the write-off of a whopping Rs 10.57 lakh crore.

Mergers of public sector banks benefited corporates

This was the period during which the government resorted to ‘consolidation’ of public sector banks (PSBs). Thus the number of public sector banks has gone down from 27 to 12. As a sequel effect, large-scale closure of the branches of merged entities has taken place, putting customers, especially senior citizens and the poor, in their command areas through unnecessary inconvenience. This consolidation was neither demanded by the customers nor by the shareholders, nor by the employees. As was being argued by the government and some academicians, this was proposed to help reduce administrative costs, increase risk appetite, provide better capitalisation etc. But the same now has proved to be an alibi. Rather, bank consolidation and the formation of bigger entities help corporate borrowers raise finances from a single financial institution. Banks have to adhere to RBI’s stipulated group-specific exposure limit, which refers to the maximum loan as a percentage of its capital base that a bank can offer to a specific business client. Since mergers increase the capital base of the new entity, they allow corporate lenders to seek loans from a lesser number of banks rather than approach many financial institutions to raise money.

Consolidation of PSBs has proved to be a boon for private banks. During the period 2017 to 2022, the number of branches of PSBs has gone down from 91,445 to 84,256 while that of private sector banks has gone up from 24,661 to 37,872. This excludes the 12 small finance banks and six payment banks which have added thousands of branches during 2016-17 to 2020-21. This had an obvious effect on business. As against 2019, in 2023 business of public sector banks has grown by 38.35% while in the case of private sector banks, this growth is by 67.30%, as per data collated by the author. This data speaks for itself. The space which public sector banks have vacated consequent upon consolidation has been occupied by private sector banks and thus it shows that even though banks have not been privatised, banking business is being privatised – which is the main agenda of Indian corporates as also of international finance capital.

The non-solutions of the IBC regime

The government has been claiming that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 has proved to be a game changer. Since its establishment, only 14% of NPA accounts referred to the IBC were resolved through resolution plans. This led to a recovery of 31% of the amount which was due but only with the sacrifice of 69%. The IBC has clearly not proved to be the promised panacea for the NPAs.

Nor has the IBC had a deterrent effect on defaulters. According to data collated by Transunion Cibil, a credit information company, there was a notable increase in the number of wilful defaulter accounts at all ‘credit institutions’ between March 2018 and March 2022. During this period, the count of such accounts rose from 20,066 to 31,026, for loan defaults of Rs 1 crore and above. This signifies a 64.67% uptick in the number of accounts.

Individuals involved in illicit activities within the corporate sector, particularly those seeking to defraud financial institutions, appear to be displaying increased enthusiasm for their wrongful actions. Their growing confidence likely arises from the belief that they can escape legal repercussions. A perception that seems to find support in the contentious circular issued by the RBI on June 8, 2023, that spoke of a framework for compromise settlements and write-offs for wilful defaulters and fraudsters. The RBI was forced to issue a clarification explaining that it had a stand on settlements with wilful defaulters and fraudsters for 15 years!

The lenient approach adopted by both the government and the RBI carries significant implications for evaluating the effectiveness of the IBC.

The past decade stands witness to hollow claims by the government of having tackled the menace of non-performing assets. Rather, the government has bailed out the corporations through rising haircuts, remission and write-offs.

Malay Roychoudhury (1939-2023): The Explosive Poet of India's Hungryalist Movement,https://m.thewire.in/article/culture/malay-roychoudhury-1939-2023-the-explosive-poet-of-indias-hungryalist-movement,"Oct 27, 2023  |  Sreemanti Sengupta","Kolkata: Poet and novelist Malay Roychoudhury, one of Bengal’s best-known counterculture icons, breathed his last in Mumbai on Friday, October 27. He was 84.

A co-founder of the Hungry Generation aka Hungryalist movement, one of India’s major anti-establishment literary ventures, Roychoudhury was one of Independent India’s earliest poets to have faced arrest and undergone trial on obscenity charges.

“The curses that Malay and his friends spewed in their times feel like gold letterings in today’s times,” said writer, film, and literature critic Sanjoy Mukhopadhyay.

Launched by Bengali writers in the early 1960s, Hungryalist literature triggered nationwide debate and influenced anti-establishment literary movements in Hindi, Telugu, and Marathi during the late ‘60s. His writings have been translated into several major Indian languages as well as English, German, French, Spanish, Russian, and Italian.

Born in 1939, Roychoudhury was deeply influenced by the slum culture of Patna’s Imlitala ghetto where he and his elder brother, Samir, grew up. Living in a neighbourhood comprising ‘low caste’ Hindus, Dalits, and Shia Muslims, Roychoudhury developed his literary vocabulary by listening to his neighbour reciting Ghalib and Faiz Ahmed Faiz.

Later, at Ram Mohun Seminary School, a student-cum-librarian initiated him into Marxism and the works of literary stalwarts like Rabindranath Tagore and Jibananda Das. Two servants at their Imlitala house who were well versed in poet Tulsidasa’s Ramcharitmanas and Ramshalaka were also responsible for moulding Roychoudhury’s artistic sensibilities.

Roychoudhury reminisced about his days at Imlitala, his father’s photography studio, and life among the downtrodden in Chotoloker Chotobela, a memoir published by Charchapada in 2012. Chhotolok is an antonym for Bhadrolok, a nomenclature used to describe the upper-caste, English-educated Bengali Hindus. Roychoudhury always insisted that he belonged to the domain of the chhotolok, or the subaltern.

Roychoudhury’s father had sent him away to their house in Patna’s Dariapur locality and the older brother Samir to Chaibasa (now in Jharkhand) so that they would escape Imlitala’s bad reputation of free sex, toddy, cannabis, and hashish. However, building a voice for the lowest of the low became Roychoudhury’s passion when the two brothers were confronted with the post-Partition upheaval, sectarian violence, and refugee crisis.

As Roychoudhury said in a 2023 interview with Evan Kennedy for the New York-based City Lights Bookstore, “I told my brother, let’s raise our voice. We simple people have nothing to do. Let’s print leaflets against the government, the system. Whatever we like, we’ll write, freely.”

The turbulent 1960s

From humble beginnings, the Hungryalist movement gathered momentum when like-minded litterateurs like Shaileswar Ghosh, Debi Roy, Pradip Chaudhuri, Basudeb Dasgupta, Subhas Ghosh, Falguni Roy, and others contributed to the vision and created a unique language of insult and anger against the establishment.

The Hungryalists wanted to write differently and create a language of the subaltern. “To different authorities, we had sent paper masks of Indian gods, jokers, Mickey Mouse, rakshasas. They were really cheap and for children. On the reverse we had printed, ‘Please remove your mask. From Hungry Generation.’ They never thought that these things could come to them,” Roychoudhury said in the interview.

The movement began to attract attention and create controversies from 1963 onwards due to its ruthless verbiage. Allen Ginsberg, one of the pivotal figures of the American Beat Movement, stayed with the Roychoudhury brothers in Patna in 1963. Apart from exchanging literary notes, Ginsberg also took photos of Indian lepers, beggars, and refugees, which angered the poet and his father. Roychoudhury thought Ginsberg was seeing India through the eyes of a common white tourist.

Soon after Ginsberg’s departure, Roychoudhury’s dangerous writings were to change his life unalterably.

It was his 1963 poem “Prachanda Baidyutik Chhutar” (Stark Electric Jesus), which prompted the government’s actions against the Hungryalists.

Oh I’ll die I’ll die I’ll die

My skin is in blazing furor

I do not know what I’ll do where I’ll go oh I am sick

I’ll kick all the Arts in the back and go away Shubha

Shubha let me go and live in your cloaked melon

In the unfastened shadow of dark destroyed saffron curtain

The last anchor is leaving me after I got the other anchors lifted

I can’t resist anymore, million glass-panes are breaking in my cortex

I know, Shubha, spread out your matrix, give me peace

Each vein is carrying a stream of tears up to the heart

Brain’s contagious flints are decomposing out of eternal sickness

Mother why didn’t you give me birth in the form of a skeleton

I’d have gone two billion light years and kissed God’s ass

But nothing pleases me nothing sounds well

I feel nauseated with more than a single kiss

I’ve forgotten women during copulation and returned to Muse

Into the sun-colored bladder

I do not know what these happenings are but they are occurring within me

(An excerpt from Malay Roychoudhury’s “Stark Electric Jesus,” as published in City Lights Journal Number 3 (1966))

After the first Hungry anthology came out in March 1964, police picked up six of them in a string of arrests – Saileshwar Ghosh and Subhas Ghosh from Kolkata; Malay and Samir Roychoudhury from Patna; Pradip Choudhuri from Tripura; and Haradhan Dhara from Howrah. Malay alone underwent trial for ‘obscenity’ in his poem, as the police tried to turn the other accused into approvers against him. However, most of these poets ultimately defended him in court.

While a city sessions court in Kolkata convicted Roychoudhury, he was later acquitted by the Calcutta high court. The entire legal battle lasted nearly three years. The chain of events took Kolkata’s literary sphere by storm.

The Time Magazine reported on the trial in their November 1964 issue, “In a land that has become so straitly laced that its movie heroines must burst into song rather than be kissed, five scruffy young poets were hauled into Calcutta’s dreary Bankshall Court for publishing works that would have melted even Vatsyayana’s pen.”

By 1970, translations of Hungryalist texts appeared in literary periodicals from different parts of the world – Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Germany, France, the UK, and the US. Close to 60 Hungry-influenced magazines were published between the 1960s and ’80s, including Kshudhartha Pratirodh (The Hungry Resistance), Swakal (Our Times), Pphoo (Huh!), Upadruta (Disturbed), Zebra, and Giraffe.

After 1965, the movement fizzled out, beaten out of shape and spirit by the authority’s harsh measures. For a time, Roychoudhury took up a government job at Agriculture, Refinance, and Development Corporation. On his return to literary life two decades later, he won and declined the Sahitya Academic Award for translating Dharamvir Bharati’s Suraj Ka Satwan Ghora into Bengali.

In 1995, Roychoudhury’s literary career took a dramatic turn as he introduced his Adhunantika phase (‘Adhu’ meaning “new”; “Nantik” meaning ‘end’) where he became one of Bengali literature’s pioneering voices in the post-modernist writing style. His poetry collections from this phase are Chitkar Samagra, Chhatrakhan, Ja Lagbey Bolben, Atmadhangser Sahasrabda, Postmodern Ahlader Kobita, and Kounaper Luchimangso. His novels from the period include Namgandho, Jalanjali, Nakhadanta, Ei Adham Oi Adham, and Arup Tomar Entokanta.

Here are some lines from Blood Lyric published in 2011:

“What have I done for poetry plunging into lava-spewing volcano?

What are these? What are these? Result of searches at home

of Poetry? Bromide sepia babies from Dad’s broken almirah

of Poetry! Mom’s Benares sari torn out of hammered box

of Poetry! Breaths are recorded in the seizure list

of Poetry! Show me show me what else is coming out

of Poetry! Shame on you; girl’s half-licked guy! Die you die

of Poetry! Wave piercing sharks chew up flesh & bone”

Roychoudhury continued to be active on the Bengali literary circuit, with books and writings being released regularly in the Kolkata Book Fair and the Little Magazine Fair.

As news of his death broke, the little magazine fraternity of Bengal, India, and abroad took to social media in hoards to express their condolences. Many lamented his loss.

His impact and influence over India’s counter-establishment scenario were beautifully summed up by the late American writer-scholar Howard McCord: “Malay Roy Choudhury, a Bengali poet, has been a central figure in the Hungry Generation’s attack on the Indian cultural establishment since the movement began in the early 1960s. …Acid, destructive, morbid, nihilistic, outrageous, mad, hallucinatory, shrill – these characterise the terrifying and cleansing visions” that “Indian literature must endure if it is to be vital again.”

Malay Roychoudhury is survived by his wife Shalila Roychoudhury, his daughter Anushree Prashant, son Jitendra and two grandchildren.

"Indians’ Personal Data Breached Yet Again, but No Sign That Gaps Will Be Plugged",https://m.thewire.in/article/tech/indians-personal-data-breached-yet-again-but-no-sign-that-gaps-will-be-plugged,"Oct 30, 2023  |  Srinivas Kodali","India is rapidly digitising. There are good things and bad, speed-bumps on the way and caveats to be mindful of. The weekly column Terminal focuses on all that is connected and is not – on digital issues, policy, ideas and themes dominating the conversation in India and the world.

Resecurity, a US cybersecurity firm, published a blog in early October pointing towards a general trend of the personal data of Indians being sold over the dark web. The firm found that a threat actor had advertised the sale of close to 815 million Aadhaar records for $80,000. The blog, citing other instances when Indians’ personal information was put up for sale, raised concerns about identity theft.

A threat actor with the alias ‘pwn0001’ claimed that they could sell records of 815 million Indians, including names, ages, phone numbers, Aadhaar numbers and addresses. pwn0001 shared a sample, which had 1 lakh phone numbers and Aadhaar numbers. The sample dataset includes personal information of children as young as 10. It is yet unclear from which database the records of 81.5 crore Indians, including children’s Personally Identifiable Information (PII), have been breached.

A News18 report claims that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s database was breached. The report also claims Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has informed ICMR of the breach and it has to verify it. If this indeed proves to be the case, it is unclear why ICMR would have details of 10-year-olds.

The push to link Aadhaar cards to everything has proliferated the personal data of Indians across cyberspace, among various public and private firms. There are a few databases with such large-scale personal data of Indians, but it is uncertain which database would have been breached. While the sample dataset can help us verify the genuineness of the data that has been put up for sale, it would still be hard to verify the source.

Resecurity points to another threat actor with the alias “Lucius”, who has put up Indian law enforcement data for sale. According to Lucius, 85% of Indians’ personal data – including phone numbers, identity documents and addresses – are available in this dataset for sale. The sample dataset shared by Lucius indicates KYC data of mobile connections with columns for prepaid and postpaid being available in the dataset.

Resecurity’s analysis shows that as data sharing is forced on Indians, more threat actors will be able to access large-scale PII data. This is not a new trend for many Indians, who have been used to hearing news of Aadhaar data breaches. What is evident, though, is that the scale of the breach and the size of the data are growing. This trend too can be attributed to the proliferation of Aadhaar across India’s data economy.

The US cybersecurity firm is primarily concerned with the associated identity fraud that will follow these large-scale data breaches – online banking fraud, tax refund fraud and other financial crimes. Aadhaar-based frauds have become quite common in India and yet, the regulator won’t address the problem at hand. UIDAI has virtually ignored the Aadhaar data leaks, while promising us a virtual ID solution that disappeared after the litigation around Aadhaar concluded in the Supreme Court.

Identifying the breach and plugging it would be important to critically address the issue of cybersecurity and safety for Indians. October is celebrated as “CyberSecurity Awareness Month” by CERT-In. Yet, we don’t really get much cybersecurity awareness other than basic tips and tricks. The cybersecurity landscape is fast changing with increasing data breaches and we need CERT-In to provide actual solutions instead of following a “security-through-obscurity” model.

There is no panic or hysteria surrounding this breach. The inaction and continuous forcing of Aadhaar against the Supreme Court’s orders are concerning. Indians deserve better cybersecurity than what is currently in place. The implementation of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 can address some of these issues but as long as government exemptions remain, data for government networks will continue to be breached.

For true safety, Indians need to be provided with privacy. Instead, we are only offered security in terms of data protection. Even this promise of data protection is faulty, with no actual resources being allocated towards cybersecurity operations. India’s current paradigm of security doesn’t address the emerging challenges people are facing. UIDAI, the RBI, CERT-In and the information technology ministry should all at least acknowledge what is at stake when they force Aadhaar on Indians.

"‘Religious Persecution’, ‘Lack of Jobs’: A Record Number of Indians Are Illegally Crossing the US Border",https://m.thewire.in/article/world/religious-persecution-lack-of-jobs-a-record-number-of-indians-are-illegally-crossing-the-us-border,"Oct 30, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: Nearly 42,000 migrants from India have crossed the southern border illegally during the fiscal year starting last October through September, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing data compiled by US Customs and Border Protection.

According to the report, that is more than double the number from the same period the previous year, when the number of Indians crossing the US border illegally hit a historic high.

From October 2021 to September 2022, US border authorities stopped Indian migrants “18,300 times” at the US southern border, DW had reported, citing the Migration Policy Institute’s 2022 report. In the previous year, 2,600 such encounters were recorded by the US authorities, the report said.

In September alone, 8,076 Indians were arrested by US’s law enforcement agencies when they tried to enter the country illegally through various routes. Of the total, 3,059 Indians were arrested from the US-Canada border alone, data from the US Customs and Border Protection showed.

Since 2007, the total number of illegal border crossings by Indians in a fiscal year has exceeded 5,000 only four times. Indians nearly all turn themselves in to Border Patrol, rather than being arrested while evading capture, because they want to ask for asylum in the US, WSJ reported.

Roughly 80% of the migrants from India are single adults, the report said. Most of them come through Arizona after taking “donkey flights” via countries that don’t require visas for Indian nationals, or that have an easier process for obtaining travel visas, it added.

An upcoming Bollywood film, Dunki, directed by Rajkumar Hirani, and starring Shah Rukh Khan, is based on these “donkey flights”, which are used for illegal immigration to the US.

The report highlighted the increasing number of Indian migrants illegally crossing the US.

Diego Piña Lopez, director of Casa Alitas, a nonprofit that helps migrants, told WSJ that his shelter has had to rethink dietary restrictions and consider religious and cultural differences, given the large number of Indian migrants they are now seeing.

“It used to be an annual thing that in the summers we would see small pockets of people coming from India,” he said. “Now we are seeing people from India almost every day.”

Deepak Ahluwalia, an immigration lawyer who is representing Arshdeep Singh, who was compelled to leave India after he was threatened by men allegedly affiliated to the Bharatiya Janata Party, told WSJ that he’s seeing an increasing number of political and religious persecution asylum cases from India, with a notable rise within the Sikh community.

Another reason for Indians illegally migrating to the US is a “lack of economic opportunities” in their own country, the report noted."

On October 26, the Court of First Instance in Qatar sentenced eight former Indian Navy officers, who had been working for a private company, to death. The Indian Ministry of External said that it was “deeply shocked” by the judgment and was looking at all legal options.

The charges against the eight Indian nationals have not been made public, but as per media reports they were detained on suspicion of passing down classified information to a third country.

After the sentencing, the sister of one of the former Indian navy officers made an appeal to the Indian prime minister.

“We couldn’t come to terms with what we heard as my brother, Commander Purnendu Tiwari, who happens to be a decorated naval veteran has done no wrong and is innocent. We plead to our Prime Minister to intervene and bring back our officers,’’ Meetu Bhargava told The New Indian Express.

Purnendu Tiwari is also a recipient of the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman award for his contribution towards capacity building of the Qatari Navy.

Besides Tiwari, the other men are Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma, Captain Saurabh Vasisht, Commodore Amit Nagpal, Commodore Sugunakar Pakala, Commodore Sanjeev Gupta and Sailor Ragesh.

Amit Nagpal’s brother Vikas Nagpal has also started a signature campaign to seek public support for the release of all the eight veterans.

“The lack of transparency and due process in this case is deeply concerning as it undermines faith in legal systems globally. This petition aims to bring attention to this grave issue and seeks justice for these individuals who have served their country honourably. Please sign this petition and support our cause for justice, fairness, and respect for human rights,” said the petition.

It also urged the Indian government “to intervene at the highest level and secure their release”.

The petition noted that the former naval officers had been sentenced to death “without any public disclosure of the allegations against them or sharing of proof”. “They were held in solitary confinement for nearly a year without filing of charges, an act that is not only unjust but also violates basic human rights,” it stated."
"In WTO, US Questions India About 'Import Licenses' for Electronics",https://m.thewire.in/article/trade/wto-us-questions-india-import-licenses-electronics,"Oct 28, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: The United States has asked India to give details on why it is collecting data from importers on its “importing license requirement” for laptops, tablets and computers which will be operational from November 1 and if this regime will be expanded to other imports.

The Hindu Businessline reported the US made a representation to the World Trade Organisation’s committee on import licensing on October 19.

In early August, India notified import restrictions on laptops, tablets, and certain types of computers with immediate effect for security reasons and the need to promote domestic manufacturing. As per the notice, importers of these items would need permission or license from the government for their inbound shipments.

A day later, on August 4, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade announced that implementation has been deferred till November 1, reportedly to allow the industry to adjust.

As per media reports, the government’s decision to restrict imports was to encourage Indian manufacturers since electronic imports accounted for $19.7 billion between April and June 2023.

With several large companies directly impacted by the restrictions, the government had to make some relaxations. On October 19, India unveiled a new liberal online authorisation system designed to automatically grant import authorisations once importers input the details regarding the value, volume, and source country of their intended imports.

These authorisations, which come with no quantity or source restrictions, will remain valid until September 30, 2024. Officials say the data collected during this monitoring period would inform future policy decisions.

The US representation to WTO noted that on September 26, Indian authorities “announced that on November 1, 2023, importers will only be required to register on an ‘import management system’ in order to import regulated products”. “However, no change was made to the original notification (of August 3),” they said.

In its official representation, the United States requested that India provide details on the data to be gathered and its intended purpose. “Will the information impact the process for granting licenses? Is India considering the use of quantitative restrictions based on the information supplied?” it stated, as quoted by The Hindu Businessline.

The United States also inquired whether India intended to broaden the scope of import licensing beyond the specified products, whether it had issued a public notification and allowed for a period of public comment before the announcement."
"Global Economy Survived Ukraine War, but Can It Shrug Off Israel Strife?",https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/global-economy-ukraine-war-israel-strife,"Oct 28, 2023  |  M.K. Venu","India’s stock market index has lost nearly 5% over the last six days as global markets also turned jittery over the possible consequences of the Israel-Hamas war. The emerging market stock indices were already weakening for about 12 weeks before the Hamas attack, as weakness in the global economy seemed to persist.

A perfect storm is building as crude prices harden and the US dollar strengthens on the back of very high 10-year bond yields, which have touched 5%, which was last seen in 2007 before the global financial crisis. High bond yields signal higher inflationary expectations. Given this background, there is little likelihood of the Federal Reserve pausing its interest rate hike cycle anytime soon. India’s RBI too has indicated that inflation will have to be watched more carefully, following the Hamas-Israel war and its potential spread to the broader West Asia region. This is not particularly good news for ruling regimes across the world which are approaching general elections.

The markets may not take kindly to Israel’s excessive bellicosity towards UN Secretary General António Guterres, who is pressing for the observance of international law and the rules of war. The markets are psychologically impacted by words used by top global leaders.

In Ukraine, 9,600 civilians were killed over 18 months. In Gaza already 7,000 plus civilians are dead in a few weeks in the most destructive bombing in a short period.

For instance, US President Joe Biden advising Israel to eschew rage in its response may have caused nervousness in the markets. If Israel continues to act aggressively over the next few weeks, sharpening the brinkmanship between the Western powers and the Iran-Russia-China axis, one could well witness another round of spikes in inflation and interest rates globally.

Some reputed Wall Street analysts have made the contrarian argument that the markets are taking the Israel-Hamas war in their stride and there is some optimism that it won’t spread to the larger region. Perhaps this optimism flows from the manner in which the Russia-Ukraine war avoided the worst economic consequences simply because nations ranged against each other chose to minimise damage by letting Russian oil come into markets via the backdoor. Surely there was an economic backlash in terms of the hardening inflation and interest rates, but the worst-case scenario was avoided.

There is hope that a similar cycle may play out during a prolonged Israel-Palestine conflict. It is true that the powerful political-business elites in the US, Europe, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Israel are heavily invested in global financial assets and their instinct would be to minimise economic damage. But as President Biden observed, any response characterised by rage and vengefulness could upset such rational calculations. The collective market intelligence is well aware of this, too. Things can easily spiral out of control in a war that increasingly becomes part of big powers rivalry. Such accidents do occur in history. Hence the continuing nervousness seen in the behaviour of stocks, bonds, crude and gold, all of which can have a profound impact on the real economy. India will not be insulated from this. A lot of foreign institutional money has left the Indian stock market in the past several weeks. Foreign equity money is leaving most emerging markets in search of safer investment options. US bonds are seen as offering good risk-free returns.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) into India has also slowed down considerably because events like Ukraine and Gaza urge global investors to hold back until there is clarity on what is likely to happen in the near future. India’s foreign trade ― both imports and exports ― has slowed sharply in the last quarter, reflecting shrinking economic activity. Imports and exports together constitute nearly 50% of India’s GDP. PM Modi and his economic policy advisors were hoping that private sector investment would finally pick up after nine years of drought in new corporate investments. But negative global events ― first in Ukraine and now in West Asia ― seem to have put another spoke into the possibilities of any meaningful recovery in the global economy. India will also likely see a holding operation in the coming months as the nation prepares for the Lok Sabha elections in 2024."
Will India’s Domestic Industrial Policy Help Integration With Global Value Chain?,https://m.thewire.in/article/business/india-domestic-industrial-policy-global-value-chain,"Oct 28, 2023  |  Saon Ray","Industrial policy, the idea that the government can play a significant role in building out parts of the economy for various purposes, is back globally. The United States Inflation Reduction Act is the prime example, using state subsidies, tax breaks, loans, and grants to support industries that the US has deemed strategic. India, too, is no stranger to this trend. India introduced Production Linked Incentives in 2020, providing a financial boost to firms that expanded their manufacturing within the country, starting with three industries – pharmaceutical, electronics, and medical devices – and then expanding them to cover many more sectors.

But how do these domestic-focused policies fit into broader efforts to integrate into the “global value chain” and the “diversified, democratic” re-globalisation that India has called for?

To understand, we have to go back to the COVID-19 pandemic and the discourse around the global value chain that emerged at the time. The ripple effects of disruptions caused by the pandemic brought home the characteristics of a globalised world that obtains many items of consumption through the global value chain. The important question then turned to the risks associated with these chains and their resilience.

Until recently, countries were trying to integrate into existing global value chains. Global value chain participation generally brings economic benefits in terms of enhanced productivity as well as greater sophistication and diversification of exports. Consequently, understanding what determines participation in global value chains has implications for policymaking. Yet the gains from value chain participation vary significantly between countries.

Typically, integration in global value chains is captured through backward and forward linkages. Backward linkages measure how an economy imports intermediate goods or services as inputs in the production of its own exports, while forward linkages refer to inputs provided by one country to another, which, in turn, produces consumer goods that are further exported to third countries.

In recent times, many countries have resorted to industrial policy to decouple from over-reliance on certain trading partners. But how do we make sense of these production networks in the context of India?

Integration

Global value chains are networked through lead firms, usually major multinational companies that play key roles in building these value chains. From a country’s point of view, belonging to these chains leads to networks and exports. Global value chain participation is dependent on a variety of factors, including the size and location of a country, its manufacturing share in GDP, and trade and investment policies. A country’s global value chain integration matters due to the nature of trade, which, since the mid-1960s, has increasingly been in intermediate goods – the inputs that are used in the production process that lead to final consumer goods. Certain factors like lowering transport costs, easing tariffs, and technological advancements in transport have led to an increase in trade in intermediates whereby value is added in each subsequent stage in factories located in different countries. This has led to regions or countries producing and specialising in certain goods and the moniker of “Factory Asia” for electronic products. On the other hand, not belonging to these chains means it is difficult for countries to break into export markets.

Lead firms

Along with these, the role of lead firms is important. Lead firms have been defined as small, medium, or large firms that have forward or backward linkages with a large number of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). A lead firm governs the whole of a value chain.

The emergence of lead firms and global value chain participation depends on factors that lead to a conducive business environment, attracting foreign investment, and internationalisation of domestic firms. Internationalisation of domestic firms can be done when they start exporting to international buyers and through imports of intermediates by domestic final producers. Global value chains in manufacturing can better contribute to employment creation, skills upgrading, and other benefits associated with manufacturing-led industrialisation. Across this ecosystem, there is a desire to create an environment that supports local manufacturers as they attempt to upgrade their productive capabilities and increase their competitiveness.

However, many domestic firms in developing countries, especially MSMEs, do not integrate into global value chains easily, and face challenges in global value chain participation. The rise in South-South trade has made local and regional value chains more important for developing countries.

The global value chain literature stresses the role lead firms (such as global buyers) play in supporting producers’ learning and innovation activities in less developed countries by transferring knowledge to their suppliers. However, it has been noted that while these firms generally outsource “commodity-like” activities that add little value, they retain direct control over intangible, high value-added activities as opposed to low value-added activities. Hence, the transfer of knowledge occurs more through certain activities or tasks and certain industries.

While upgrading to high value-added activities can raise domestic labour productivity and skills, developing countries are often locked in low value-added activities with little or no technology transfer. Upgrading is defined as “strategies that firms, countries, or regions implement to move toward higher value-added activities and increased value capture.” The role of leading firms becomes critical in this context.

From a policy perspective, how global value chains integrate into the economy is critical and the role of the lead firm is vital. Also, the role of industrial and other policies in encouraging global value chain integration and upgrading is significant.

Whither industrial policy?

Industrial policy is at the heart of development policy and has often taken various names (e.g., export facilitation, promotion of foreign investment, or free trade zones). It is not only about incentives given to manufacturing industries but also those given to services or agriculture.

Theoretically, the argument for industrial policy stems from market failure. Economist Dani Rodrik argues that the need for industrial policy is theoretically sound and well-articulated. It can address market failures, but it is difficult to implement in practice. As he explains, the conventional case for industrial policy is due to market failures in markets for credit, labour, products, or knowledge.

There are two main objections to industrial policy in practice, according to Rodrik. One is information asymmetry and the other is corruption and rent-seeking. In the first case, it is impossible for governments to identify winners in firms, sectors, or markets that are impacted by imperfect markets – yet industrial policy, in some ways, forces them to. Secondly, it is argued that industrial policy often leads to corruption or rent-seeking. There are arguments on the empirical evaluation of industrial policy by both the proponents and opponents of industrial policy. Proponents suggest that in many instances, usually backed by case-based evidence, industrial policy works.

India’s integration and industrial policy

Despite India’s manufacturing prowess, especially in medium-tech industries, its participation in global value chains remains limited. Moreover, India’s participation in global value chains is largely concentrated in a few industries (e.g. automobiles). India has also been losing its share of exports in labour-intensive products, especially garments.

Also, in the case of India, while product upgrading (defined as the movement into higher value-added products within a global value chain) and process upgrading (which involves increased productivity in existing activities within a global value chain) have occurred, functional upgrading (which involves the movement into more technologically sophisticated or more integrated aspects of a production process) and intersectoral upgrading has been limited. This has been the case in garments. Inter-sectoral or chain upgrading involves a move into higher value-added supply chains.

Developing countries can better stimulate their integration into global value chains and increase the development benefits from multi-national company activities in their economies by aligning their policies to attract Foreign Direct Investment. The typology of industrial policies that countries can follow in enhancing global value chain participation includes three sets of policies. These are horizontal policies that affect the entire national economy (e.g. the Goods and Services Tax), vertical industrial policies that are targeted at particular sectors or industries (e.g. Automotive Mission Plan 2016-26 for the automobile industry), and finally, global value chain-oriented policies.

This last type of policy could include the possibility of upgrading and improving the links across different segments of the value chain. India’s policy approach has been largely addressing logistical and infrastructure bottlenecks and improving the ease of doing business, and can be classified in terms of horizontal or vertical. However, what is needed for greater integration is global value chain-oriented policies.

Industrial policy 2.0

In recent times, there has been a resurgence of industrial policy, such as the Inflation Reduction Act of the United States and, in the Indian context, the recent production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes. These policies have been announced for fourteen sectors and could be extended to more in the future. They are India’s newest set of industrial policies after the earlier “Make in India” programme. Through these schemes, India is trying to attract FDI and create “champion firms.”

The new Foreign Trade Policy announced earlier this year has the objective of integrating India into global value chains and making India an export hub. It is in this context that we need to see the PLI schemes aimed at improving the international competitiveness of the firms and increasing the localisation of Indian industries. The PLI schemes should also be seen in the context of global value chain-oriented policies aimed at increasing India’s global value chain integration. By trying to create champion firms, these policies are trying to pick “winners” which is in line with the objectives of industrial policy. However, it remains to be seen whether these firms will also become lead firms.

In line with the policy announcements, the tariffs on imported inputs have been increased to promote indigenous manufacturing. While these may work in the long run, in sectors where there is no capacity (e.g. solar panels, EV batteries), the cost of production increases in the short run. What India is trying—through a combination of PLI schemes and import tariffs – is to create a larger part of the production chain within the country.

If successful, India will have built a successful indigenous manufacturing base capable of exporting, too. On the other hand, if the manufacturing of the inputs does not become globally competitive despite the tariff protection, India will have lost the chance to integrate even the downstream industry into the value chains of “Factory Asia.” The distinction between industrial policy and import substitution needs to be understood. Import substitution can lead to greater reliance on domestically produced intermediates – thereby promoting indigenous manufacturing – but need not lead to greater global value chain integration. Hence, the objective of greater integration with global value chains through the PLI schemes is uncertain. Whether these policies will propel India’s manufacturing sector and help overcome the “jobless growth” remains to be seen.

Backstory: What Was the Indian Media Doing When a Genocide Was Playing Out in Gaza?,https://m.thewire.in/article/media/backstory-what-was-the-indian-media-doing-when-a-genocide-was-playing-out-in-gaza,"Oct 28, 2023  |  Pamela Philipose","The horrendous Hamas incursion into Israel which targeted civilians, including women, children and the elderly, will remain in global consciousness as a crime against humanity.

What swiftly followed those brutal assaults of October 7 was the unremitting aerial bombing of Gaza, killing thousands of unarmed people, including women, children and the elderly, as part of Israel’s drive to seek “justice”.

There is a back story here of colonisation, forced expulsion of Palestinians and the capture of their land. It has remained a blot on the West which had sought to assuage its guilt over the Nazi atrocities perpetrated on the Jews by making the Palestinians, who had no role in the Holocaust, pay the greatest price for it through the establishment of the Jewish state of Israel on Palestinian soil. Over time, Israel evolved into a settler colonial apartheid state, capturing more and more of Palestinian land through untold, militarised repression until it has become what it is today: a nuclear power with one of the world’s most powerful armies, enabled by the steady drip of $3.8 billion from the US pouring in as military aid every year.

There was a time when this back story was known in India; there was a time when the Indian political establishment extended solidarity to the Palestinian cause. That time has long passed and nothing indicated this better than India having abstained from a UNGA resolution on October 27, calling for an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza. Remember, that three-day visit to Israel that Narendra Modi made in 2017 – the first Indian prime minister to do so? And how he followed it up with a three-hour visit to Ramallah the next year? The brevity of the latter visit and the statement which emanated from it signalled to the world that the careful balance India had hitherto maintained in its relations between the two entities had ended. Today, India is one of Israel’s most crucial trading partners. More relevant, it is the largest purchaser of Israel-made arms, apart from surveillance technology (‘Import Data Shows IB Bought Hardware From Israel Matching Kit Used for Pegasus, OCCRP Says’, The Wire, October 20, 2022). It has also emerged as the Indian establishment’s most favoured model for military and police deployment.

Cultural and media ties between the two countries have grown apace. The Mumbai attacks of 2008, which included strikes on the Chabad Lubavitch establishment, were something of a tipping point. That story had many facets which resonated in the country. An Indian nanny who rescued a toddler from the attackers became a major news point. Even more pervasive was the projection of the “common threat of terror from hostile neighbours”. The Modi years have seen this slant acquire a seriously communal tone, playing as it does to the anti-Muslim ideological project of Hindutva. It is this trope that once again seems to be reflected in Modi’s tweet on October 7: “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour.”

Israel was quick to respond to this warmth and before long ‘India is with Israel’, was not just trending on X (formerly Twitter) but came to reflect a larger global common sense. Despite a later attempt at publicly acknowledging the suffering of the Palestinians, and the dispatch of humanitarian aid to Gaza, the well-defined reality is that ‘India is with Israel’.

This has been deepened by two layers of media coverage: first, the social media blitzkrieg in support of Israel after the October Hamas attacks and second, the embedding of major television channels within the Israeli army information machinery.

Coming to the first aspect, the surge of pro-Israeli, pro-bombardment sentiment from online Indians signals a major internationalisation of the Hindu nationalist troll. The Wire analysis, ‘How Pro-BJP WhatsApp, Facebook Groups Are Using the Israel-Hamas War to Stoke Islamophobia’ (October 25), points to four broad trends in their posts and tweets. They range from “dehumanising Palestinian suffering and delegitimising support for them, to making the Israel-Gaza war relatable by drawing historical Indian comparisons to it, to warning Hindus about an Islamist attack and pitching the BJP and Modi as the country’s only hope to fight this.”The last aspect is particularly important in this pre-election phase of Indian politics, where the ruling party is seizing every opportunity to expand Modi’s personal appeal.

Disinformation is a crucial ingredient in these posts. De-contextualised videos are central to the campaign. Instances have been cited of old videos repurposed for anti-Palestine propaganda, as for instance one of young girls in Jerusalem framed as “sex slaves”. The success of such efforts hinges crucially on the receptivity of their audiences. A Wire comment (‘As Israel Kills Thousands of Palestinian Civilians, We Need to Pay Attention to the Language of ‘War’’, October 26) underlines this: “Pernicious hatred for Muslims is the glue which binds them with the Israeli narrative.”

The question I want to ask, while coming to the second aspect, is this: When did channels like Times Now and India Today get embedded in the Israeli army? Some 20 days after the October 7 attack, when Gaza was witnessing genocide, they were still flogging the broken window panes and rotting potatoes left behind in a deserted kibbutz. There was some kind of competition between these two channels: if one had discovered the potatoes earlier, the other reported there were potatoes and fruit left behind. Their coverage could have been termed pure burlesque if it hadn’t been so dangerously the media equivalent of Nero.

The script they used sometimes appeared to be expanded social media posts. “What really happened? Because of the heavy rocket fire from Hamas… look at the glass, look at the roof. This means they tried to target each and every person in the house… Look at the condition here. The streets are almost deserted. Nobody is here… Some shoes are lying here, uniforms…”

There were some truly cringe-worthy moments as well. One correspondent while interviewing Israeli MP, Sharren Haskel, slipped in a little speech about how “India has been a victim of Pakistani terror too.” He then went back to ask her what Israel was doing to strike at the root of Hamas. Haskel, nothing loathe, launched into a description of Iran as the “head of the snake”.

The coverage was so over-the-top; so out of whack with journalistic methods and ethics, that it appeared at times to be pure, old-fashioned paid news. In fact, their own script indicated that all the information they were putting out came directly from Israel Defence Forces (IDF) sources. The Times Now reporter revealed that he had been given a manual by Israel with images which were televised promptly for Indian audiences. His India Today counterpart was handed over a tape comprising 43 minutes of footage of the Hamas attacks. Going through it, he said, was one of the most harrowing experiences of his life. He then proceeded to describe each frame, the chants of “Allahu Akbar”, the killing of a black Labrador, a man being killed before his two sons… “What I saw – completely charred infants. Women with gunshot wounds…” An audio tape of a Hamas operative talking excitedly to his parents about having killed ten Israelis and the father congratulating him was telecast over and over again, just as were the visuals from the Kibbutz Be’eri and the site of the Tribe of Nova Music Festival. What was striking about them was that they were essentially vignettes – the entire flow of each event was completely lost to the viewer.

This is not intended to underestimate the horrendous nature of the October 7 attacks, but as an argument for reporting the story as it needed to be reported, because even as these gentlemen told their recycled news stories, day after day, Gaza was being bombed to a stage when living, breathing people were visibly at death’s door. Yet the horror in Gaza remained a small sideshow in their news tableaux.

We understand that these channels could not report from Gaza, but what stopped them from uprooting themselves from Kibutz Be’eri and talking to the Palestinian refugees in Jordan, for instance? The media of even Israel’s closest allies never stooped to this level of completely one-sided coverage. The Western media were controlled without doubt, they were deeply biased towards Israel clearly, but somewhere journalistic professionalism was not completely abandoned.

A time will come when the Indian media will be left facing a deeply uncomfortable question: What were you doing when a genocide was playing out in Gaza?

Release Prabir Purkayastha and Amit Chakravarty

Does every generation have to face an emergency? This is a question raised by Prabir Purkayastha in his new book (written before his recent incarceration), Keeping Up The Good Fight From the Emergency to the Present Day. The emergency then and the situation now, he describes, as a “destructive situation that develops if the political dispensation of the time erodes people’s fundamental rights in numerous ways”. The erosion can take several forms. Yet, if you want to “muzzle a million or more people, you cannot use the Emergency instrument, which was direct censorship… The new censors – official and unofficial – make an example of a few to create a chilling effect.”

This precisely was what the swoop on nearly 50 journalists and associates of the news portal, NewsClick on October 3, aimed to do. It revealed to us once again that the “new censors” – in this case the Special Cell of the Delhi Police – are riding roughshod over the fundamental rights of citizens with absolute impunity in order to send out their chilling message.

Violation of privacy was arguably one of the most distressing aspects of that raid. Here we are speaking not just about their personal privacy – the incursion into their homes, the ransacking and seizure of books, documents and personal papers – but their digital privacy. Devices like mobile phones, laptops, and desktops – critical for journalistic work and the protection of sources – were taken away. The asymmetric power between police personnel and the ordinary citizen is so stark that most of those so raided surrendered without demur sensitive information like pin numbers and passwords of their digital devices, along with the devices themselves.

The standard practice is that once seized, devices are rarely returned. This was why the recent court judgment in The Wire case, ordering the police to release devices taken from the homes of its editors and managers a year ago, is so important. The court ruled that devices, for which mirror images were anyway available with the police, cannot be kept indefinitely by the investigating officer “only on the speculation of an uncertain future event/discovery.”

What is at stake here is a violation of the Puttaswamy verdict delivered by a nine-judge Supreme Court bench in 2017, which recognised digital privacy as well:

“Most modern notions of privacy in the digital age use the term ‘privacy’ as shorthand to refer to a bundle of several concomitant rights over personal information – the right of access, the right of erasure, the right to have a say in the manner of its processing, the right of accuracy, the right of control of third-party access, etc.” (‘Device Seizures Are Making a Mockery of The Supreme Court’s Landmark Privacy Ruling’, October 17).

Madhavi Goradia Divan, in a recent newspaper comment, cites the Virendra Khanna vs State of Karnataka judgment, which set down how mobile records must be investigated. It ruled that the investigating officer must first seek court directions and emphasised that there must be reasonable ground for believing that it is necessary to carry out such a search.

The NewsClick raids only make more crucial the issues raised in the Puttaswamy and Virendra Khanna verdicts. Now a petition by five academics is slated to come up before the Supreme Court in the first week of November. They have urged the court to draw up norms under which search and seizure operations by the police and law enforcement agencies can be conducted.

Meanwhile, the chilling message sent to journalists by those raids continues to linger. A Delhi court has ordered that Prabir Purkayastha and human resources department head Amit Chakravarty, who is disabled and suffering gravely, remain in police custody in a completely fallacious case accusing them of spreading Chinese propaganda.

Journalists across the country are following both cases very closely because it is a matter of their human and professional rights.

Radha Kumar, policy analyst and author, comments on the repression against NewsClick: “The appalling arrests of Prabir Purkayastha and Amit Chakrabarty under the UAPA is the latest of a series of attacks on the freedom of the media. I hope all opposition parties will now pledge to defend the independence of media, such as NewsClick, and withdraw the UAPA and similar laws that are used to victimise human rights defenders.”

Solidarity with Palestine

Khushi Kabir, advisor, sent in this statement of Sangat, a South Asian Feminist Network: “Sangat, a feminist network representing women from different countries in South Asia, stands against the genocide in Gaza. Thousands of innocent civilians have been killed by the aggression carried out by Israeli Occupation Forces.

“We acknowledge and share the pain and horror of the families, victims, and hostages of the October 7 violence by Hamas. This action by Palestinian resistance has to be seen in light of the atrocities the citizens of brutally occupied Gaza have been subjugated to in all these years. It has been nothing but an open prison with severe restrictions on food, water, livelihood, and mobility. Palestinians in Gaza have been treated as less than humans, totally violating their human rights.

“We are alarmed by the support of various heads of state for the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, despite his declared strategy for eradicating and annihilating the Palestinian people through an immoral war. We are particularly concerned about the genocidal pitched statements from Netanyahu and his lawmakers and the extremely racist and dehumanised language used to describe the Palestinian people and the ongoing wanton military assault on the people of Gaza…

“We call for an end to the offensive of the Government of Israel on innocent men, women, and children. We demand an immediate end to what is a humanitarian catastrophe and reiterate that intentional starvation of the civilian population is a crime against humanity, which is being committed against the people of Gaza with total impunity. A humanitarian corridor must be opened immediately, and electricity and water must be reinstated.

“We urgently demand that the leaders of nations supporting Israel understand that what is unfolding is a genocide. There can be no excuse ever for violence with this intent. Support for it is clearly indicative of a brutal colonial mindset. Revenge is not justice… We call for the institution of proper mechanisms for accountability and justice to end this culture of immunity and impunity for violations of International Humanitarian Law.

“Sangat believes that the feminist struggle for social justice, equality, human rights, and peace includes a people’s right to self- determination, and we join our Palestinian sisters, brothers, and allies across the world in condemning this ongoing genocidal war and call for an immediate ceasefire by the Israeli Government.”

Sathyanand from the CPI Bangalore District Committee: “Protestors of the Left parties speaking out against Israel atrocities in Palestine were arrested by Bangalore police in Freedom Park. The permission was denied on the pretext of lack of space in Freedom Park. However, the real reason is that the police have been instructed to stop any protests in favour of the Palestinian people. We condemn the high-handed attitude of the State government to stifle all voices in favour of the Palestinian people. We condemn the Central government’s support of Israel and the dilution of our historic support for Palestine. We stand firmly in favour of an immediate ceasefire and the immediate implementation of the two-state formula.”

The real reason for October 7 attack

M.K. Shah sent this in: “According to Ilan Berman, senior vice president of the think tank of the American Council on Foreign Relations, Hamas and Islamic Jihad want to stop the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia and launched the October 7 terrorist attacks. This may be true but they may have also signed their own death warrants as well as those of thousands more Palestinians.”

How can Indians behave this way?

Pradip Biswas writes in: “Today, I feel afresh, that cricket matches between India and Pakistan are nothing but a way to spark wild frenzy which could end up in communal clashes. The way our idiot boxes play the occasion in order to raise hate against the Muslim community is a direct fallout of the fundamentalism being practised by the RSS and BJP. This vexes me to the bone. If a cricket match between India and Pakistan sparks such mental ‘fury’, nothing can be more inhuman. When such ghastly scenes are beamed all over the country for a game, a sport, what can one say? We boast of being a federal democracy but what is shown is the barbarian psychology of our people at its worst. I lose hope.”

India Refuses to Back Landslide UN General Assembly Call for Humanitarian Truce in Gaza,https://m.thewire.in/article/world/india-refuses-to-back-landslide-un-general-assembly-call-for-humanitarian-truce-in-gaza,"Oct 28, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: Even as heavy airstrikes accompanied Israel’s announcement of “expanded” ground operations in the Gaza strip and the number of Palestinians killed by the Israeli military crossed 7,000, India abstained on a resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly calling for a humanitarian truce, choosing not to back the international community’s demand that there be an immediate halt to the violence.

The resolution garnered 120 affirmative votes, while only 14 countries, including Israel, the United States, Hungary and five Pacific island states, voted against. India was among the 45 countries – most from the Western military bloc – that chose to abstain in the vote at an emergency session of the UNGA in New York on Friday afternoon.

India was the only stand out in South Asia, with all the other seven nations voting in favour of the resolution.

The Jordanian-proposed resolution called for a humanitarian “truce” and emphasized the importance of adhering to international humanitarian law. It urged the unconditional release of all captive civilians and unhindered supply of essential provisions to Gaza.

It was sponsored by many Arab and Islamic countries, including key states like Egypt, Oman and UAE. Russia also sponsored the resolution.

India was also among those countries which unsuccessfully voted in favour of a West-backed draft amendment that sought to explicitly condemn Hamas by name.

The Canadian proposed amendment, backed by the United States and the West, sought to introduce language specifically condemning Hamas and the taking of hostages. The amendment received 88 votes in favour, 55 against, and 23 abstentions. However, it was not adopted because it did not secure the necessary two-thirds majority of votes from the members ‘present and voting’. Nations who abstain are counted as not voting.

India voted in favour of the Canadian amendment, which was opposed by all the Arab nations, except Tunisia.

Indian ‘explanation’

In its ‘explanation of vote’ on the main resolution, India’s deputy permanent representative to the UN Yojna Patel noted that “casualties in the ongoing conflict in Gaza are a telling, serious and continuing concern. Civilians, especially women and children are paying with their lives,” but did not actually say why India had abstained. She said that India is “deeply concerned at the deteriorating security situation and astounding loss of civilian lives in the ongoing conflict” and that “escalation of hostilities in the region will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis” but confined her call to asking “all parties to display the utmost responsibility.”

Despite backing an amendment condemning Hamas by name, India’s representative chose not to name the organisation:

“The terror attacks in Israel on 7th October were shocking and deserve condemnation. Our thoughts are also with those taken hostages. We call for their immediate and unconditional release. Terrorism is a malignancy and knows no borders, nationality, or race. The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts. Let us keep aside differences, unite and adopt a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism.”

The emergency session was called under the “Uniting for Peace” mandate, allowing the 193-member General Assembly to take action when the UN Security Council is gridlocked due to the veto power exercised by its permanent members.

Mounting casualties, deadlock in Security Council

Over the past two weeks, the United States, China, and Russia have employed their veto authority to prevent the adoption of any resolution addressing the ongoing crisis in West Asia.

On October 18, the United States vetoed a draft resolution tabled by Brazil and the UAE in the Security Council, which called for a “humanitarian pause”. A Russian draft had already failed to get the requisite number of nine votes to be adopted.

A similar scenario unfolded a week later on Oct 25 when China and Russia vetoed a US-led draft resolution. Russia’s second attempt to secure the adoption of a resolution also fell short of the necessary votes.

The crisis in the West Asian region escalated when Hamas launched an incursion from Gaza into southern Israel, resulting in over 1200 casualties, including hundreds of civilians. Apart from capturing an unspecified number of Israeli soldiers, Hamas also abducted more than 220 Israeli and foreign nationals and took them back into Gaza – a violation of international humantarian law.

Since then, Israel has been conducting extensive airstrikes in Gaza, leading to 7,326 casualties (as of October 27), according to the Palestinian health ministry. Israel has also imposed a blockade on the supply of food, fuel, electricity, medical supplies and water, with only a limited amount of food and medical aid reaching Gaza through a small number of trucks allowed in via the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt.

India’s first response to the violence came in the form of a tweet by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who expressed “solidarity” with Israel on October 7. This was further reiterated by Modi in a phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.

More than a week later, he spoke with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas following the devastating explosion at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza. India took the opportunity to reiterate its traditional support for the Palestinian cause and the two-state solution.

More than 400 civilians were killed, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israel has denied bombing the hospital but the video evidence it proffered to back its claim that the deadly explosion at Al-Ahli was the result of a misfired Palestinian rocket has been debunked by digital forensics and technical analysis.

This week, Modi had a conversation with Jordan’s King Abdullah. It was the first time that India referred to the need for an “early solution” to the humanitarian and security situation. India is one of the largest developing countries that has not called for a “ceasefire” or any halt to hostilities in the volatile region.

Just before the vote, Jordan’s permanent representative to the UN Mahmoud Daifallah Hamoud described Canada’s amendment to the draft resolution that addressed a humanitarian situation, as an attempt to perpetrate “whitewashing” of Israel’s atrocities against the Palestinian people. He reminded the UNGA that they were “witnessing a ground invasion by Israel as we speak”.

Naming Hamas and Israel

Canadian permanent representative Bob Rae contended that naming Hamas would be “fair” and “factual”, asserting that the amendment “names what has to be named”.

Pakistan’s envoy Munir Akram pointed out that the Canadian amendment should also name Israel as well for the retaliatory airstrikes. “Israel needs to be named too, if you are to be fair and equitable and just,” he said. Akram said that it would be better not to name any sides in a resolution that was just calling attention to the humanitarian crisis.

The Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan said that the UN hold “not even one ounce of legitimacy”. “The only way to destroy Hamas is to root them out. Why are you not holding Hamas accountable,” he asked.

The Israeli envoy disputed statistics about casualties in Gaza, claiming that Hamas was propping up the numbers. “We know there is no humanitarian crisis in accordance with international humanitarian law,” he said.

While US President Joe Biden has also questioned the extent of civilian casualties in Gaza, the UN has vouched for the credibility of the death toll the Palestinian side has reported from Gaza in the past. On Thursday, the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza published the names and details of 6,747 Palestinians killed in Gaza since Israeli airstrikes started on October 7. The number of children killed was 2,655.

UNGA resolution condemned ‘terrorism and indiscriminate attacks’

Titled “Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations”, the UNGA resolution condemned “all acts of violence against Palestinian and Israeli civilians including all acts of terrorism and indiscriminate attacks” and that all parties “immediately and fully comply” with obligations under international humanitarian and human rights laws, “particularly in regard to the protection of civilians and civilian objects.”

It also urged the protection of humanitarian personnel, the wounded, and humanitarian facilities and assets, and to enable and facilitate humanitarian access for essential supplies and services to reach all civilians in need in the Gaza Strip.

Furthermore, the resolution called for rescinding of the order by Israel, “the occupying Power”, for Palestinian civilians, UN staff and humanitarian workers to evacuate all areas in the Gaza Strip north of Wadi Gaza and relocate to the south.

‘Release all civilians’

The General Assembly also called for the “immediate and unconditional release” of all civilians being illegally held captive, demanding their safety, well-being and humane treatment in compliance with international law.

It also reaffirmed that a “just and lasting solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved by peaceful means, based on the relevant UN resolutions and in accordance with international law, and on the basis of the two-state solution.

India, in its explanation of vote, also reiterated its support for a negotiated solution to the problem:

“India has always supported a negotiated Two-State solution to the Israel-Palestine issue leading to the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine living within secure and recognized borders, side-by-side in peace with Israel. For this, we urge the parties to de-escalate, eschew violence and work towards creating conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations.”

"With the Demolition of the National Museum, India Stands to Lose a Piece of its History",https://m.thewire.in/article/culture/with-the-demolition-of-the-national-museum-india-stands-to-lose-a-piece-of-its-history,"Oct 28, 2023  |  Ananya Vajpeyi","Ever since the Modi administration announced a plan for the redevelopment of the Central Vista in 2019, there has been growing public worry about the protection and preservation of the capital’s prime heritage zone along with its institutions, monuments, parks and roads. It appears that the Master Plan aims to “modernise” New Delhi by obliterating the aesthetic imprimatur of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

From its very inception, the Central Vista Redevelopment Plan (CVRP) has attracted criticisms and objections from art historians, urban planners, heritage experts, architects, conservationists, writers, artists, curators, activists, environmentalists, opposition leaders and concerned citizens. Thus far, these concerns have not been adequately addressed – neither in the media, nor in the courts, nor in the parliament.

Instead, over the past four years, despite legal challenges, public campaigns, and the Covid-19 pandemic, Rajpath has been renamed “Kartavya Path”; the India Gate lawns and the grounds alongside the ceremonial avenue leading from the India Gate to Vijay Chowk have been landscaped afresh; the Mughal Garden in the Rashtrapati Bhavan has been renamed “Amrit Udyan”; the Indira Gandhi National Center for the Arts (IGNCA) had its contents shifted to Janpath Hotel, after which its buildings on Dr. Rajendra Prasad Road were demolished; a new – triangular – Parliament building has been inaugurated; the existing – circular – Indian Parliament is set to be repurposed as a “Museum of Democracy”; the national emblem, instead of being a replica of the Sarnath Lion Capital, was remodelled to give it a ferocious look before setting it atop the new parliament building; Teen Murti Bhawan, formerly preserved as Nehru’s residence, was extended and named “Museum of Indian Prime Ministers”, and a statue of Subhash Chandra Bose (1897-1945) was installed in the previously empty canopy at India Gate.

New residences for the prime minister and vice president situated close to the Rashtrapati Bhawan, and a national biodiversity arboretum inside the Presidential Estate, are on the cards.

The Annexe Building of the National Archives of India, Nehru Bhawan that houses the Ministry of External Affairs, Vigyan Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan and as well as numerous other government offices will be taken down and relocated.

The next building slated for demolition is the National Museum on Janpath. Its contents are to be shifted up the Raisina Hill, to the North Block and the South Block, which will be refashioned into a space called “Yug Yugeen Bharat”, the world’s largest museum. Though not confirmed, word is that the Indian authorities have sought advice from the French government on how to retrofit these colonial-era office blocks into a state-of-the-art museum.

While the CVRP in its entirety poses a grave threat to the very character of post-colonial Delhi, scholars have been particularly exercised about the fate of the National Museum. Shockingly, close to 70 years after it opened in 1955, a complete inventory of its holdings is still not available in the public domain. Nor is there any clarity from the government about when the existing museum will be closed to visitors; where its priceless contents will be housed while the current building is demolished and before the new premises are ready; how long it will take for the North and South Block to be refurbished and repurposed; how and where researchers will have access to the museum’s artefacts during the transition, and what, if any steps will be taken to ensure that nothing is lost, stolen or damaged in the move.

The National Museum, like most of India’s central and state museums, is significantly understaffed. How a change of address will be managed without adequate personnel is anybody’s guess.

Equally worrisome is the prospective change in the narrative under which the new museum will organise its display. Since 2014, this dispensation has sought to hijack Indian history for the glorification of Hindutva through new school and college textbooks, culture warriors masquerading as experts, powerful propaganda machinery, and relentless popular messaging.

Whatever threatens the Hindu right wing’s communal agenda – whether so-called “external” or “foreign” elements emanating from Islam and Christianity, or political ideas associated with the inclusive secularism of Gandhi, Nehru and Tagore, or dissenting movements originating in non-Brahmin, Dalit and tribal traditions – anything, in short, that has defined and complicated Indian identity both within the domestic sphere and globally for the past century, is now increasingly being purged from public life.

Will the Indus valley civilisation, Mughal India, the national movement, or the making of the Indian constitution under Dr. Ambedkar’s leadership find a place in India’s past, as revised and reconstituted from a majoritarian perspective?

What assurance can the government give us that the material repository of our complex, diverse and fragile history will survive the arduous journey from Janpath to Raisina Hill, with its multi-religious and multi-cultural mosaic still intact?

If recent exhibitions and shows at other major venues in central Delhi, like the National Gallery of Modern Art at Jaipur House and the newly-inaugurated “Bharat Mandapam” at Pragati Maidan are any indication, the national museum of the Hindu Rashtra will probably look nothing like the national museum of the Republic of India.

Also read: Now, Godi Artists?

What steps are being taken to ensure that the new National Museum will be truly “national” – and not communal and exclusionary? How will all Indian citizens, regardless of their religion, caste, language, ethnicity, sexual preference or political affiliation find their story reflected in the polarised and partisan account likely to be constructed for Yug Yugeen Bharat?

The final and, in a sense, most difficult issue is that the very historicality of India – its journey through recorded time, and its emergence as a modern nation through actual events – is, under the current regime, sought to be muddied with terminology like “Yug Yugeen” and “Amrit Kaal” – conjuring up fuzzy notions of timelessness, eternity, immortality, and perfection.

The conflicts and struggles of real people in empirically verifiable contexts vanish under these vague fictions of an unchanging and unproblematic “Bharat”, which has no beginning and no end, whether temporal or spatial. If our government is going to resort to anachronistic and obfuscatory language, edit and erase troublesome facts, ignore whole communities and sideline entire cultures, no matter what their demographic dimensions; if it is going to project an imaginary “Amrit Kaal” nowhere in evidence while ignoring the devastating “Aapad Kaal” of the pandemic, how are we supposed to trust it to make the world’s best museum for the world’s largest democracy?

Also read: The Demolition of the National Museum Will Extinguish the Identity of an India That was Born in 1947

In May 2021, leading art historians and museum curators from within the country and overseas signed a plea to save India’s National Museum, National Archives and National Centre for the Arts from the depredations of the CVRP.

In October 2023, a public petition to save the National Museum began circulating once again, this time initiated by university students and young people interested in Indian history. Thousands of people have signed, both times. It is urgent that the authorities – in the ministries of housing and urban Affairs, as well as culture – take cognisance of the concerns of ordinary citizens. After all, the National Museum is about our shared history and whatever goes in it belongs equally to all of us. We have every right to know what it contains, why it is being demolished, when and under what conditions its contents will be safeguarded, and how our treasures will be managed and displayed in their new home. It is high time the government came forward with some answers.

A Coursemate Appeals: Bring Back Indian Navy Veterans on Death Row in Qatar Now,https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/coursemate-appeal-indian-navy-veterans-death-row-qatar,"Oct 27, 2023  |  Kaypius","In a sudden, shocking turn of events, eight former Indian Navy officials who were incarcerated in Qatar on unknown charges since August 30 last year were “sentenced to death” by a Qatari ‘Court of First Instance’. Families of the eight veterans who held on to a sliver of hope that back-channel efforts may secure their release now face the most extreme prospect — Death Row.

The naval veterans were working for a now-defunct company, Dahra Global Technologies, based out of Doha. Their area of expertise was training and assisting the Qatari Emiri Forces in setting up defence capacities – a vital cog in the wheel of Indo-Qatar bilateral defence cooperation and foreign policy. One of the wealthiest countries today, the tiny kingdom of Qatar has traditionally enjoyed warm and cordial relations with India. Today, an estimated diaspora of 800,000 Indians, along with other nationalities, contribute to building this country in various capacities, brick by brick, under the leadership of Emir Sheikh Tamim Hamad Al Thani.

The details of the present case are far too sketchy and opaque to justify such an extreme sentence in such a short trial. There have hardly been three hearings since the first one on March 22 this year. Since their incarceration in August 2022, the Indian government has provided the veterans with the “best” legal assistance. It is unlikely that substantive arguments from the (local) defence counsel would be heard and addressed in just three hearings over seven months.

The “death sentence” has left the Indian establishment “deeply shocked” as per a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) statement put out on October 26, soon after sentencing. The MEA statement indicates an ‘unexpected outcome’ while also hinting at the opacity of charges framed against the officials. Meanwhile, Qatar has acted in complete secrecy, moving from trial to conviction in seven months. Apparently, Indian authorities have been taken by complete surprise. Often, when expectations fall woefully short of outcome in such cases, one is left with nothing but tears. I know this from personal experience. I am sure the affected families, even strangers with a conscience, had a lump in their throats when this news broke yesterday.

This episode is personal at many levels. Two of the eight – Commander Sanjeev Gupta and Commander Amit Nagpal – are my coursemates, whom I have known personally for over four decades. It is a fauji truism that nobody – not even your spouse – knows you better than a coursemate.

Sanjeev (First Course of 10+2(X), “Oceans Best”), my namesake and one of the convicted, was known as ‘Chote’ or ‘Don’ in our course. His small frame hides an outsized heart and rock-solid patriotism while his ever-helpful nature earned him the latter epithet. Such is his obsession with propriety and fairness that on one of my earliest visits to his hometown Agra, he dragged my errant auto rickshaw driver all the way from the bus station to the local police station to register a complaint for charging ‘excess to meter’. His peers and subordinates will recount numerous anecdotes where his dildaar and can-do attitude saved the day.

Amit (78 NDA) or ‘Naggy’ as we call him in our circles, is a quintessential gentleman – a man of few words and impeccable character whom I first met when we ran into our NDA coursemates on ships of the training squadron at Kochi. A communication and electronic warfare specialist, he knows the value of “indiscretion” and “radio silence” better than most. Always professional, meticulous and “officer-like” to a fault, Naggy and I did the 61st staff course together at Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, 2005-06. I cannot begin to fathom the fate that befalls him and his family today.

I can sign a character certificate for these two officers with my eyes closed. So can a multitude of naval officials who have known or worked with these eight veterans, including sailor Ragesh. These are honest, above-board gentlemen who worked with the same zeal and commitment in Indian Navy service as in their selected fields post-retirement. I challenge those who know them personally to publicly reveal to me a single act of indiscretion that even remotely points to suspicions of the nature they have allegedly been charged with.

The managing director of their enterprise, Commodore Purnendu Tiwari (I do not know him personally), was felicitated with the Pravasi Bhartiya Samman Award by the President of India Ram Nath Kovind at a glittering ceremony in January 2019 for “enhancing India’s image abroad”. Commodore Tiwari is the first Indian armed forces veteran to be awarded this honour meant for NRIs/PIOs. How did these character certificates suddenly dissolve into a death sentence? What level of bungling led to this impasse? Whom are we seeking to protect? This is something the Indian government needs to come clean about. Not least because Qatar won’t.

There are, quite obviously, missing pieces to this puzzle, yet to be uncovered by investigative noses from India. But, I fear, under a climate of “ab tum chup raho” and nosediving indices of press freedom, facts may never come out, even if they lurk beneath the surface, or, worse still, point to the establishment. Meanwhile, Qatar has proceeded unapologetically, thumbing their noses at our soft-pedalling attitude (remember, our VP visited Qatar during the FIFA World Cup inaugural). The latest judgment can best be described as a resounding slap in the face of Indian diplomacy. Is it okay to be “deeply shocked” at such travesties when Vishwaguru is the image that is unabashedly being promoted by all arms of the government?

I fear this case may go the Kulbhushan Jadhav way (another very unfortunate case, the trail of which case seems to have gone cold) unless we move with alacrity. There are distinct differences, though I sincerely wish India had done more for Kulbhushan’s case. Dahra Global and its verticals were doing above-ground work in a crucial area of Indo-Qatar defence collaboration. This space would undoubtedly have international competitors with enormous clout, money and political patronage who would (undoubtedly) gain from the fall of Dahra Global and the scapegoating of these Indian Navy veterans. Perhaps it is time for the public, if not the government, to seek answers to the old police maxim: “Who benefits from the crime?”

The terrible turn of events couldn’t have come at a more inopportune moment for the convicted veterans and their families. Dahra Global Technologies in Qatar is no longer a going concern, which means the Indian Navy personnel are pretty much on their own. India’s nuanced position on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and support for the Palestinian cause will be put to the test against Qatar’s emerging role in working out a rapprochement between the Arab world and Israel, even as world leaders weigh their options. Our relationship with Qatar will head south if the ensuing diplomatic row after the latest imbroglio is not settled on mutually acceptable terms. India is in the grip of ICC Cricket World Cup fever, where absurd theatrics and sporting fervour can easily eclipse real-life problems. If all this is not bad enough, India is headed into a general election season where parties will politicise every available opportunity.

The downside of hypnotising billions with an image of a “world leader” or Vishwaguru is that sometimes problems crop up that demand the full agency of such leaders to step in and solve complicated problems. Now the unthinkable has happened – eight Indian Navy veterans are on death row in a friendly foreign country and the MEA under our strongman, S. Jaishankar, is “deeply shocked”. Whatever that means in diplomacy, this event has no precedence in modern India. The minions, influencers, Ambassadors and lawyers have done their bit, had their say. No more passing of the buck is possible. The issue is right here on the table of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruler of a wealthy Middle East kingdom that served us 14-month notice.

Bring Back our naval veterans on Death Row in Qatar NOW.

New Delhi: NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand on Thursday (October 26) voiced concerns about potentially missing the zero-hunger target by 2030, despite a significant growth in per capita food production.

He made these comments at an event while advocating for boosting agricultural productivity growth beyond 2% annually, so that we don’t have any issue meeting our domestic food demand as the population continues to rise, Mint reported.

He noted that over the past two decades, agricultural prices have risen by 26% more than other goods. This, combined with rising food prices and environmental concerns, places India’s agricultural productivity under scrutiny.

Despite rising per capita food production, malnutrition has risen, especially in the last eight years, according to Ramesh Chand, who attributed this phenomenon to the rising food prices.

He further voiced concerns about India potentially missing the zero-hunger target by 2030.

Notably, malnutrition in India is two to seven times higher than other BRICS member countries, according to a 2015 World Bank report. The same result was indicated in the 2021 report of Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.

Rising food prices have been cited as a significant factor behind increasing global hunger rates since 2015, especially in regions like Africa, Latin America, and South Asia, including India."
Recommendation for ‘India That Is Bharat’ To Be Turned To ‘Bharat’ Alone in Textbooks Does Not Fly,https://m.thewire.in/article/education/ncert-ci-issac-india-bharat,"Oct 27, 2023  |  Meetu Jain","New Delhi: The so-called renaming of India to ‘Bharat’ for National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) school textbooks was recommended by the focus group set up by the Trust for social sciences, one of 25 groups whose inputs went into the final “National Curriculum Framework”, a blueprint for school syllabi across India.

Kerala is the first state to have plainly rebuffed moves to change textbooks on a whim, especially on a major subject like the name of a country. The state’s education minister, V. Sivankutty, told the media on Thursday, “Citizens have the right to use India or Bharat as said in the constitution. That they are now saying only Bharat should be used as a country’s name is a narrow politics. Kerala cannot accept this.”

He termed it another move by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government to distort historical facts.

“Earlier, after NCERT had removed certain portions, we included them in the syllabus taught in the state through additional textbooks,” he said.

Education was a state subject before being put in the concurrent list, in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. But school education is still an area with considerable say of state governments.

Professor C.I. Issac, head of the sub-committee at NCERT whose recommendation that India be renamed Bharat has stirred up a controversy, while reacting to the fact that NCERT had not included his committee’s recommendations told The Wire, NCERT is nowadays led by “JNU products, who have preconceptions about everything”. He said, “You know the nature of the bureaucracy nowadays.”

Issac added, “The seven-member committee unanimously agreed on it. One member was from NCERT and he did not object either in any of the three or four meetings.”

He expressed surprise that the recommendations did not make their way into the final report. “Our recommendation was not added in the final copy and was submitted to the minister. It is the responsibility of the minister. It is not my responsibility. Minister never called us, never cross verified. Whatever was given, he signed it.”

Backdrop

Ever since the opposition group has been using the acronym INDIA, Modi personally and the BJP have been visibly unsettled and led a controversial campaign to minimise the use of the name of the country. An invitation from the President of India for a dinner during the G-20 introduced the Government of Bharat to the exclusion of India, attracting comments about the deep insecurity INDIA had bred in the ruling party.

Article 1 of the Constitution of India reads, “India, that is Bharat”, with both terms used interchangeably and effortlessly.

Modi had gone to the extent of struggling to rename NDA (adding the phrase ‘Development’, instead of Democratic). He also referred to proscribed groups, the Indian Mujahideen and PFI, trying to make a dubious case that all things with India in their name, weren’t in the interest of India.

“I am not RSS”

Issac has been a member of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

But he said, “I am not RSS, I am a church going Christian. Who told you I am RSS. I am non-Brahmin. Mine is a 500-year-old Christian family. I have noting to do with RSS. Please don’t bring in RSS. They do not decide these things.”

Issac says the change in name should be taught from Classes 7 to 12. “Up to Class 7, the local body school can decide what name they want to call India by. They can call whatever they want but from Class 7 onwards and up to Class 122, they have to call it Bharat,” he told The Wire over the phone from Sharjah.

“I am doing this in the public interest and the interest of the nation for our future generations. The name India was used for the first time in 1868 when the East India company administration was taken over by the Crown. But the name Bharat has been used for 7,000 years. Kalidasa used it, Tagore used it in the Jana Gana Mana. Till now there has been no controversy. Names keep changing. They changed the name of Bombay to Mumbai, Allahabad to Pragyaraj, only now controversy is starting. I am an academician and I have nothing to do with politics. It was because of my record at ICHR that I was appointed to this committee,” he said.

“Even my ancestors were Hindus. But they converted to Christianity 500 years ago. They had Hindu names but now I have Christian name,” he said.

Sharp criticism

The proposed change drew a flurry of protests across political parties on Thursday, with members of parliament’s standing committee on education saying they would take this up at the next meeting. CPI(M) Rajya Sabha MP Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said, “Such recommendations damage Indian unity. This name wasn’t given by the British, it’s a wrong perception and this has already been discussed in the Constituent Assembly. The name Bharat can at best be called a nick name. It arises from one creed, one feudal culture. The name India represents a modern democracy.”

An ex-member had raised the issue of changes being made to the NCERT curriculum en masse and had written to chairman Vivek Thakur and pointed out that history cannot be changed and attempts to do so through the back door must be scrutinised. The member had pointed out that this attempt to change history must stand the test of objectivity and deep scrutiny.

Next steps?

NCERT chief Dinesh Saklani was not available for a comment. Another committee member, Mamata Yadav, who teaches at a school in Haryana, said, “We have given a report as we were asked to give it. We cannot give a comment on what will happen next.”

The committee has consulted “a number of academicians”, Issac said, without specifying any names. “I don’t know what the controversy is. Look at my family. We converted to Christianity but retain our Hindu value system and Christian faith. I have a Hindu name along with my Christian name. It is Raju.”

But Issac pushed back at a mild question of considering ‘going back’ to his own name, Raju, “Why should I do that? In Hinduism we say, sarva deva namaskaram. All gods are equal. No difference between Hindu God and Christian God. That is why I am still retaining my Christian faith.”

The Hindustan Times quoted Karnataka’s deputy chief minister, D.K. Shivakumar, as saying, “Why are we saying the Reserve Bank of India, Indian Administrative Service and Indian Foreign Service? In our passports, we have the Republic of India… Why are they confusing the minds of Indians?… Whatever stand they have taken is completely anti-people, anti-India, and anti-Bharat… I am telling you they (NCERT) have been forced by the NDA government. This is completely wrong… You can’t change the history of India… Karnataka will continue with whatever there was earlier…”

Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that the proposal to replace ‘India’ with ‘Bharat’ in school textbooks is unacceptable and “a continuation of the recent arbitrary exclusion of portions including Mughal history and the banning of the RSS following Gandhi’s assassination” from the curriculum."
Qatar: 8 Former Indian Navy Officers Handed Death Penalty; MEA to Explore 'All Legal Options',https://m.thewire.in/article/world/qatar-eight-former-indian-navy-officers-handed-death-penalty,"Oct 26, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: The eight former Indian Navy officers who have been detained in Qatar for over a year were handed the death penalty on Thursday, October 26, with the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stating that it was “deeply shocked”.

The men were working for a private firm, Dahra Global Technologies and Consultancy Services, which provided training and related services to Qatar’s armed forces. They were detained without charges in August 2022, with media reports suggesting that they had been charged with espionage. Their bail pleas were rejected multiple times.

The verdict was passed on Thursday by the Court of First Instance of Qatar.

The eight men are Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma, Captain Saurabh Vasisht, Commodore Amit Nagpal, Commodore Purnendu Tiwari, Commodore Sugunakar Pakala, Commodore Sanjeev Gupta and Sailor Ragesh.

“We are deeply shocked by the verdict of death penalty and are awaiting the detailed judgement. We are in touch with the family members and the legal team, and we are exploring all legal options. We attach high importance to this case, and have been following it closely. We will continue to extend all consular and legal assistance. We will also take up the verdict with Qatari authorities,” the statement by the MEA read.

The ministry said that due to the confidential nature of the proceedings, “it would not be appropriate to make any further comment at this juncture”.

Sources pointed out that the last line in the statement was highly unusual, but was reflective of the general line of the government that it requires sensitive handling.

The opposition Congress party’s chief spokesperson, Jairam Ramesh, said that it learnt with the “greatest anguish” about the death sentence imparted to the eight former defence officers.

“The Indian National Congress has noted with the greatest anguish, distress and shock the most disturbing developments in Qatar regarding 8 former officers of the Indian Navy. It hopes and expects that the Govt of India will use its diplomatic and political leverage with the Qatar government to the maximum to ensure that the officers have full recourse to appeals and also do the utmost to get them released at the earliest,” he tweeted.

Information about the case against the eight men has been limited since its inception.

The opaque nature of the trial in Qatar is evident in the fact that none of the major media outlets within the Gulf kingdom reported the death sentence, even several hours after the Indian government’s announcement.

It came to light that these eight individuals were apprehended in August 2022, following the vocal concerns raised by their family members. They endured several months of solitary confinement before the commencement of their trial.

One of the detained persons, Purnendu Tiwari, was given the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman award by President Ramnath Kovind. The award, as tweeted by the Indian embassy in Doha, was “in recognition of his contribution towards capacity building for the Qatar Navy”. It also said that it was the first time that this award for Indian diaspora was given to a former armed force personnel.

Tiwari had been the managing director at Dahra Global Technologies and Consulting Services, a defence consultancy firm, whose Omani CEO was also detained, but later released.

All eight Indian men were reportedly contracted to provide training to the Qatar navy.

According to media reports, the former naval officers are accused of espionage on behalf of Israel related to Qatar’s submarine programme. Qatar had reportedly claimed to have electronic evidence pertaining to the allegations.

External affairs minister S. Jaishankar had first spoken about the case when he was asked about it in Rajya Sabha last year.

Stating that it was a “very sensitive matter,” Jaishankar had said that their interests were “foremost in our mind”.

“Our Ambassadors, senior officials, have been in continuous touch with the Qatari government on this. Our effort is obviously to ensure that they are not treated unfairly and that the sooner we can bring them back home. So, I assure you that they are very, very strong in our priorities in respect of Qatar, and it is something that we will be pursuing,” he had replied on December 7, 2022.

The first hearing of the trial at the Court of First instance took place on March 29 this year.

A week later, the opposition Congress party’s chief spokesperson had raised questions about New Delhi having “invested greatly” in improving relations with Qatar, but was unable to get relief for the detained Indian nationals.

Training guns on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his close proximity to a prominent Indian tycoon, Ramesh asked, “Is the Prime Minister reluctant to put pressure on Qatar because its sovereign wealth fund is a major investor in Adani Electricity Mumbai.”

There was no reply from the ruling party, but at the next MEA briefing, the spokesperson noted that the legal process had to be played out.

“If I were to extrapolate that, it would be as if a country has good relations with India, their nationals would not be subject to our laws. I don’t think that’s the line that we want to take. I think Indian laws are applicable to nationals of countries with whom we have good relations also. So, I don’t think good relations should come in the way of a legal process in that,” he said on April 7.

Two months later, Jaishankar gave a general press conference to mark nine years of the NDA government.

At the packed auditorium on June 8, the minister noted that the “full nature of the charges are not entirely clear to us.”

He also said that India was giving the “strongest possible support to the concerned people, including the legal representation, because we believe that their rights should be fully protected”.

Jaishankar also said that he did not rule out diplomacy, but did not give any details.

Iriqat said that the two million Palestinians who are citizens of Israel are second and third-class citizens.

She also talked about how Hamas is viewed by three categories of Palestinians – Palestinians who are citizens of Israel, Palestinians who live in the West Bank, and Palestinians who live in Gaza and how popular it is in Gaza today.

Asked if a free, fair and credible election were to be held in Gaza today, the way it had happened in 2006, would Hamas win a victory, Iriqat categorically said no. In fact, she clearly suggested that a free and fair election is perhaps the best way of diminishing and reducing Hamas. But the Israelis, she says, will not allow a free and fair election.

This is a transcript of Iriqat’s interview. It has been edited lightly for clarity and style.

§

Karan Thapar: Hello and welcome to a special interview for The Wire. On the 17th day of the Israel-Hamas conflict, we ask what it is like to be a Palestinian in Israel. Joining me now from Ramallah to answer that question is a professor at the Arab American University of Palestine, Dalal Iriqat.

Dr Iriqat, I want to talk to you about what it’s like to be Palestinian in Israel. I’m told Palestinians in Israel fall into three broad categories: citizens of Israel, those who live in the West Bank where Israel is effectively a colonising power, and those who live in Gaza blockaded and besieged by Israel.

Let’s start with Palestinians, who are citizens of Israel. I’m told there are some two million of them. Do they have equal rights with Jews or are they second-class citizens?

Dalal Iriqat: Well, thank you very much. Those two million Palestinians who live in Israel hold Israeli citizenship, but it was documented that they don’t enjoy equal rights as any other Israeli “Jewish citizen”.

In Israel, they had passed in the Knesset, which is the parliament of the Israeli people, what is called the Jewish Nation State Law in 2018.

The Jewish Nation State Law stipulated very bluntly that those who enjoy full rights in Israel are the Jewish citizens of Israel alone, not only depriving two million Palestinians – and those are of course Muslims and Christians and atheists, if you want – of the basic rights, but also all the other minorities who might be living in Israel.

If you are not a Jewish citizen of Israel, you are a second or third-class citizen. This of course applies to the Palestinians who live there. So the Palestinians–yeah, go on.

KT: Sorry, I was just going to say, this is why the term ‘apartheid state’ is used for Israel. Is that right?

DI: Yes, and let’s be clear here, apartheid is not only a term, it’s not only a label or it’s not an invention that the Palestinians came up with. Apartheid, under international law, by definition is a sort of crime.

And it’s important to also clarify to your audience and to Indians in general that it was international human rights organisations which conducted research and which approved and documented the crimes of apartheid against the Palestinians who are not only in the West Bank, but also the Palestinians who live inside Israel.

It is a documented crime, and international human rights organisations and Israeli human rights organisations also documented the crime. This is a very important message to convey to your audiences that Israel is committing the crime of apartheid under the framework of the Israeli military prolonged occupation for 75 years now.

KT: Now, I believe Israel has what’s called a ‘law of return’, which allows Jews from anywhere in the world to come to Israel and get automatic citizenship.

But family members of Palestinians who were born in Palestine but left either at the time of the Nakba or the 1967 War are denied this right. Am I correct in that?

DI: You are very correct on that, although the Palestinian refugees have a right in UN resolution 194 – it’s a Security Council resolution – for the right of return. However, in practice, Israel does not allow any return of any Palestinian refugees.

On the contrary and on the other hand, they of course permit and allow and they intensify the return of the Jewish people from all around the world to the state of Israel.

This is the way, this is the strategy that they have been implementing to increase the demography of the Jewish people on this land at the expense of the Palestinian existence as a nation, as a population.

KT: So the law of return in Israel directly breaches the resolution 194 of the UN. It is a direct defiance of it.

DI: Yes, and there is no other interpretation for that. All the UN and the international community understands very well that there is an embedded right for the Palestinians in 194 and there is a blunt violation [of] it by the Israeli military regime.

KT: Now in recent months, there have been serious protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu’s attempts to dilute the power of the Supreme Court.

But I’m told that whenever laws that discriminate against Palestinians are challenged in the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court upholds those laws and doesn’t strike them down. So are Palestinians also second-class citizens in the eyes of Israel’s judiciary?

DI: Well, of course. The fact that Israel has been treating the Palestinians with “military orders” – you know, the judicial system [when] it comes to Israeli Jewish citizens is laws, but when it comes to the Palestinians, it comes by military orders. This mere fact is evidence that yes, the Palestinians are second-class citizens.

But talking about Netanyahu, Netanyahu has been here for six terms of government. He had been manipulating his own people, he had been, you know, winning midterm victories in his tactics with Hamas or with Gaza at the expense of finding a peaceful solution for the Palestinians and the Israelis alike.

The protests that we had witnessed in Israel are a very a nice reflection of democracy in Israel. However, I had wished and I had hoped that those people in Israel who were demonstrating against Netanyahu’s “judiciary reform”, that they would raise a sign calling for the end of the occupation, that they would raise a sign calling for humanity for the Palestinians – not only the 2.2 million Palestinian civilians who live in Gaza, but also the three million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and the two million Palestinians who live inside Israel.

Discrimination, apartheid and racism have been documented and have been practised for 75 years. I really had hoped for the Israeli enlightened pro-peace camps, those who call themselves, you know, leftists, to call upon their own governments to stop the genocide and the collective punishments and the occupation and the military orders against the Palestinian civilians.

KT: You’re making two very important points there, Dr Iriqat. First, you’re saying that the people who came out in hundreds of thousands to protest against Netanyahu’s judicial reforms were certainly protesting in support of democracy, but only democracy for Jews in Israel. They didn’t extend their protest to cover even the two million Palestinian citizens of Israel.

And, secondly, you’re saying this belief that the world has that the Supreme Court in Israel checks the abuses of democracy may be true to the extent it supports Jewish rights, but it is not true to the extent to which it does not support Palestinian rights. This Supreme Court has validated anti-Palestinian laws passed by the state. It hasn’t struck them down.

Those are two very important points you’re making both about the Israeli people and about the Israeli Supreme Court.

DI: It’s exactly how you framed it; it’s exactly how you framed it. Israel is democratic when it comes to its tailored democracy, when it comes to serving the interest of the Jewish citizens of Israel alone.

But when it comes to seeing other people as human beings, it fails. When it comes to treating its own citizens as equal citizens. it fails. When it comes to addressing what its own state has been practising against another nation – you know, we are witnessing a second Nakba: forced eviction orders, you know, forces displacements, collective punishments, genocide.

Unfortunately, what the Jewish people had suffered in the Holocaust is being repeated by themselves on the Palestinians today. This is the sad reality that we should be learning from history, we should be, you know, safeguarding and protecting humanity. We should be, you know, prevailing justice and humanity over all those violence and crimes.

Unfortunately, the Israeli public is not saying what should be said to their own leadership.

KT: That’s a very important point you made which I’ll repeat for the audience before I go to my next question. What the Jews suffered during the Holocaust is exactly what Israel is doing today to the Palestinians and that is not just a paradox, it’s an irony that the Jews are doing to others what happened to them without realising it.

My last question about the Palestinians who are citizens of Israel, before I come to other categories of Palestinians: what sort of political involvement beyond voting is permitted to the Palestinian citizens of Israel?

Watch | Gaza Crisis to Last Months, Get Lot Worse Before it Calms: Former Palestine Minister

DI: Well, you know, the situation for the Palestinian citizens of Israel is really dire and it’s really… the framing is second or third-class citizens. They can vote, they can run for elections; however, it has been documented that the Israeli authorities made sure to maintain and to accelerate the levels of crimes between the Palestinian communities inside Israel.

The levels of drugs, for example… so they are trying to convert and to transform the Palestinian communities into really, a bad image of communities which don’t deserve equal rights. Unfortunately, this has been happening systematically against the Palestinian communities inside Israel.

The Palestinians, on the other hand, are mostly educated and most of them go into medicine and nursing and really the most scientific fields. So they are still needed when it comes to hospitals and medical service, yet they are not enjoying political rights as equal citizens of Israel when it comes to the Jewish people.

Before we finish, I also want to mention the settler terror because we were speaking about the Holocaust comparison. Last January and February, we have witnessed the settler terror all over the West Bank, in Huwara… It was called by the Israelis themselves [as a] pogrom, it was really a repetitive scenario of what the Israeli Jewish people have suffered under the Holocaust.

KT: Absolutely, now that we’ve begun talking about Israeli settlers, let’s come to the Palestinians who live in the West Bank, where many view Israel as a colonising power.

These people, these Palestinians in the West Bank, are not citizens of Israel. So first, let me start, what sort of rights do they have under Israeli occupation and control of the West Bank?

DI: The Palestinians, you mean?

KT: That’s right.

DI: Well, 30 years ago we had witnessed the opening of what was called the Middle East peace process. And the PLO [Palestinian Liberation Organisation] had signed an interim agreement, a declaration of principles with the government of Israel.

We are supposed to have an interim government of ruling. However, the reality is that those agreements have entrenched the Israeli occupation in every Palestinian city, village, and council The reality is that yes, we do have certain councils that do the public administration or the civil administration on a daily basis; for example, they do the [civil registry], those who are born, those who die.

But when it comes to real rights, when it comes, for example, to our rights to education, mobility, worship, even going to the al-Aqsa mosque, the churches in Bethlehem or Jerusalem, we still need a permit from the Israeli military authorities.

So in fact, in reality, on the ground, the Israeli occupation had been entrenched under the cover of a peace process, under the cover of the sugar-coated negotiations. On the ground, for the past 30 years, the number of settlers have more than tripled. Today we have more than 750,000 settlers living in settlements, you know, dividing the West Bank. There is no territorial contiguity between any Palestinian city.

So when they advocate for the two-state solution, geopolitically speaking, and you know, on the ground, it is not possible.

You know, I’m a professor of diplomacy and I am a very big fan of bringing about the two-state solution for a strategic solution for the Palestinian and the Israeli people alike.

However, if we are realistic and if we take a realpolitik approach on the ground, the Israeli settlements are basically, you know, the reason behind putting the Palestinians in small ghettos, divided and surrounded by those settlements which basically hinder any possibility of any two-state solution.

KT: Absolutely, for an Indian audience I just clarify that the West Bank is supposed to be – under the 1967 agreements – a Palestinian state, but because Israeli settlers, 750,000, have settled in the West Bank creating little pockets and islands, it is impossible now for the West Bank to actually ever take the shape of a separate autonomous country.

This has been a deliberate Israeli policy to ensure that the West Bank can never become a Palestinian state.

Let me then ask you what is the relationship between these 750,000 settlers and the Palestinian people. What sort of relationship do they have?

DI: They are weaponised, they are militarised, they practise terror on the Palestinians. They are treated as first-class citizens in comparison with the Palestinians. Unfortunately, the Palestinian citizens are suffering from the attacks and from the violence and terrorism that those settlers are practising against the Palestinian civilians and guess what? They are protected by the Israeli military army. Military soldiers.

I also want to clarify to the Indian audience that they need to understand that 30 years ago, the Palestinians had made a big concession, because we believe in peace, because we believe in the rights of the peoples of Israel to live in peace and security. We agreed to the two-state solution on the ‘67 border line.

This means that we gave up on 78% of historic Palestine. We accepted – as the PLO, which is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people – we accepted to have our own state on 22% of Mandated Palestine.

The two-state solution was the position of the international community. It was the concession that the PLO gave in our will and hopes for bringing peace, prosperity and security to the Palestinians as well as the Israelis.

What did we gain after 30 years of procrastinated so-called peace talks? More settlers, more settlements, no possibility on the ground of any independence of sovereignty for the Palestinian people. More extrajudicial killings on a daily basis, more detentions – you know that 5,200 Palestinians are still [behind] Israeli bars, you know, inside the Israeli prisons, suffering from every kind of racism and punishment.

There are 1,264 who are administratively detained, and I want to, you know, explain this to the Indian audience because I’m sure they haven’t heard about administrative detention before.

Administrative detention only exists in Israel. This is a very illegal way of detaining and arresting people, where they can basically renew the arrest every six months without putting them to court, without putting them to trial, without giving them the chance to see a lawyer.

Can you imagine, you know, 140 of those are women and 170 of those are children. Where on Earth in 2023 can you imagine that a state, a state that has the recognition of the world order, you know, abuses the rights of civilians, practises apartheid, practices every kind of racism, administrative detention, arrests on daily basis, confiscations of lands [and] extrajudicial killings?

We face on a daily basis, incursions, raids, killings, violence, settler terror. Everything is documented today and the world is an open world of communication. It’s sad that we are still telling our story under the Israeli occupation.

The root cause of what we are witnessing for the Palestinians and the Israelis alike, if we are calling for peace, we need to start by ending the Israeli military occupation.

KT: Absolutely. And as you said – I’m just, again, highlighting this for an Indian audience – even your hope of being able to form an independent, sovereign Palestine state on just 22% has been quashed by the settlers and the fact that you can’t do so [sic].

And it also means that because of continuing Israeli control on what is accepted internationally as your land, you’re even there second-class citizens.

Now I notice, since October 7th, I’m quoting Al Jazeera, “over 91 Palestinian people in the West Bank have been killed in clashes with settlers.”

This is since the 7th of October. Are these clashes a recent development or have they been happening regularly?

DI: The Israelis tried to mislead audiences that this whole thing started on the 7th of October. Let’s truly explain the reality and convey the reality and the right narration, because people in India deserve to learn the truth: that Israel had been manipulating, had been executing, had been practising apartheid and occupation against the Palestinian people for 75 years.

The crimes, under international law, under humanitarian international law, it’s all… we don’t need to really interpret things or to be clever about it. Doesn’t really take a genius to discover that the Israeli military occupation had been, you know, targeting every Palestinian, have been extrajudicially killing the Palestinians, have been targeting our lands, confiscating them for the for the interest of building more settlements.

The settler colonial project has been ongoing for so long. The Israeli state is built on the doctrine of settler colonialism that we have been suffering from for a long, long time.

Also Read: Gaza, Apartheid Israel and the Last Stand of Settler Colonialism

The message that the world needs to hear is that those states who have recognised the state of Israel for 75 years today need to realise that Israel doesn’t have a border line until today. Why? Why don’t we start by asking Israel to define its borderline?

When they say they want peace, when they say … that the Palestinians deserve peace, I want to tell the Indian people that no Israeli leader has ever uttered the word ‘state for the Palestinians’ or the ‘right of self-determination for the Palestinian people’.

On the contrary, they have been ongoing with their settler colonial project, with their terrorism against the Palestinians, more killings, more detentions, and more treating us as minorities who are only entitled to very minimal religious rights, in the case that we are not even allowed to go to Bethlehem or Jerusalem to even pray.

What the Israelis have been trying is to mislead audiences and unfortunately the hasbara, the Israeli propaganda, the investments they put in their narratives had to a certain extent succeeded in misleading audiences so far.

KT: Now the third category of Palestinian people are in Gaza. They live under a Hamas government, but they’re blockaded and besieged on three sides by Israel and on one by Egypt.

What sort of authority and control has Israel exercised over their lives since 2005 when it withdrew its government and withdrew its settlers from Gaza?

DI: Thank you. Let’s also be honest with the audience.

Gaza for the past 16 years has been suffering from a deadly siege, a deadly blockade imposed by the Israeli occupation. Yes, Israel conveyed to the world that they withdrew from Gaza in 2005. In reality, and I have publications on that and it’s all documented, that the Israelis disengaged, they dismantled the settlements inside Gaza; they never really withdrew control over Gaza.

For 16 years, the air space and sea of Gaza has been totally controlled by the Israeli occupation. Nothing could go inside or outside of Gaza but with Israeli permission.

So the fact that they are framing what is happening as an Israeli-Hamas war, and this is against Hamas in Gaza, this is totally not true.

For the past 16 years and let alone before – the Israeli occupation of 75 years – you know, Hamas just got created in 1987. Before 1987, there was also the Israeli occupation in Gaza. So, the narration that they withdrew in 2005, that Hamas is controlling Gaza, is totally not true.

And I want to quote Dov Weisglass, who was the aide and one of the supervisors for [Ariel] Sharon at that time: he said that this dismantling and this disengagement is basically formaldehyde, that was a strategy for divide and rule.

They made sure to make Hamas seem empowered inside Gaza while [Gaza was] being totally controlled by the Israeli occupation on all kinds of borders. Yet they misled the world that Hamas is controlling there and they made sure that there is no hope for one Palestinian state.

They made sure to divide the Palestinian national interest by dividing us into Gaza and the West Bank, Hamas and Fatah. And that is a sad story for us as Palestinians.

KT: So, in a nutshell, what you’re saying, Dr Iriqat, is although life for people in Gaza has deteriorated horribly since the 7th of October because they are now bombed practically every day with air strikes and there’s a threat of a ground invasion.

But actually what you’re saying is life for people in Gaza has been pretty miserable for 16-17 years; even though the Israelis claim they have withdrawn, they’ve encircled it and blockaded it, they prevented things coming in [and] going out, and the Gazans have been suffering for a very long time – that’s the point you’re making?

DI: Yes, for the past 15 years, the Gaza people, 2.2 million civilians, suffered four wars, four incursions, four attacks on the civilians of Gaza. Those people – and this is the fifth war, which started on October 7 – the people in Gaza were totally deprived from the basic minimum human rights.

You should know that people in Gaza don’t even enjoy the services of 2G when it comes to the internet. You know, this is a human need in the 21st century; let alone electricity, let alone water, let alone mobility rights, education rights.

People, two million civilians, were left with no hope, no reason to live. They really suffocated the people – thousands, thousands of young, smart, intelligent youth chose to go in the sea, seek refuge and you know prefer to die in the sea rather than to live under the Israeli military blockade, inside a big open air prison of 365 kilometres, deprived from the basic human needs in the 21st century.

KT: You’ve said something that will shake people: people in Gaza don’t even have 2G. And I’m told people in Gaza for years, if not decades, have been used to six and eight-hour power cuts regularly. They’ve been used to shortage of water regularly.

That has been the condition in which they’ve lived long, long before October 7.

Also Read: Unpacking the Hindutva Embrace of Israel

DI: Yes. Yes, and this is what people need to realise. Those people were [put in] a pressure cooker.

You deprive them from… can you imagine living without the internet for one hour today? Here I am addressing young people and old people, and everybody, you know, we cannot live without smartphones, without communicating with the world.

Can you imagine that in 2023, for 16 years, people are hearing about us communicating, about… and here we need to maybe clarify that people in the West Bank also enjoy only 3G services.

And this is all under an Israeli decision of depriving the Palestinians of this minimal human need. This is not, it’s not okay to tolerate that Israel is practising all those kinds of racism, crimes against humanity, against the Palestinians, and the people are watching and are keeping silent.

KT: Dr Iriqat, let’s now talk a little about Hamas.

How is Hamas viewed by Fatah, and the Palestinian authority government in Ramallah? How do they view Hamas?

DI: Well, it’s their competitor. I mean, they don’t agree with Hamas doctrine, they don’t agree with the strategy and with the approach that Hamas took for liberation and for resistance.

The PLO, which is the official leadership for the Palestinian people, had said and had demonstrated so many times that they are for peace talks, that they are for dialogue, that they are for negotiations. They promised the people of Palestine that they will get us dignity, freedom, independence and state through the peace talks and through negotiations.

What did they get us after 30 years of this sugar-coated peace process? More deterioration on the ground. Every Palestinian family has a family member behind Israeli bars. Every Palestinian family has a martyr, every Palestinian family has suffered from settler attacks or having their homes demolished, for example.

Many Palestinian young people had opportunities to go and study, they got scholarships, but they were not allowed to leave the country because the Israelis decided not to give them permits to leave the borders.

Everything in our daily lives, the aspects of our human reason to live, is basically controlled by the Israeli military occupation.

Watch | Everything You Need to Know About Hamas

KT: Are you also saying…

DI: I cannot plan a weekend for my kids, I cannot go visit my mother in Jericho, who is 30 minutes away, without crossing two checkpoints. My kids have to see the Israeli soldiers pointing the guns at the car at least twice, if we want to go and visit their grandmother on the weekend. This is not okay. Those…

KT: Are you also saying, Dr Iriqat, are you also saying that the people of the West Bank feel let down by the Palestine Authority?

DI: Let me put it this way. There is a lack of trust, yes, between the Palestinian people and the PNA [Palestine Authority].

But again, because the PNA and the PLO had promised us independence, state, sovereignty and dignity to say the least, yet we did not get anything.

So, I think the Israelis and the international community had led and had you know trapped the PLO and the PNA into this point where the PLO and the Palestinian leadership had lost the trust of their own people.

KT: Let’s come back for a moment to Hamas.

Do you have any sense of how popular Hamas is in Gaza today? We are often told by international statesmen that Hamas doesn’t represent all the people of Gaza. But what percentage of Gazans support Hamas?

DI: Okay. Well, Gaza is about 2.2 million civilians. Those people want to live in dignity and peace. Those people, the 2 million people, half of them are children! Half of them are children, so they don’t know what Hamas is. They don’t know what, you know, even the right of resistance is.

This is what needs to be made very clear to your audiences in India. 1.1 million of that population are children who don’t understand politics. So this messaging is very misleading when we say that there is, you know, encouragement or that people are fans of Hamas. This is totally untrue.

People want to live with dignity. As I just told you, we have documented data for tens of thousands of youths who chose to escape in the sea and die, and, you know, drown in the sea, trying to search for a dignified life. We don’t want violence; we want to live as normal human beings in 2023.

Parents want to provide milk, water, food and you know, a living for their families to have a nice and safe home and roof for their own kids…

KT: I understand.

DI: …Good education, a good healthcare system, this is what the people of Gaza deserve and that is what they want.

KT: Let me ask you one more question about Hamas. How is Hamas viewed by the Palestinian people who live in the West Bank, as well as the Palestinian people who are citizens of Israel?

I would guess that the Jews and the Palestinian people who live as citizens of Israel are both sometimes living in fear of Hamas rockets.

DI: Let’s… yeah… What you’re saying can be – yes, of course – true because they live there, and we have seen incidents where Palestinians and Arabs suffered from injuries or death from the rockets.

But also, I want to mention the Palestinian right to resistance. The Palestinian right to resistance – as any other nation under occupation, we have the right to struggle for our freedom. And resistance has many different ways. I resist through education, through my writings, through lecturing, through teaching in the university and through my publications.

Other people you know resist through art, through music, through acting, through journalism, through academia, through literature, yet armed resistance is one example of the right of resistance that people under occupation can enjoy if we are faced with … under fire [from] the Israeli military occupation.

You know that Israel is the fifth-most powerful country when it comes to military might. You know that they get $3.8 billion of military aid from the United States alone. They have the iron dome, they have shelters, they have been bombing and shelling [the Palestinian people] with missiles for 75 years.

People in Gaza have been suffering … As I said, five wars in 15 years, and where you see your children, your friends, your homes, the hospitals, the mosque: everything has been targeted. So the fact that the Palestinians are calling for their own freedom should be also comprehensible to citizens of the world.

KT: Can I ask like this, if another free, fair, credible election for the Palestinians was to be held – like happened in 2006, when Hamas beat Fatah to everyone’s surprise – if such a free, fair election were to be held – in the West Bank where Palestinians live and in Gaza – would Hamas once again win, or do you think that’s no longer the case?

DI: Absolutely not, absolutely not. As I said, we are living in 2023. Palestinians are humans. We want to live in dignity, we realise that we are going to live once. We want to have families, we want to have proper careers, we want to enjoy basic universal human standards of living.

Of course not, Hamas gained victory over Fatah not because people believed in Hamas per se, but because they were deceived by what the PNA had promised them and could not deliver.

And here I don’t blame it only on the PNA, but also on the international community and Israel, who made sure to weaken Fatah and to weaken the PNA in the eyes of the Palestinian people.

You cannot continue to promise people things while they are on the ground suffering on a daily basis and everybody’s watching the Israeli crimes against our people without acting.

KT: Can I interrupt and suggest something? What you’re saying sounds as if the best way of diminishing the influence of Hamas is to let the Palestinian people have a free, fair, full election. They will themselves vote Hamas out, that’s what you’re suggesting, am I right?

DI: Of course, of course, we deserve to have elections. And I realise that this is an internal setback for the past 15 years that we didn’t have proper elections. Yet – yet, we also need to realise that the international community and Israel is implicated in the fact of this divide and rule reality that we are facing.

They have hindered any possibility of elections for the Palestinian people, they are very happy with the status quo. It is serving their own interest.

KT: And the refusal and the denial of free, fair elections by Israel ensures that Hamas continues to be in power in Gaza. An election might have removed them. Failure to hold an election has entrenched them. It’s worked to the opposite of Israel’s [inaudible].

DI: Yes, Netanyahu has said in different announcements, in different declarations that he made, that he is keen about empowering Hamas in Gaza.

And the Indian population needs to hear that the cash money which used to go into Gaza used to go through Ben Gurion airport.

Why? Because Israel knows… the Israeli military commanders realised a while back that in order to hinder any possibility for the two-state solution, for any democracy for the Palestinian people and for the Palestinian national interest, they need to maintain the divide between Gaza and the West Bank.

KT: But you’re also confirming something, Dr. Iriqat, which Reuters reported I think yesterday or day before – that the money that Qatar gives Gaza is rooted through Israel. You’re now confirming it, aren’t you, when you say it comes through Israel?

DI: The Israelis confirmed it. Netanyahu himself confirmed it in so many announcements. They confirmed it. Actually, many Israeli citizens now blame it on Netanyahu, because they realised that he had been allowing the cash money into Gaza. They said it to him.

KT: My last question Dr Iriqat: both King Abdullah of Jordan and president [el-Sisi] of Egypt have emphatically said they will not accept any attempt by Israel to drive the Palestinian people into either Jordan or Egypt.

My question is a little different: Given the life Palestinians are forced to live in Israel or in the West Bank or in Gaza, would the Palestinian people themselves welcome the prospect of going to Jordan and Egypt?

DI: The Palestinian people have suffered from the Nakba in 1948 and then the Naksa in 1967, so I think we have learned the lesson very, very well. And the fact that the Palestinian refugees are still deprived of their basic right of return, I think the population of the Palestinian people will not leave and will not accept the forced displacement orders.

However, it is time that audiences realise that Israel has been systematically colonising and this settler colonial project has been ongoing. This [war of late] is being framed as an Israel-Hamas war because this is a logical argument that they could convince audiences with.

In reality they are using this pretext, they are using Hamas as a fig leaf, but their target is Gaza, is the land, is to evict the Palestinian people, is to continue to annex the land as part of their settler colonial project which will continue also in the West Bank. They are hoping that the Palestinian people will be evicted.

That’s why the Jordanian and the Egyptian position, which might sound a little bit inhumane in face of the sufferings of the millions of civilians, but on the political level we need to realise that they are saving the Palestinian national project, which is part of the deal of the century.

That’s why we see the USA, the shuttle diplomacy from Blinken and Biden providing this legal coverage for the Israeli war crimes against the Palestinian people, it is basically to serve their interests in their electoral campaigns coming soon, and for the right-wing leaders, of course, in Europe as well.

But also, because this is a pragmatic scenario of a win-win, a cake sharing scenario for the Israel, the US and many other regional players at the expense of the Palestinian national rights, at the expense of the Palestinian right to self-determination, at the expense of the lives of two million civilians living in Gaza.

KT: Permit me one last question before I let you go. I know in the middle of this interview you said you passionately support the concept of a two-state solution. But is it still feasible and practical with 750,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and with Israel having declared the whole of Jerusalem as its capital?

Is a two-state solution still possible or would you agree with someone like Gideon Levy, the Haaretz correspondent, who said to me in an interview on Saturday that a one-state solution with equal rights for Jews and Arabs, with equal rights for Israelis and Palestinians, is the most sensible solution?

And he said Israelis may not accept it today because it’s emotionally difficult. Palestinians may not accept it because it’s emotionally difficult, but that has to be the solution.

Would you agree with him or would you say no, this is too idealistic?

DI: No, he’s very realistic, because if you live here, if you commute north to south here, you will see, realistically and logically speaking, if you take the reasoning of reality, it is not possible anymore to have a Palestinian state, given all the settlements, the divisions, and given all the military system, that is the occupation system, that is entrenched, that is hindering any possibility for the Palestinian state.

Let alone Netanyahu and his leaders and his government’s statements of saying no to Palestinian state. The fact that they are saying no to a Palestinian state, no to peace talks, no to negotiations, make us have – it’s a wishful scenario of having a one-state reality.

Why would I say no to a one state reality, if I want to honour civilians, if I want to honour humanity, if I want to end the sufferings of the millions of Palestinian people under the Israeli military occupation?

Yes, under equal rights, we don’t want an apartheid state. The fact that Israel is trying to export what is happening here as a religious issue has led to the fact that the Israelis will not accept a one-state [solution].

Because this is not a Jewish-Muslim or a Jewish-Muslim-Christian conflict. No, it is a conflict over land. It is a settler colonial project. We don’t have a problem with the Jews.

You know, I have many Jewish friends all around the world, I studied with many of them, I have colleagues, many of them, and I keep good, positive and healthy relationships with many of them. Those who are enlightened, those who are in education, those who believe in me as an equal citizen. This is the message that we need to realise.

If Dalal Iriqat in Palestine, and Shlomo in Tel Aviv or Herzliya, or Ahmed in Pakistan or in India or in New York or in Paris or in Shanghai or in Greenland, are seen as equal human beings, then we will not look at the shape of the solution but we will look for humanity and for justice for every civilian – whether it is Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist or atheist.

This is the message that we need to hear – the Palestinians are not being treated or viewed by the Western media as equal citizens who are entitled to equal universal human rights.

KT: Dr Iriqat, thank you very much for the time you have given me and thank you very much for explaining in detail what it is like to be Palestinian in Israel. Take care, stay safe.

DI: Thank you very much."
Why Did Kotak Mahindra Bank Ignore Internal Talent and Choose a CEO With Negligible Indian Experience?,https://m.thewire.in/article/banking/why-did-kotak-mahindra-bank-ignore-internal-talent-and-choose-a-ceo-with-negligible-indian-experience,"Oct 26, 2023  |  Hemindra Hazari","On October 21, Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) announced that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has approved the appointment of Ashok Vaswani as the bank’s next managing director and chief executive officer.

He has been appointed as MD and CEO for a period of three years. He will join on January 1, 2024.

Vaswani’s selection was unexpected, as the media had reported the shortlisting of two internal candidates for RBI’s approval. They were K.P.S. Manian, head of corporate, institutional and investment banking and Shanti Ekambaram, head of consumer banking.

Prakash Apte, chairman of KMB, said, “We are pleased to announce that [the] RBI has approved the appointment of Ashok Vaswani as the next MD and CEO of KMB. Ashok is a global banking leader with a proven track record of building and growing businesses at an international scale and has successfully steered organisations to greater heights. We are confident that Ashok will accelerate change and drive growth at Kotak.”

Uday Kotak, founder and director, KMB, said, “I am delighted that the RBI has approved our recommendation, Ashok Vaswani, as the next CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank. Ashok is a world class leader and banker with digital and customer focus. I am proud that we bring a ‘Global Indian’ home to build Kotak and India of tomorrow.”

Ignoring internal talent

Typically, successful organisations take pride in grooming CEOs from within. The board’s Nomination and Remuneration Committee is responsible for nurturing internal talent for leadership succession, especially for strategic posts such as the post of the CEO.

When Aditya Puri retired from HDFC Bank, Sashi Jagdishan (then 56 years of age), a senior HDFC Bank executive, succeeded him. In ICICI Bank, after Chanda Kochhar was sacked by the board, Sandeep Bakshi (then 58 years), a long-serving ICICI Bank senior executive, was appointed.

In contrast, in the case of banks in which outside candidates replaced the CEOs, it was either because the banks were facing some serious issues and internal candidates were regarded as being part of the problem, or because the RBI lacked confidence in the internal candidates recommended by the board. Such were the cases in Axis Bank, when Amitabh Chaudhry (then 55 years) took charge from Shikha Sharma; in Yes Bank, when Ravneet Gill (then 56 years) replaced Rana Kapoor; and in RBL Bank, when R. Subramaniakumar (then 63 years) replaced Vishwavir Ahuja.

In KMB’s case, the members of Uday Kotak’s leadership coterie were all employees who had been associated with the bank/group for a long period. It was, therefore, highly unusual for the board of directors to have ignored internal talent and recommended two individuals for the CEO position to the RBI, at least one of whom was an external candidate.

By recommending Vaswani, a senior citizen of nearly 63 years of age, and ignoring internal talent for the CEO position, the board of directors, and especially the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of KMB, have abysmally failed in developing CEO succession in a bank in which senior leadership have been long-serving KMB/Kotak group employees. In nationalised banks, CEOs have to retire by 60 years of age, while in the State Bank of India, the retirement age is 62 years.

Apte, the chairman, is “pleased”, and Uday Kotak, founder and non-executive non-independent director, is “delighted” to have a nearly 63-year-old individual as the next CEO of the bank. It’s worth noting that his Linkedin profile says he quit commercial banking in July 2022, and that he has banking experience outside India.

Chairman of the Board and members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee

The board of directors should have been long-term planning for CEO succession. This was the primary responsibility of KMB’s Nomination and Remuneration Committee, chaired by Amit Desai until FY2018, and subsequently by Farida Khambata until FY2022. Additionally, Apte, the board’s chairman, has been a member of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee since FY2015.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee role in CEO succession

Over the last nine years, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee’s role in CEO succession was to ensure that with the exception of two individuals, the entire top leadership were senior citizens by FY2023 to succeed Uday Kotak. Even if the Nomination and Remuneration Committee had admitted its failure in grooming younger internal talent for CEO succession, they could have shortlisted external executives in their mid-50s who have an exposure to Indian banking, and brought them in as executive directors at an earlier date, in order to expose them to KMB’s work environment, culture and senior executives.

Now Vaswani, with negligible experience in Indian banking, will be parachuted from a pleasant retirement from global commercial banking directly into the KMB CEO post. On landing, he is expected to do wonders in implementing a digital strategy in the Indian environment.

An alternative explanation for the selection of Vaswani is that he was a last-minute selection; the banking regulator, the RBI, may have informed the KMB board that it would not approve an internal candidate, as it was uncomfortable with Uday Kotak’s continuance on the board as a non-executive director. This analyst had argued that Uday Kotak’s retention on the board as a non-executive non-independent director would make him effectively the back-seat driver of the bank, without any of the associated responsibilities that come with such a position. It is poor corporate governance to allow a long-serving promoter CEO to continue on the board as a non-executive director after stepping down as the CEO.

If Vaswani’s selection was made under such circumstances, on account of Uday Kotak’s continuance on the board, then again the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the board have to be held accountable.

For the last five years, KMB’s stock has been underperforming as compared to Nifty-50 and Bank Nifty. This could be attributed to apprehensions regarding a leadership change.

The stock market was in favour of an insider to succeed Uday Kotak, as it would have indicated continuity in the bank’s strategy. Moreover, the market was familiar with the bank’s senior executives. The announcement of a relatively unknown external candidate, with negligible experience in Indian banking, and who had apparently retired from commercial banking, is expected to make the stock market even more apprehensive.

Uday Kotak’s continuance on the board

The KMB board and its Nomination and Remuneration Committee have failed stakeholders by recommending Uday Kotak’s continuance as a non-executive non-independent director, which may have resulted in regulatory displeasure and consequently led to the last-minute selection of an external retired global banker as the CEO.

Having Uday Kotak’s presence on the board will make it extremely difficult for Vaswani to forge an independent policy for the bank. If there is a disagreement between him and Vaswani on future strategy, or if senior executives undermine Vaswani’s authority and consult with Uday Kotak, or if there is a difference of opinion on a further fast-track promotion for Jay Kotak, the son of Uday Kotak, who will prevail? Whom will the board support?

A long-serving promoter CEO, who continues on the board as a non-executive non-independent director, undermines the authority of not only the CEO, but also the chairman of the board.

While addressing board members of urban co-operative banks on September 25 and commenting on the excessive dominance of one or two directors at board meetings of large commercial banks, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, had said:

“We have told banks that this is not the way. One or two directors cannot dominate, excessively dominate. They should not think that whatever they say is correct and others do not get a chance to speak.”

This analyst has repeatedly highlighted (here and here) the major risk associated with KMB, concerning the calibre of the bank’s board of directors. The selection of Vaswani as the CEO reinforces this concern.

"Across India, People Face Charges for Participating in Protests in Support of Palestine",https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/india-palestine-protests-police-crackdown,"Oct 26, 2023  |  Sukanya Shantha","Mumbai: Over the past weeks, innumerable protests – some impromptu and a few by rights organisations – have been organised across many big and small cities in India. These protests, largely peaceful, and an organic coming together of those seeking an end to Israel’s siege and relentless bombing of Gaza, have, however, not gone well with the Indian state.

Irrespective of which government is in power and what the political party’s stand has been on the ongoing conflict in West Asia, protestors in many states are facing criminal action for acts of “unlawful assembly” to promote “enmity between two groups”.

India’s long-standing position – reiterated by the Narendra Modi government – on the Israel-Palestine conflict is that it supports a “negotiated solution resulting in a sovereign, independent, viable and united State of Palestine, within secure and recognised borders, at peace beside Israel as endorsed in the relevant UNSC and UNGA Resolutions”.

But in a democracy where the right to protest peacefully is guaranteed and the government recognises the rights of Palestinians, here are a few instances when police cases were registered against protestors.

As one of the first responses to the Israel-Gaza war, several students of the Aligarh Muslim University took out a rally on October 9. This peaceful rally, organised as an expression of solidarity with Palestinians, landed at least four students in trouble as the police booked them under Sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, language, etc), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), and 505(statements inducing public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The state chief minister Yogi Adityanath, soon after the AMU protest, directed the police to take “stern action” against actions or social media posts in support of Palestine. According to a report in the Deccan Herald, senior district police officials have been directed to speak to the Muslim clerics and make it clear that “any attempt to incite passion on social media or a similar call from the religious places will not be tolerated”.

A cop, belonging to the Muslim community, posted in Lakhimpur Kheri district in Uttar Pradesh, had merely shared a pro-Palestine post on social media. Within days, he was suspended from duty and an additional superintendent of police rank officer was appointed to carry out an inquiry about the constable and “his political inclination”.

In similar incidents, the police in Kanpur booked two young Muslim clerics, Suhail Ansari and Atif Chowdhary, for posting content in support of Palestine on social media. While Ansari was arrested, the police raided Chowdhary’s residence.

Uttar Pradesh, however, is not the only one to crack down on protestors.

In Delhi, the state police, along with the Rapid Action Force had, on October 17, detained two busloads of protesters who came for a “Citizens’ Vigil” against Israel’s offensive on Gaza.

On the two Fridays since the war began, Muslims were barred from offering prayers at Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, Kashmir. Police closed down the iconic masjid, apprehending protests. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, the chairman of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, who was recently allowed to offer Friday prayers and deliver the Friday sermon at Jama Masjid after four years of house detention, was once again put under house arrest on October 15 and is not being allowed to step out of his house.

Starting with the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, the violence in West Asia has so far claimed the lives of 1,400 Israelis and over 5,100 Palestinians. According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, about 40% of the Palestinians killed are children.

If the response to the protests in BJP-governed states was not surprising, surely the actions of the police in Congress states are. The Congress condemned the Hamas attack on Israel but also reiterated its long-standing support for the rights of Palestinian people. As the conflict escalated, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) – the party’s highest decision-making body – passed a resolution in support of the Palestinian people’s struggle. Party leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Jairam Ramesh spoke in support of Palestine.

But in Karnataka, the police’s actions were diametrically opposite.

The Cubbon Park police in Bengaluru booked 11 persons, including a member of the Bahutva Karnataka (a citizen’s group), and other unnamed people for holding a solidarity gathering in support of Palestine on MG Road. While the police haven’t booked them for “promoting enmity”, the sections applied are largely for gathering without permission and for “public nuisance”. The problem, however, was not gathering without permission but denial of one. Almost all groups planning protests across India have been denied requisite permissions.

The Mumbai police in Maharashtra went a step ahead by not just detaining the protestors but also allegedly beat them up. Two young activists of the Revolutionary Workers Party of India (RWPI) – Ruchit Lad and Supreeth Ravish – were arrested on October 13. According to the Mumbai police, RWPI had planned to organise a protest in the Matunga-Dadar area regarding the Israel-Palestine clash. The police, as expected, denied permission. Supreeth and Ruchit then decided to hold placards in the Lallubhai compound area in Mankhurd and protested against the Israeli government. Soon, other youths joined them.

Ruchit and Supreeth were subsequently arrested under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 332 (punishment for the offence of voluntarily causing harm in order to deter a public worker from doing his duties), along with other sections of rioting under the IPC. When the duo was produced before a Magistrate court, Ruchit alleged that he was brutally assaulted in police custody.

While they have secured bail in the case, the two are yet to be released from jail."
Israel Asks India To Declare Hamas as a Terrorist Organisation,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/israel-asks-india-to-declare-hamas-as-a-terrorist-organisation,"Oct 25, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: Israel has asked India to declare Hamas as a terror organisation, Israeli ambassador Naor Gilon said on Wednesday.

In an interaction with reporters, Gilon said that Israel had asked Indian authorities to designate Hamas as a terrorist organisation following its terror attack on southern Israel on October 7, which left around 1,200 people dead.

“It is time for India to declare Hamas a terrorist organisation in India,” he said.

Gilon also indicated that this request had also been made earlier to India.

He also thanked India for its “100%” support to Israel in its anti-terror operations against Hamas.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among first world leaders to condemn the terror attack… India is a very important moral voice in the world and the important countries for us are with us,” Gilon said.

“India is solidly supporting us in our counter-terror operations,” he added.

Following the October 7 attack, Israel launched a massive counter-offensive in Gaza, which has killed over 5,000 people

“For Israel, it is a war to survive in the Middle East,” Gilon was as saying quoted by the news agency PTI, asserting that Israel is determined to destroy Hamas.

He said that Israeli action against Hamas aims to prevent the organisation from repeating the “brutality it has previously perpetrated”."
"Chart: US, Australia, Canada Added 100,000 New Citizens From India in 2021",https://m.thewire.in/article/world/chart-us-australia-canada-added-100000-new-citizens-from-india-in-2021,"Oct 26, 2023  |  Katharina Buchholz","Indians were the nationality most likely to acquire the citizenship of an OECD country in 2021, a new report from the organisation has shown. In the latest year available, more than 100,000 Indians became citizens of the US, Australia and Canada – the most popular destinations for people emigrating from the country. More than 11,000 Indians also received a passport of the United Kingdom.

While this made India the top origin country of new citizens for the four aforementioned nations, the rest of the list looks different. 2,700 new citizens originating from India made them the second-largest group of naturalised New Zealanders in 2021, while just under 2,000 newly minted Spanish citizens of Indian origin only amounted to rank 19. The Netherlands and Sweden accepted just as many new Indian citizens – around 1,700 and 1,600, respectively – ranks 5 and 12.

India remained the most common former nationality of new OECD citizens despite a drop of 15% compared with 2019 naturalisation numbers. As these data points have not returned to pre-pandemic levels across the board, Mexico remained in second spot with a similar drop and “virtually all” former Mexican nationals becoming US citizens, according to the OECD. With a rise of more than 150% opposite 2019, Syria was the third most common former nationality of new OECD citizens. After many Syrians left their home country in the mid-2010 due to the country’s civil war, they are now becoming citizens in their new countries of residence, for example Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany.

India To Partially Resume Visa Services in Canada From Thursday,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-to-resume-visa-services-in-canada-from-thursday,"Oct 25, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India announced on Wednesday, October 25, that it will partially reinstate visa services to Canadian citizens, which were suspended last month amid a diplomatic crisis between the two countries.

Starting Thursday, the Indian high commission in Ottawa and consulates in Vancouver and Toronto will resume services for entry, business, medical and conference visas.

“Further decisions, as appropriate, would be intimated based on continuing evaluation of the situation,” a media statement from the high commission said.

India suspended visa services on September 21, citing alleged ‘security threats’ against diplomatic staff after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged, a few days prior, that Indian agents were linked to the killing of a Canadian Sikh in Vancouver in June. Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Khalistan activist, was accused of terrorism in India.

Earlier this week, Indian external affairs minister S. Jaishankar said the government was reviewing the “security situation” around India’s missions in Canada and indicated that if there is substantial “progress” in ensuring the safety of diplomats, the resumption of visa services could occur “very soon”.

The media statement issued by the high commission said, “After a considered review of the security situation that takes into account some recent Canadian measures in this regard, it has been decided to resume visa services for the following categories with effect from October 26, 2023…”

The development will come as a reprieve to Canadian citizens of Indian origin, who were unable to travel to India over the past month if they did not have an OCI card.

The development comes just five days after Canada announced that it had withdrawn 41 diplomats from India and stopped in-person facilities at three consulates in the country after New Delhi sought ‘parity’ in diplomatic staff. Ottawa said that visa processing times for Indian applicants would increase as a consequence.

On Wednesday, Canadian immigration minister Marc Miller told a parliamentary standing committee that out of the 38,000 visas for Indians, only 20,000 will now be processed by the end of the year.

Canada’s immigration department foresees a backlog of about 17,500 Indian applications at the start of 2024. Out of the 41 diplomats who left India, about half were dealing with visa issues. Currently, there are just five immigration officials working in the Canadian high commission.

Earlier, Canada’s missions in India used to process around 15,000 visas a week, in total.

After India had publicly dismissed the allegations made by Trudeau in the House of Commons, it had sought “parity” and furnished a list of names to the Canadian side whose diplomatic immunity would be revoked if they did not leave by October 10, which was later extended by 10 days.

Canadian foreign minister Mélanie Joly said India violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations when it unilaterally threatened to remove the diplomatic immunity of accredited journalists. India has, however, claimed that its actions were as per Article 11.1 of the 1961 treaty.

India also has publicly said, which Jaishankar reiterated on Sunday, that Canadian diplomats were interfering in India’s internal affairs. However, India has never publicly mentioned any specific instances.

After the US and UK supported Canada’s contention that India had violated the Vienna Convention, New Zealand also joined the chorus on Wednesday.

“We are concerned India’s demand that Canada reduce its diplomatic presence there has led to the departure of a large number of Canadian diplomats from India. Now seems the time for more diplomacy, not less,” tweeted the New Zealand foreign ministry.

It added that all states were expected to “uphold their obligations under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, including in relation to the privileges and immunities of accredited staff”.

Canada is part of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network along with the US, UK, New Zealand and Australia.

Last month, the US ambassador to Canada David Cohen said that intelligence input from the Five Eyes network contributed to Trudeau’s decision to go public with the allegations against India.

More recently, Australia’s domestic spy chief Mike Burgess had said that there was “no reason to dispute” claims by Canada of Indian involvement in Nijjar’s killing.

After Canada and its Five Eyes allies repeatedly called on India to cooperate with the investigation, New Delhi has said that it was willing to look at information shared by Canada related to the killing."
Adani Auditor EY Faces Inquiry by India’s Accounting Regulator: Report,https://m.thewire.in/article/business/adani-auditor-ey-faces-inquiry-by-indias-accounting-regulator-report,"Oct 25, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India’s accounting regulator, the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), has initiated an inquiry against one of EY’s member firms in the country, S.R. Batliboi, which audits certain Adani Group companies, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter, on Wednesday (October 25).

According to the report, the NFRA’s inquiry began in recent weeks. The National Financial Reporting Authority has requested documents and communications related to the audits of Adani-controlled companies dating back to 2014, it said.

S.R. Batliboi currently audits five of Adani’s listed firms – Adani Power, Adani Green Energy, Adani Wilmar, and recently acquired cement companies ACC and Ambuja Cements.

It, however, remains unclear how long the NFRA’s inquiry could take or what repercussions, if any, could be faced by the auditor or the audited, Bloomberg said.

Bloomberg News sought comments from the auditor and the Adani Group. Both parties did not respond. A representative for EY and S.R. Batliboi also declined to comment, as per the report.

In August, Deloitte, Haskins & Sells LLP had resigned as the statutory auditors of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ).

In May, the audit firm had flagged some transactions by Adani Group, citing allegations from US-based short seller Hindenburg Research’s report that wiped off half of the market value of the ports-to-power conglomerate.

In the same month, Ahme­dabad-based chartered accountancy firm Shah Dhandharia & Co. – which was named in Hindenburg Research’s report – had resigned as statutory auditor of Adani Total Gas. It told the Telegraph that it had decided to resign “due to increased professional preoccupation in other assignments”.

In October 2022, the Morning Context had reported that two accountancy firms – Shah Dhandharia & Co. and Dharmesh Parikh & Co. – that audit most of Adani Group companies have links to each other, and therefore, raise concerns over the group’s corporate governance.

It further said that Adani Group paid them a little over Rs 7 crore, as compared to Rs 84 crore paid by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries.

She said that she was surprised that Indians, who have experienced the cruelty of colonialism, fail to connect with the plight of the people of Gaza, which has faced the brunt of settler colonialism at the hands of Israel. How can Indians wish for the extermination of the occupied people of Gaza and wish victory for the occupier Israel?

There are many reasons for the change that India has gone through in the recent past. One reason for this change is the fading memory of English colonialism, with the Mughals/Muslims being increasingly seen as the real colonisers.

The world, yet to come to terms with the change in the imagination of the Hindu majority, was surprised to see massive support for the Israeli war against the Palestinians coming from India. One person noted that it was amusing to see the maximum number of social media posts calling for an end to the war in Hebrew and the maximum number of posts calling for the annihilation of Gaza in Hindi.

He may have been exaggerating, but it is true that there was an obscene glee in the Indian media after Israel started to bomb Gaza in retaliation for the surprise Hamas attack which killed more than 1,300 Israelis, most of them civilians, and took more than 200 Israelis as hostages to be exchanged with more than 5,000 Palestinians, including children and women.

One has to be fair to the Indian media. It was after all not very different from its Western counterpart, which was demonstratively partisan towards Israel. A majority of TV channels and newspapers actively decontextualised the Hamas attack and also failed to see and point out the visible disproportionality in the Israeli ‘response’. The killing of Israeli children and women outraged them. But the killing of Gazan babies by the indiscriminate bombing was because of Hamas embedding themselves within the civilian population.

The attack on civilians was justified by suggesting that without their support, Hamas would not thrive. If they were not revolting against Hamas, they were complicit.

The Western media and political leadership kept calling the Hamas attack ‘unprovoked’, totally neglecting the underlying context – which includes the daily violence against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, not only by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) but also by settlers who are given arms and cover by the Israeli state to loot and steal Palestinian land and houses and even kill.

Calling out this dishonesty, Amira Hass, a veteran Israeli-Jewish journalist, plainly said that history did not begin on October 7, 2023. The Hamas attack, she said, may not have happened if Israel had not committed unspeakable atrocities on the Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and even Jerusalem.

But the Indian media went berserk, asking for the total destruction of and predicting the end of Gaza. It seems to have taken a cue from the first reaction of its chief editor, who also happens to be the prime minister of India. Narendra Modi took to X (formerly Twitter) immediately and said, “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour.”

The Indian big media tried to portray this statement as Modi‘s entry into the war against ‘terror’, which, according to it, has driven fear in the heart of Hamas.

But others noted that India had associated its reputation with Israel and forsaken its role as a voice of moderation, which it has performed historically since independence. While expressing shock at the Hamas attack, India could have asked for restraint, by calling upon Israel not to target the civilian population of Gaza. Only five days later, it tried to correct its official position when it reiterated its stand for a sovereign Palestine.

Even after 18 days of the Israeli bombing of Gaza, India has not called for a ceasefire. It has not called upon the international community to mediate. That indicates that it is allowing Israel to continue its genocidal attack on the civilian population of Gaza.

An election agenda?

A journalist friend of mine, who lives in Chandigarh, told me he is worried about the impact of the Israeli ‘war’ on the state elections to be held next month. His worry is not misplaced. If you follow the big media, which acts like a mouthpiece of the ruling BJP, you can see that the trope of terror is being used to vilify Muslims. It is suggested that Islamic countries should accommodate Palestinians and make Gaza available to Israel. This is what they have been wishing for Indian Muslims: to be packed off to Pakistan.

It is not hard to ascertain that the conflict in West Asia would be used – is already being used – to demonise Muslims.

The BJP’s propaganda cell is working overtime to tell its constituents that Palestinian ‘terror’ is a result of the policies of Indira Gandhi or the Congress party. The Congress party’s stand after the Hamas attack was different from Modi’s. It did condemn the Hamas attack but immediately called for a ceasefire: “The CWC calls for an immediate ceasefire and for negotiations to begin on all outstanding issues including the imperative issues that have given rise to the present conflict.” It did not take time to ask for the rights of the Palestinians to be respected and spoke for their independence.

Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma compared the stand of the Congress party with that of Pakistan. He taunted Sharad Pawar, who had talked about the rights of the Palestinians over their land and resources and said that all Indian prime ministers had stood firmly with Palestine, by asking Pawar to send his daughter Supriya Sule to fight for Hamas.

Another BJP leader, Piyush Goyal said: “Pawar ji was a part of the same government that shed tears on the Batla House encounter and slept while there were terror attacks on Indian soil…”

It is very disturbing when a senior leader like @PawarSpeaks ji makes preposterous statements on India’s stand on a terror attack in Israel. The menace of terrorism has to be condemned in all forms, in any part of the world. It is a pity that a person who has been India’s Defence… — Piyush Goyal (@PiyushGoyal) October 18, 2023

Support for Palestine is being treated as support for terrorism. You can be booked or jailed for supporting Palestine in India. Protests are not allowed by the government.

The increasing support for Israel in India is in consonance with the rise of anti-Muslim, anti-minority politics represented by the BJP. The idea of Israel as a country in which Jews are first-class citizens and others second is attractive to the BJP supporters, who want Hindus to be treated similarly in India. They want India to become a majoritarian democracy like Israel. They also share the sentiments of Israeli Jews who consider Palestinians as lesser humans who are unlike them in all matters.

Outsiders are puzzled by the support of the BJP, or its parent body the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, for Israel. Did it not endorse the notion of the Nazi ‘Final Solution’ for the Jewish question? How can it now justify its support for Jews?

This paradox can be explained by the RSS and BJP’s belief in the idea of dominance. They admire those who dominate and use violence to maintain their dominance over others. A hundred years ago, the Nazis were the dominant power. Now it is Israel. The RSS worshipped Hitler then, now it is a disciple of Israel.

My journalist friend was also perturbed by the silence on campuses. Why is our youth not speaking out? There are many reasons. But one reason is that they are not adequately informed. They depend on TV Big Media and WhatsApp for inforamation.

Note that even the nearly six-month-long violence in Manipur has not been able to stir the imagination of the rest of India. There are hardly any public protests demanding peace there. It is impossible for them to think about Palestine. For them, there is an entity called Israel which is being threatened by terrorists led by Hamas. Palestine does not seem to exist in their imagination.

There are people who invoke Gandhi and Nehru to speak for the rights of the Palestinians. But a significant section of Hindus now believe that India has to correct the “wrongs” committed by those great leaders. Israel is cited as an ideal in these circles. Its violent methods to control people perhaps appeal to them.

Moreover, there is no parallel education about liberation struggles in India. Given the shift in demographics, with NFHS-5 revealing that 52% of Indians are under the age of 30, present-day Indians do not have a memory of apartheid South Africa and know little of the stellar role India’s political leadership took in mobilising international opinion against it.

More than that, one needs to accept that a lot of Indians are not averse to some kind of apartheid as they themselves believe in a caste-segregated society, with entrenched notions of hierarchy and dominance. Israel has achieved this. It may, therefore, be a reflex to admire it."
"Punjab: As India-Canada Row Escalates, Visa Delays Worry Students, Businesses Report Losses",https://m.thewire.in/article/education/punjab-india-canada-row-visa-delays-students-business-losses,"Oct 25, 2023  |  Kusum Arora","Jalandhar: For the past few days, Jalandhar resident Simran (20) and her parents have been facing a dilemma: should she apply for a Canadian study visa now or defer until the diplomatic ties between New Delhi and Ottawa show signs of a recovery?

Simran’s fears are not unfounded. Diplomatic ties between the two countries have been in a downward spiral since mid-September, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons that Indian agents were linked to the killing of Canadian Sikh citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Khalistan activist who was wanted in India for terrorism charges. India rejected the allegations and later shut down visa services to Canadian citizens.

Tensions escalated further on October 19, after Canada complied with India’s demand to withdraw 41 diplomats posted in India, suspending consular services in Chandigarh, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. This is likely to cause delays in visa services and longer waits at the Canadian Embassy in New Delhi for in-person submissions.

Simran said, “As of now, my parents have asked me to first complete my IELTS coaching and get a good score. We will plan the study visa later. If the situation between India and Canada does not improve by then, I will have to pursue graduation in Jalandhar.”

Since IELTS test scores are valid for two years, Simran said many of her friends are also planning to “complete the exam first and then wait for the right time to apply for a study visa”.

In fact, those who visited the Canadian consulate in Chandigarh on October 19 to avail of services were turned back. Applicants also say fake news about the issue is worsening the confusion and chaos.

Another student Sunaina, who was taking IELTS coaching from an institute in Phagwara in the Kapurthala district, said, “Study visas are time-bound, as the students get admission according to the seat availability in the next semester and pay a hefty fee in dollars. We are deeply concerned.”

Sunaina’s village in Jalandhar, Ganna, has high levels of drug abuse, petty crime, and violence. Parents prefer to send their children abroad for education so that they can escape these circumstances.

“Our village is infamous as a haven for drug peddlers. Hardly a day passes when we do not witness petty crime, police raids, and arrests of drug peddlers or fights in the streets. People in our village have either moved to the cities or emigrated. The lack of quality jobs and wages is a huge concern too. Youth today want value for the money invested in education, which is assured if you move abroad,” she said.

Education consultants worried over visa delays

Despite withdrawing 41 diplomats from India, Canada’s immigration minister Marc Miller said that Canada would continue to accept and process all temporary and permanent resident applications from India.

The minister also informed that the remaining staff will continue to focus on the work that cannot be moved out of the country, such as urgent cases, visa printing, and working with visa application centres and the panel physicians who conduct the important immigration medical examination for the applicants. “Visa application centres are run by third-party contractors (VFS Global) and would not be affected,” he said.

However, education consultants say fewer diplomatic staff in India and the suspension of consular services in three major cities will inevitably mean an increase in visa processing times.

Kuljit Hayer, who owns Jalandhar-based Universal Travels, told The Wire, “With diplomatic staff reduced to just one-third, the processing time of applications will be longer. The impact would not be limited to student visa cases but to visitor visa and Permanent Residency (PR) applications too. Basically, Punjabis will suffer in both cases – whether it is because of India’s suspension of visa services to Canadian citizens or those applying for visas from India. However, given the current scenario, the Canadian government may focus more on study visas, as they are time-bound and subject to a student’s admission in a college or university.”

Hayer also pointed out that the downturn in diplomatic ties between India and Canada have resulted in a loss of business to travel agents. “Overnight 250 to 300 air tickets were cancelled in the past few days. Many families had to postpone weddings,” he said.

“While the Indian government has completely suspended visas for Canadian citizens, the Canadian government’s work will be slower now. We can just hope that this situation improves gradually.”

‘Mass rejections unlikely’

However, Pamsy Singh Sehmbey, a consultant based in Toronto, said that despite the recent escalation, the Canadian authorities were in no mood to ruin their relations with India.

“Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau has made this clear. There might be some delay in the processing time of applications, but I am sure it will not lead to mass rejection of visas. Even now, the processing time for study visas is around 22 days, and 31 days for visitor visas. The dates for biometric services, which are mandatory for Canadian visas, are easily available at VFS Global, a third-party service. Similarly, dates for medical tests for visas are also available as per schedule. I think people should keep applying,” she said.

Contrary to this, Kanwaljit Kaur, branch manager of Golden Pillars Immigration in Jalandhar, said that ever since Canada was asked to withdraw 41 diplomats, prospective applicants are thinking twice because they fear an unexplained rejection.

“See, nobody wants their visa application rejected. As of now, people have stopped applying for Canadian visas. Since the Canadian authorities have said there might be an increase in processing time, people are concerned. Earlier, the processing time for study visas was around 15 to 30 days. However, it might go up to two months. We are suggesting clients wait for now, as Canada did not stop issuing visas during the COVID-19 pandemic. We would request people to remain aware of the latest updates and beware of fake news,” she said.

Weddings cancelled and businesses affected

A Jalandhar-based couple, Sandeep Singh and Sandeep Kaur, said their Canadian cousin was supposed to get married on October 21. The groom failed to get a visa following the Indian government’s suspension of visa services to Canadian citizens and the ceremony had to be cancelled.

“Nearly half of the groom’s relatives are based in the US and others are in the UK. Almost all of them had booked air tickets for the wedding in Hoshiarpur district. They had to postpone the wedding. The groom’s family had printed the wedding cards while the bride’s family had booked the marriage palace. It led to a big financial loss,” Sandeep Singh said.

Singh said that the bride and the groom’s families were eagerly waiting for India-Canada relations to normalise. “We hope that the Indian government reconsiders its decision and allows People of Indian Origin (PIOs) to visit their homeland for reunions, weddings, and functions,” he said.

The regions of Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur, and Nawanshahr – which have a sizeable number of Punjabis settled in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Europe – are famous for hiring private jets, luxury wedding cars, Punjabi singers, bhangra groups and hotels for weddings and other occasions.

The usually busy NRI markets of Jalandhar, Phagwara, and Ludhiana have been bearing the brunt of fewer visitors. “Our business has been badly affected. The onset of winter in Punjab means NRI and PIO season for us. We look forward to a big boost in revenue, as weddings, functions, and family visits take place from October to April. However, this year, the market is slow,” said Vidya Sagar from Madaan Cloth House, Phagwara.

A showroom owner, also from Phagwara, said that an NRI wedding means flourishing business for every sector. The owner cited the example of a UK-based that landed in Jalandhar for a wedding last year. “Not only did they buy traditional dresses and jewellery worth several lakhs, but they stayed in three of the top hotels of Jalandhar, spending a whopping amount.”"
"Despite India'S Reluctance, Russia Presses For Export Payments In Yuan",https://m.thewire.in/article/trade/despite-indias-reluctance-russia-presses-for-export-payments-in-yuan,"Oct 25, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: With Russian exporters showing preference to be paid in yuan, India’s trade with Russia in Chinese currency is gathering pace to tide over the payment crisis between countries since the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022.

Two sources, who are in the know of things, quoted by LiveMint, said this payment mechanism is being run through global financial centres like Singapore and Dubai.

With the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia following the Ukraine war, Russia has been redirecting most of its energy exports to Asia, and of them, most are being bought by China. While Russia and China have been able to settle their trade in yuans and rubles, India has been struggling to figure out a smooth mechanism to continue its trade with Russia.

Due to the greater acceptability of the yuan in global markets, Russian exporters are happy being paid in yuan by Indian traders, one of the two sources quoted above said, on the condition of anonymity.

With this development, India’s efforts to push the rupee in global trade have taken a hit. In particular, India has not been able to convince Russia to accept its payments in rupees, as the trade deficit between the two countries swelled sevenfold in the last fiscal year alone, crossing $40 billion.

There were reports about five days back (on October 20) that the Narendra Modi government had rejected requests from Russian exports to make transactions in yuan. The Indian government’s unease over letting state-controlled refiners pay in Chinese yuan for massive Russian oil imports had “held up the payment for at least seven cargoes“, as on October 17."

Of the total, 3,059 Indians were arrested from the US-Canada border alone, data from the US Customs and Border Protection has revealed.

The number of Indians arrested on the US-Canada border in September is the highest number of such arrests carried out in a month in the period between October 2022 and September 2023.

According to The Times of India, a source said, “Many illegal immigrants, primarily from Gujarat, have either settled in Canada or are awaiting an opportunity to enter the US. In August, 2,327 illegal immigrants were caught trying to cross over to the US. This number rose to 3,059 in September.”

Those arrested also include four unaccompanied children; four other children, each accompanied by a family member; and 530 children with their parents and siblings. A total of 2,521 single adults were arrested.

Indians who attempt crossing over into the US illegally, typically do it through the US-Mexico border. According to the official figures, a total of 1.9 lakh Indians were arrested by US law enforcement agencies between February 2019 and March this year.

Attempts by Indians to illegally migrate to the US continue unabated despite a number of instances where several families have been killed during these perilous journeys. A family of four from Gujarat’s Gandhinagar froze to death in January 2022 when they tried to enter the US illegally through the US-Canada border. Another Gujarat family drowned in the St. Lawrence River in April this year trying to immigrate to the US unlawfully."
"India to Witness Largest Energy Demand Globally by 2050, Power for ACs to Spike Nine-Fold: Report",https://m.thewire.in/article/energy/india-to-witness-largest-energy-demand-globally-by-2050-power-for-acs-to-spike-nine-fold-report,"Oct 25, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: With the rising number of household air conditioners, India is set to see by 2050 a nine-fold spike in terms of electricity required for running them and will exceed the total power consumption in the whole of Africa today, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its latest report.

In the coming three decades, India will see the largest energy demand growth of any country or region in the world, PTI cited IEA’s latest World Energy Outlook as saying.

According to the projections, India’s energy supply is set to rise from 42 exajoules (EJ) in 2022 to 53.7 EJ in 2030, and 73 EJ in 2050 under its stated policy scenarios. It would touch 47.6 EJ by 2030 and 60.3 EJ by 2050 as per announced pledges.

India has witnessed, according to IEA, 700 heatwave events in the last five decades, which led to 17,000 deaths. Therefore, air conditioner ownership in India would go up massively in the coming decades with rising incomes. Geographical and meteorological conditions would also contribute to this spike. In fact, the number of air conditioners since 2010 has tripled, to reach 24 units per 100 households.

“The impact of cooling needs on electricity consumption is already clear. Electricity demand is sensitive to temperatures, and in India’s case, there is a sharp increase in demand as temperatures cross the 25-degree Celsius threshold…,” said IEA in its report.

Continuing further, it said, “Household air conditioner ownership is estimated to expand ninefold by 2050 across the IEA scenarios, outpacing the growth in ownership of every other major household appliance including televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines.”

The IEA report also said India is moving towards a dynamic new phase as part of its energy development marked by a long-term net zero emissions ambition, increased regulatory sophistication, a focus on clean energy deployment, and the creation of domestic clean energy technology supply chains.

Similarly, the demand for oil is estimated to go up from 5.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2022 to 6.8 million bpd in 2030 and 7.8 million bpd in 2050 under the stated policy scenario. As per announced pledges, the demand would shoot up to 6.2 million bpd in 2030 and 4.7 million bpd in 2050."
Odisha: Is V.K. Pandian a Step Closer To Becoming Naveen Patnaik’s Successor?,https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/vk-pandian-step-closer-naveen-patnaik-successor,"Oct 25, 2023  |  Ruben Banerjee","Odisha has more than 200 serving IAS officers, but it is only one of them who is hogging all the headlines.

Ever since the news broke late Monday night that V. Karthikeyan Pandian – chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s trusted secretary for more than a decade – has taken voluntary retirement, the 49-year-old 2000-batch civil servant has taken centre-stage once again. There is renewed speculation as to what his role could be, post-retirement.

Appointed hours later as chairman of two Odisha government initiatives with a cabinet minister rank, the latest development is a sure sign that Pandian’s journey in public life is set for a fresh and frenzied start.

Though not made a functionary of the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) yet, there is little to doubt that Pandian hereafter will publicly dabble in politics – something that he did earlier only furtively.

Also, by virtue of being the closest confidant of the ageing chief minister, he will be seen as Patnaik’s possible successor.

Whether Pandian ultimately succeeds or not is an altogether different matter.

Under normal circumstances, few would have given Pandian very little realistic chance. A Tamilian by birth who came to be posted in Odisha only after marrying an Odia IAS officer, Pandian’s ‘outsider’ status should have ordinarily ruled him out for the state’s top elected post.

But Odisha in the past decade or so has witnessed a rather abnormal administrative arrangement. Under it, the elected CM has gradually receded to the background with all levers of state power being increasingly wielded by his secretary. It has made Pandian extremely powerful. Having packed the ruling party leadership with his men, his word is law. Even bureaucrats senior to him defer to him.

With both the party and the state machinery firmly under his control, the dice will be loaded in Pandian’s favour if he is to really pitch to take over the party when Patnaik exits the political stage. As social media posts in the immediate aftermath of his retirement show, there is no dearth of sycophants in the BJD. Most members of the ruling party are hailing Pandian as the new ‘messiah’ under whose leadership the state apparently will flourish and advance like never before.

Even opponents of the BJD say nothing is impossible in Odisha, a state which in the early 1960s had a Bengali chief minister in one Biren Mitra.

Also, when Patnaik himself took over as chief minister, he spoke no Odia. It didn’t stop him from ruling the state for the next two decades.

With a popular Patnaik solidly by his side, it is possible that Pandian too may manage to secure enough public acceptability.

Pandian stands to gain by quitting the IAS. Though all-powerful, he has rubbed too many senior bureaucrats the wrong way by bossing over them. These angry seniors would have made his continuation in the IAS impossible when Patnaik is not around.

Politics holds out better prospects instead.

As it is, his public profile has shot up immensely since he crisscrossed the state in recent months, hearing public grievances on behalf of the chief minister. His travels in helicopters and elaborate convoys kicked up a political controversy with critics accusing him of over-stepping his authority. But they also allowed Pandian to connect with tens of thousands of people. The message too has gone out that Pandian is trusted by Patnaik.

That is huge political capital that Pandian surely will bank upon. A bachelor, Patnaik has no designated successor. And should he ever publicly bat for Pandian, then that becomes a done deal with Pandian becoming the sole repository of all the goodwill that exists for the chief minister.

But there’s always a gap between the lip and the cup and Pandian needs to tread cautiously. Though it is for sure that men and women who will get BJD tickets to contest the 2024 elections will mostly be his chosen ones, there are surely some leaders in the party who have not taken his meteoric rise kindly. In a scenario when Patnaik is not around, they may not keep quiet and meekly accept Pandian’s leadership.

But that will be then. For now, the Patnaik-Pandian duo is succeeding in controlling the circumstances. They are creating situations and then setting the political narrative that the opposition is struggling to challenge. They have not even been able to turn the tables over Pandian’s emergence. Though Odias may not be overwhelmingly in favour of a secretary reigning supreme, they have not voiced their displeasure strongly as well. The ambivalence allows Pandian and his supporters to dream big."
"China, Bhutan Vow to Conclude Border Talks Soon; Will Have Implications for India",https://m.thewire.in/article/south-asia/china-bhutan-vow-to-conclude-border-talks-soon-will-have-implications-for-india,"Oct 24, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: China says it is ready to work with Bhutan to conclude the ongoing boundary talks “as soon as possible” and to establish full diplomatic relations with the Himalayan Kingdom. The development also has implications for India.

Bhutan’s foreign minister Tandi Dorji was in Beijing on Monday, October 23, to hold talks with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi.

“The conclusion of boundary negotiations and the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Bhutan fully serve the long-term and fundamental interests of the country and nation of Bhutan. China is ready to work with Bhutan in the same direction, seize the historic opportunity, complete this important process as soon as possible, and fix and develop China-Bhutan friendly relations in legal form,” a statement put out by the Chinese foreign ministry said.

Of the 14 nations with which China shares borders, 12 countries have settled their borders. Bhutan and India are the only two countries with which border disputes still remain.

According to the statement, Wang Yi told his Bhutanese counterpart, “China always prioritises neighbourhood diplomacy in its overall diplomacy and adheres to the principle that all countries, big or small, are equals. China respects the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all countries and the legitimate aspirations and concerns of small and medium-sized countries.”

The Bhutanese foreign minister, according to the Chinese statement, said Bhutan and China have enjoyed a traditional friendship, and Bhutan firmly abides by the one-China principle and stands ready to work with China for an early settlement of the boundary issue and advance the political process of establishing diplomatic relations. He also thanked China for “its strong support and assistance to Bhutan”, the statement added.

Last month, both countries set up a ‘Joint Technical Group’ (JTG) on the delimitation of the China-Bhutan boundary as part of Beijing’s efforts to speed up the resolution of the boundary issue. In an ‘Expert Group Meeting’ (EGM) held in Beijing in August, both sides had agreed to set up JTG, and to take “simultaneous steps” to expedite the implementation of a ‘three-step roadmap’ that will lead to the demarcation of the boundary.

Implications for India

China asserts claims over roughly 764 square kilometres in the northwestern and central regions of Bhutan. Originally, the dispute was part of border negotiations between India and China. However, direct dialogues between China and Bhutan were initiated in 1984. Since then, over 24 rounds of border talks and 12 rounds of expert-level meetings have taken place, which have been focusing on Jakarlung and Pasamlung areas in north Bhutan, and the Doklam area in west Bhutan.

India and China were locked in an intense standoff over Doklam in 2017 for about two months after China began laying a road towards the strategically significant Jampheri ridge line. While India considers the Doklam plateau as Bhutanese territory, China’s stated position is that it is an extension of its Chumbi Valley, located between Sikkim and Bhutan.

In June 2020, China also claimed the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary, located in eastern Bhutan, as its own. The region also shares borders with Arunachal Pradesh in India. China also allegedly built several villages in the Bhutanese territory, which Bhutan’s Prime Minister, Lotay Tshering, had dismissed in an interview with the Belgian newspaper La Libre in March.

Tshering had said that the demarcation of the Bhutan-China boundary would be settled at an early date, but the tri-junction point with India would be dealt with separately with the inclusion of India. “Doklam is a junction point between India, China and Bhutan. It is not up to Bhutan alone to fix the problem. There are three of us. There is no big or small country; all are three equal countries, each counting for one-third,” Tshering had said.

The Bhutanese prime minister had also said discussions on the tri-junction can only start once India and China have resolved their differences along their borders. “We are ready. We can discuss this as soon as the other two parties are ready. India and China have problems all along their border. We are waiting to see how they will settle their differences,” he had added.

For India, Doklam holds great significance from a security point of view. China’s control over the region would pose a threat to India’s Siliguri Corridor, a 22-km stretch which connects the Indian mainland to the Northeast. The stretch, commonly known as the Chicken’s Neck, links India with Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh."

More importantly, within 24 hours of quitting the country’s most elite service, Pandian was appointed chairman of 5T (transformational initiatives), a governance reform initiative, and of Nabin Odisha, a newly launched rural development scheme, in the rank of a cabinet minister.

An order issued by the state’s general administration department said that Pandian will work directly under the chief minister.

Speculation is rife that either he or his wife Sujata Karthikeyan, also a bureaucrat, will make a formal entry into politics in the near future. Pandian’s critics were quick to point out that he is assuming sweeping powers with almost no accountability.

“He will henceforth manage the affairs of both the government and the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD). He will wield sweeping powers and be answerable only to the chief minister, who has always given him a free hand. Pandian’s position, thus, has been further strengthened,” said Congress veteran and former minister Ganeswar Behera.

Pandian’s voluntary retirement came as no surprise for the likes of Behera, who have been watching his growth trajectory keenly.

“Any politically conscious person would have seen this coming. Earlier, he was calling the shots from behind the scenes, but now he will do this more directly,” Behera said.

He continued, “What is surprising, however, is the speed with which things have happened, taking even journalists by surprise. The letter seeking VRS went to the Union government on October 20 and he was relieved on October 23”, adding that speculation about Pandian’s entry into politics was natural.

“He has not resigned to do tapasya (penance). He is now looking to legitimise his authority,” said the Congress veteran, who does not rule out the possibility of Pandian’s wife Sujata also putting in her papers to take the plunge into politics.

Former state BJP president Samir Mohanty finds the timing of Pandian’s VRS important.

“It comes only months ahead of the general elections. It is obvious that he will be managing the entire election on behalf of the BJD. He did this earlier, too, but this time he will do it openly and directly. Henceforth he will be running both the government and the BJD organisation and no one will question his authority,” said Mohanty.

Though people had been making conjectures about Pandian’s resignation and his possible entry into politics, speculation in this regard intensified after he began touring districts using a state helicopter, which drew the opposition’s ire.

The ace bureaucrat was also targeted by BJD MLA and media baron Soumya Ranjan Patnaik, who questioned his visits and made a scathing attack on him in Sambad, the Odia daily founded by him. The retaliation was swift, with Ranjan Patnaik thrown out of the BJD.

Pandian’s closeness to Naveen Patnaik has never been in doubt. His efficiency and management skills were the talk of the power corridors in Bhubaneswar, with almost every move of the chief minister bearing his stamp.

Though born in Tamil Nadu, he has an Odisha connection: his wife Sujata (nee Rout) hails from the state’s Kendrapara district. Her father Akshay Kumar Rout, who passed away in 2020, was an eminent paediatrician.

Pandian has been the eyes and ears of the chief minister for the last 12 years. In the initial years, he took utmost care to ensure that he did not step out of his boss’s shadow, but slowly his activities earned public attention and brought him into focus.

His visits to different districts using a state helicopter drew opposition fire, as this was seen as an attempt by a bureaucrat to arrogate to himself the powers and privileges of a public representative. His visits drew large crowds and ruling party politicians were seen fawning upon him during these trips.

“Even though the chief minister himself clarified that Pandian was visiting the districts on his instructions, the controversy refused to die down. This could be one of the reasons why he took VRS and decided to assume a more direct role in the affairs of the state,” said political analyst Shashi Kant Mishra who, however, dismisses the speculation about Pandian contesting elections as political kite flying.

“I don’t see that happening in the near future. Even his wife, who is Odia, will think twice before taking the political plunge. Since the question about Naveen Patnaik’s successor remains unanswered, there is always room for speculation,” added Mishra.

Pandian’s efficiency as a bureaucrat was never in doubt. Apart from being the longest-serving private secretary to Odisha’s longest-serving chief minister, he was also the 5T (team work, technology, transparency, transformation and time limit) secretary of the state since 2019, entrusted with the task of ensuring good and pro-people governance with complete transparency.

He first came to the chief minister’s notice during his stint as the sub-collector of Dharamgarh in Kalahandi, once considered the proverbial backwaters of the state. The impact of his bold administrative moves was felt by the people of the area, who saw it transform at a rapid pace.

Pandian was among the youngest collectors in the country when he took charge of the tribal-majority Mayurbhanj district, where he accelerated the pace of development.

However, his most satisfying and fruitful tenure as a young IAS officer was as the collector of Ganjam, the district that Naveen Patnaik hails from.

The high degree of efficiency and transparency with which he implemented the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) in the district helped reduce the scale of labour migration from the area.

He also came up with innovative ideas like the transfer of wages to bank accounts, thus ruling out the possibility of corruption.

Since Pandian’s wife Sujata heads the newly created department of Mission Shakti, which aims at making women self-reliant, the couple is crucial to the political fortunes of Patnaik’s BJD.

Mission Shakti supports more than 70 lakh women organised under six lakh women’s self-help groups, which constitute a key vote-bank.

Player Power Over Personal Success: Bishan Singh Bedi's True Impact on Indian Cricket,https://m.thewire.in/article/sport/player-power-over-personal-success-bishan-singh-bedis-true-impact-on-indian-cricket,"Oct 24, 2023  |  Rajdeep Sardesai","One of India’s greatest cricketers Bishan Singh Bedi (77) breathed his last on Monday, October 23. This is an excerpt from Rajdeep Sardesai’s Democracy’s XI: The Great Indian Cricket Story, published by Juggernaut in 2017.

From 1966, when Bedi first represented India, to the tail end of his career in the late 1970s, India underwent a glorious spin revolution that would change Indian cricket forever. Brahma, the creator God in the Trimurti of Hinduism, has four faces looking in four different directions. But even he would have found it difficult to recreate the magic of India’s spin quartet which dominated the sport for a decade and more. And mirroring the country’s unique notion of unity in diversity, the four Indian spinners were distinctive individuals with sharply contrasting personalities but united in their purpose of taking wickets for India. It was like having four magicians perform in one show, each with a unique bag of tricks, each luring an unsuspecting batsman to his doom with their mastery over flight and turn.

Erapalli Prasanna, who made his debut in 1962, was the oldest of the four. He was a true-blue Kannadiga born in Shimoga, another remote corner in cricket’s metro-centric geography at the time. As an off-spinner, he was almost a right-arm version of Bedi, shorter and stockier but with the same instinct to play mind games with batsmen through his control over the spinning ball. ‘We were like Siamese twins I guess,’ he says with a chuckle. ‘We would share secrets and plot how to get a batsman out. It was almost as if we could read each other’s minds.’ Prasanna was a qualified engineer, even giving up the sport for five years after his first Test series because his father wanted him to complete his engineering degree first. ‘In those days, it was a case of studies first, then cricket. My father, who was a government servant, allowed me to go on my first cricket tour in 1962 only because the Maharaja of Mysore intervened and promised him I would complete my degree on my return,’ he recalls.

Prasanna’s off-spinning rival was Chennai’s Srinivas Venkataraghavan, another engineering graduate. Venkat fitted in with the stereotype of the stoic, unsmiling Tamil Brahmin and was a strict disciplinarian. I once met him at the Madras Cricket Club where he admonished a group of teenagers at the adjoining table for speaking too loudly. ‘He was the professor, the intellectual amongst us bon vivants. We would be having a drink and he would be reading a book,’ says Bedi. Venkat was more than just a spinner, though; unlike the others, he was a decent batsman and a fine close-in fielder who would later even go on to become an international umpire.

The final maestro making up this incredible foursome was also the most enigmatic and fascinating. Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, another Kannadiga, was a truly heroic figure. An attack of polio at a very young age had withered his right arm but that did not stop him from becoming, arguably, the greatest match-winning bowler in Indian cricket history. He was unconventional in every sense; he would take a long run-up for a spinner and bowl leg-spinning deliveries with a pace and variety that foxed the best players. The sight of Chandrasekhar with the ball, marking his run-up, was enough for an entire stadium in Mumbai or Kolkata to shout in unison, ‘Boowwlled’. The sound would echo with a frenzy that would leave overseas batsmen shaken even before they played a ball.

When Chandrasekhar wasn’t playing cricket, he liked to be far away from the action, quietly listening to a song by Mukesh or Saigal. ‘If you wanted to find Chandra before a Test match in Mumbai, he would be in Mukesh’s house for a private music concert,’ recalls Bedi. Even now, Chandrasekhar prefers to be a recluse, refusing to carry a mobile – or at least choosing not to share the number! – and spending a lot of his time with his son in the US.

I ask Syed Kirmani, arguably the finest Indian wicketkeeper who played a fair bit with the four spinners, to compare them. ‘Champions, all of them,’ he says. ‘Chandra was a genius and keeping to him was the biggest challenge. He could bowl leg-spin, googlies and top-spinners with almost the same action. And his faster one had the speed of a fast bowler. I remember he bowled a bouncer to Viv Richards once that went past the great batsman’s nose. Viv turned around and asked me, “Is this guy bowling spin or is he Jeff Thomson [the fastest bowler in the world in the 1970s]!”’

Continues Kirmani, ‘Prasanna was a wily fox who would defeat you in the air. His loop was such as if he was holding the ball on a string like a puppet-master. Venkat was not in the same league, he was flatter with his deliveries but very exact and determined. And Bedi was simply poetry in action. He could bowl six different deliveries in an over, including an armer, with the most effortless style. When you watched him bowl, you felt as if you were in a museum in the presence of a great artist.’

Why did India become the land of spinners while neighbouring Pakistan produced fast bowlers? The conventional explanation is the differing physical attributes of the two South Asian neighbours. The tall and muscular Pakistanis were seen to possess the physique to bowl fast while the less well-built Indians were more adept at bowling spin. I offer a slight variation to the theory. In India, cricket was an elite and urban middle-class sport till Kapil Dev’s team won the 1983 World Cup and opened up the sport to a new generation. The Indian team was mostly full of players belonging to the Brahminical upper castes who perhaps considered fast bowling hard labour, especially in hot weather with unforgiving pitches. It is no surprise that three of the four spinning greats were urban Brahmins and mostly vegetarian with the Jat Sikh Bedi the only exception. The image of the Brahmin as more learned and less physical fits in with the idea of spin bowling as an art form where mind scores over muscle. When I suggest this to Prasanna, he laughs. ‘We were vegetarian in our food habits, but strictly non-vegetarian when we were gobbling up opposing batsmen!’

Between them, the spin quartet picked up an astonishing 853 Test wickets. By contrast, the great West Indian fast bowling equivalent of Andy Roberts, Joel Garner, Michael Holding and Colin Croft put together had 835 wickets. Of the 98 Test matches in which one or more of the spinners played together, India won 23, lost 36 and drew 39 games. If those aren’t striking figures, let’s put them in context – India won only 7 out of 76 Tests till the arrival of the spinners. ‘I think they changed the way we played the game. Until the spinners came, our main aim was not to lose the match. Now we could think of actually trying to win games,’ explains former India captain Ajit Wadekar.

Wadekar should know. He was the captain of the team that scored a hat-trick of victories over the West Indies and England between 1970 and 1973, wins that catapulted Indian cricket on to the world stage. The finest performance was probably at the Oval in London in 1971 when India defeated England on its home turf for the first time. This is how my late father Dilip Sardesai remembers the game. ‘The wicket was turning when Wadekar brought Chandra on to bowl. Chandra and I had gone to the horse races on the rest day of the match. A horse called Mildred won a race. When John Edrich came to bat, I told Chandra: “Isko Mildred daal [bowl him a Mildred].” He bowled the most vicious googly and shattered the stumps. After that, Chandra was unplayable and the English batsmen were psychologically destroyed. When we won the game the next day, it seemed as if every Indian living in England was at the Oval. One of them offered us free food and drink for life in his restaurant and named dishes after us!’

On that August day at the Oval in 1971, Indian cricket had tasted real freedom. Just months later, India would go to war with Pakistan and liberate Bangladesh in a decisive military triumph that renewed the country’s self-confidence, earlier dented by the defeat in the 1962 Sino-Indian war. Chandrasekhar picked up 6 wickets, Venkat 2 and Bedi 1. The mantra of non-violence as defined by spin had won the day for the Indians yet again.

The match-winning performances would continue for at least another seven years till the fingers and arms began to tire. The great Indian spin quartet was conquered on the first tour to Pakistan in 1978. The host team’s batting, led by Zaheer Abbas and Javed Miandad, was in prime form on flat batting tracks and the ageing Indian bowling attack just couldn’t match up. The spinners would be quickly pushed into retirement. ‘It happened a little suddenly and was unfortunate but we had a bloody good ride along the way,’ Prasanna reflects on the endgame.

England would be the venue of Bedi’s final series in 1979. He was only thirty-three when he played his last Test, a relatively young age for a spinner. But no one had bowled more overs through the 1970s than the sardar from Amritsar. No one had taken more wickets for India when he retired: 266 wickets in 67 Tests. Only two left-arm spinners, Derek Underwood of England and Daniel Vettori of New Zealand, have taken more Test wickets. But no one has brought more joy to the cricket purist; when Bedi came in to bowl in his resplendent blue or pink patka, you couldn’t help but be transfixed by his action, smooth and rich as the milk in his hometown. The English off-spinner Jim Laker once said that his idea of heaven was ‘sunshine at Lord’s, Ray Lindwall, the Australian fast bowler, bowling from one end, Bedi from the other’.

His critics say Bedi bowled like a millionaire, often giving away too many runs in his search for wickets. This is statistically untrue; Bedi is second best to the West Indian Lance Gibbs in terms of bowling maiden overs per Test match. Bedi explains his approach of clapping after being hit for six. ‘You bowl to get a batsman out. If a Test batsman hits a few fours or sixes but I get him out for 30, isn’t it better than bowling defensively and allowing him to just bat on and on and score a hundred?’ The attacking instinct played a bit part in Bedi’s prominent role in India’s first-ever overseas wins in Australia, West Indies, England and New Zealand.

Sir Don Bradman suggests that Bedi is among the greatest left- arm spinners of all time. In a fitting tribute, Bradman writes, ‘Bedi was a real study for the connoisseur. His ideal well-balanced run-up always brought him into the perfect delivery position. The ball was held well in the tips of long, almost delicate fingers which never seemed to get tired, but always retained great flexibility and control. There were regular but very subtle changes of pace – variations in flight, and always coupled with genuine spin. The end product was a delight to watch and I do not hesitate to rank Bedi among the finest bowlers of his type we have seen.’

No Indian cricketer had received higher praise from cricket’s ultimate icon. But Bedi’s true impact on Indian cricket lies not just in his contribution to the art of left-arm spin bowling but in the way he redefined the idea of leadership in Indian sport by putting player power above personal success."

Walking as Political Tool in Contemporary India,https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/walking-as-political-tool-in-contemporary-india,"Oct 23, 2023  |  Ravi Kumar","Three instances of walking grabbed attention in the recent past. First, when farmers marched under the leadership of All India Kisan Sabha in Maharashtra in 2018; second, when they marched from different parts of the country towards the Delhi border in 2020; and lastly, Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2022.

In all three cases, leaders and masses walked hundreds and thousands of miles across the length and breadth of the country. Let us understand the way walking gets employed as a political instrument with contemporary examples.

We walk everyday and our socio-economic and cultural context determines the nature of our walking – from a worker walking to their workplace, trying to make ends meet, to the relatively better off population walking to take care of their life-style diseases. They do not grab our attention the way the farmers or Rahul did. Attention was due to the political noise it was making.

Walking as a political project had ceased to be part of political imagination except in cases of parties organising marches in a few states. That is why the Maharashtra farmers’ march and Bharat Jodo Yatra stand out.

In the current political climate, walking as a political project is new, abnormal and under-explored. Primary reason being the political illusion of ‘reaching’ people online understood as ‘knowing’ people and the society in actuality.

Images posted on online forums and the likes collected – representing their pains, angst and anxieties – killed the significance of physical connection. Secondly, the dominant politics constructs a self-image that being physically distant from people implies being more powerful. The more inaccessible the leader is, the more powerful he is assumed to be. Hence, the political leadership develops a host of paraphernalia to limit access. There is celebration of being distant from the masses in physical form.

Walking as a political tool

It was not always like this. Irrespective of political agreements and disagreements within the Congress leadership, we saw how Nehru had no qualms mixing with the masses, Indira Gandhi lessened it, and then Rajiv Gandhi was killed as he was nonchalant about physical meetings.

Thereafter, there was a lull within the party as the leaders began to physically distance themselves from the masses. This happened simultaneously with the disappearance of mass mobilisation as a tool of politics within the party.

Nehru emerged from a history of anti-colonial struggle and mobilisations which defined his relationship of physical contact with masses. This historical characterisation of subsequent Gandhi family leaders was much less in comparison and hence, their physical relationship with the masses decreased.

The party emerging as a powerful political force post-independence was a result of mass mobilisation with the Nehru-Gandhi family at its centre. That memory of connection with the masses lingered on for a few decades. The disconnect with the masses happened as the necessity of addressing newly emerging political necessities were ignored.

As political agency of the marginalised caste groups began knocking at the doors of established political forces, parties such as the Congress, due to the entrenched Brahmanical interests, lagged in responding to the issues at an organisational level.

One reason was that they paid less attention to the evolving turmoil in the social and economic order on the ground as the political nostalgia of the freedom struggle and the Nehruvian years were thought sufficient for electoral gains.

Challenges appeared in different regions from the emerging movements and identitarian assertion on the ground. And the Congress party did not have an organisational structure with an inclusive, non-patronising framework. This began weakening the political strength of the Congress.

When Rahul arrived on the scene, the disjunct between the actuality and projections in the virtual sphere had already created an illusion unheard of. This disjunct hid the actuality – the exploitation, marginalisation, deprivation, violence, hunger and death as experienced by people on the ground. Absence of a robust cadre-based organisation, which right-wing politics has, implied that the leadership had to give a call.

After a long time, Rahul has decided to plunge himself in the political format that congress leaders of pre-independence India practiced. He is trying to imbibe the mode of being a mass leader which is unlike any other political leader at the moment. His recent political activities have been efforts at establishing that democracy (even in its liberal format) is about the relationship between political parties, the masses and the state as their representatives. He is reimagining an idea of state-people relationship as an alternative to whatever has transpired in the past few decades. This relationship is more than mere voting but it is about listening to the masses, understanding their feelings first hand and expressing solidarity with them.

Spectacularity as a substitute of conversationality

We have a history replete with people who walked and learned the lessons of life and politics – from Gautam Buddha, Guru Nanak to Mahatma Gandhi and Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan among many others.

That history has been delegitimised by the contemporary politicians who attend five meetings on the same day in different parts of the country using sponsored modes of transport. Walking as a mode of politics has been virtually ignored. Walking brings freedom; it liberates one from all that is ongoing, it separates you from the narcissism and the comforts of the echo-chamber, prompts you to think afresh and provides fodder to reflect anew.

In this sense, walking is also about meeting people and being alone and contemplating, all at the same time. By walking one surrender’s one’s own identity and meets people from different quarters of life where the privileges bestowed by your identity do not infringe upon your life.

The hegemonic forces have created an illusory reality through virtual presence. Across organisations chief ministers have their faces everywhere – from toilets, sewage cleaning machines, newspapers, hoardings to buses and rickshaws.

This phenomenon picked up as political leadership decided to fill the minds of people with their own personal images. The photograph of the leader represents the politics rather than the content of politics. Therefore, the emphasis is to construct the image.

This further contributes to distancing of politics from the masses and an inflated sense of self in political leaders seeing themselves everywhere. In such a situation, detachment becomes a necessity to think clearly.

Detachment from the virtual world

The political habitat comprises paraphernalia of different kinds – from cameras surrounding you at all times to a possibly sanitised space. This constrains the physical and, therefore, mental movement of the politician. When Gandhi and Nehru and the farmers walked, they were unconstrained. Today the politicians walk on cleanly lined carpers at temples and even in remote places in the Himalayas. They are welcomed by a set of people they already know and who speak predetermined dialogues. Masses are cordoned off to inaccessibly far off places in a public meeting and even those who shower petals are recruited and trained. It’s a world of lies and illusion.

In the recent past, mainstream political leaders have seldom walked across the length and breadth of their own electoral constituency, let alone the rest of the country. Riding on the technical crutches of social media they don’t even meet their voters.

There are people who haven’t met either municipality, assembly or parliamentary candidates of their area. The distance between the leader and the masses has been increasing, filled through intermediaries of technology.

There has been an impersonalisation of politics, democracy being redefined. Prime ministers, chief ministers do roadshows. The roadshows are instruments of spectacularity. In a time when masses are being served a larger than life image of politicians, the roadshows are mere attempts at shortcutting the processes of democracy – a glimpse of who they elect instead of a conversation or touch. This process alienates masses from politics and takes away the dialogic relationship between the masses and politicians. In the long run this results in a disconnect of political forces with the real issues, needs and aspirations of the masses.

In a sanitised stage the political persona is bereft of human interface. It gets alienated from the public, from the realities of its constituents. To take care of the consequent chasm between the political persona and the masses, spectacularisation of political relationships is employed. Politics is transformed into a spectacle and so is the body and the self of the politician. This gets expressed through images – still as well as moving.

Hence, the full control over agencies that transmit images is intended and undertaken. French philosopher Guy Debord tells us that “the images detached from every aspect of life merge into a common stream in which the unity of that life can no longer be recovered. Fragmented views of reality regroup themselves into a new unity as a separate pseudo-world that can only be looked at. The specialisation of images of the world evolves into a world of autonomised images where even the deceivers are deceived. The spectacle is a concrete inversion of life, an autonomous movement of the non-living”.

Increasing absence of control over social media, generally employed to take care of the above mentioned chasm, often gets employed against the producers of those memes and messages themselves. Only a political counter-narrative that brings people in flesh and blood to the centre of politics can deal with this spectacularisation. There can be different kinds of counter-narratives depending on how the material conditions are understood and the kind of politics that is imagined to transform those material conditions. Rahul’s recent initiatives can be seen as a move in that direction.

Walking to what end?

What does Rahul seek to attain through his marches and through walks within villages and in fields? No doubt, it can be debated that these actions are embedded in the consumptive framework of a certain kind, as it gets edited and then presented to viewers while simultaneously providing an unedited, raw version as well.

The act of walking through villages, on non-sanitised, non-carpeted streets, roads and temple paths is counter-positioning of an alternative politics to the current narrative of sanitised, carpeted and well-scripted mingling with masses. How far will this narrative embed all this in the politico-economic and materiality of societies is a separate question.

When Rahul spends time with different kinds of people, he extricates himself out of the superficiality of the discourse woven by the social media and interacts with the actual people in flesh and blood, reflecting on their conditions and conversations he had with them. This walk liberates one from the repetition of images generated within the confines of the city and the ecosystem created by the hegemonic powers. That ecosystem of constantly thinking that tweeting-means-meeting-people is breached, new images get built, which might produce a completely different political persona and a politics.

In this situation, the significance of undoing the sanitised sphere of politics becomes significant. It acquires the status of a counter-agenda, as a necessity that claims to disturb the autocracy of the sanitised and spectacularised space that the right-wing neoliberal politics creates.

Jaishankar Hopes India Can Resume Visa Operations in Canada ‘Very Soon’,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/external-affairs-minister-jaishankar-hopes-india-can-resume-visa-services-in-canada-very-soon,"Oct 22, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: One month after halting visa operations in Canada, India is currently reviewing the “security situation” around India’s missions in Canada, and external affairs minister S. Jaishankar has indicated that if there is substantial “progress” in ensuring the safety of Indian diplomats, the resumption of operations could occur “very soon”.

Last Thursday, Canada announced that it had withdrawn 41 diplomats from India and stopped in-person facilities for Indian nationals at three consulates.

Ottawa had stated that visa processing times for Indian applicants would increase.

Canadian foreign minister Mélanie Joly had also accused India of violating the 1961 Vienna Convention for Diplomatic Relations (VCDR) by threatening to strip diplomatic immunity from all but 21 diplomats.

India had retorted that seeking the implementation of “parity” was within the scope of VCDR.

The United States and the United Kingdom also issued statements on Friday claiming that the insistence on the 41 diplomats’ withdrawal was not in line with obligations under the Vienna convention.

India had not officially responded to the UK and US’ statements, but Jaishankar said that the “big concern” was the suspension of visa services by the Indian high commission and two consulates in Canada.

“Some weeks ago, we stopped issuing visas in Canada because it was no longer safe for our diplomats to go to work to issue visas. So their safety and security was the primary reason we had to temporarily stop the issue of visas,” he said on Sunday at an interaction.

India had stopped visa operations after Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau had accused Indian government agents of being involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian national who is described as a terrorist by authorities in New Delhi.

Watch: Has Jaishankar Been Able to Influence the US Response to the India-Canada Crisis?

This Indian move was in addition to the expulsion of a Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat measure. At the same time, India had also sought “parity” in diplomatic representation in both countries.

On September 21, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said that India will “continue to review this situation on a regular basis” and that the assessment on the security environment for Indian diplomats “will be going on”.

Now, Jaishankar for the first time publicly indicated that a review was underway.

“We’re tracking it very closely. My hope, my expectation, is that [the] situation would improve in the sense that our people would have greater confidence in being able to do their basic duty as diplomats,” Jaishankar said.

He continued: “Because ensuring [the] safety and security of diplomats is the most fundamental aspect of the Vienna Convention. And right now, that is what has in many ways been challenged in Canada, that our people are not safe, our diplomats are not safe.

“So if we see progress there, I would like very much to resume the issue of visas. My hope would be that it would be something which should happen very soon…”

Indian official sources further reinforced the minister’s messaging that indicated that an imminent decision was in the wings by highlighting Jaishankar’s remarks that India was “reviewing the security situation that led to the suspension of visa services”.

Jaishankar also defended India’s insistence on parity with Canada’s diplomatic strength.

“We invoked parity because we had concerns about continuous interference in our affairs by Canadian personnel. We haven’t made much of that public. My sense is that over a period of time, more stuff will come out and people will understand why we had the kind of discomfort with many of them which we did,” he said.

A substantial section of the Canadian population is of Indian origin and has been deeply worried about the resumption of Indian visa operations, with most of them not having overseas citizen of India cards.

The Canadian decision to suspend ‘walk-in’ services at consulates and the drastic cutting down of immigration officials in India meant that there would be a large backlog in processing applications.

As per Canadian media reports, 45% of Canada’s international students, 27% of new permanent residents and 22% of temporary foreign workers come from India."

New Delhi: India sent medical and disaster relief aid for Palestinians on Sunday (October 22).

External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi announced on X (formerly Twitter) that an Indian Air Force C-17 flight carrying nearly 6.5 tonnes of medical aid and 32 tonnes of disaster relief material departed for the El-Arish airport in Egypt.

“The material includes essential life-saving medicines, surgical items, tents, sleeping bags, tarpaulins, sanitary utilities, [and] water purification tablets among other necessary items,” Bagchi’s post said.

El-Arish airport is roughly 45 kilometres away from the Rafah crossing on Egypt’s border with the Gaza strip.

Rafah is currently the only crossing point for humanitarian aid into Gaza.

But the crossing has not been fully operational since the war between Israel and Hamas began.

The BBC cited Egyptian media as saying that Israeli air strikes were causing disruptions near the crossing.

International aid to Palestine has remained in warehouses in El-Arish, but negotiations involving Israel, Egypt, the US and the UN resulted in the Rafah crossing opening on Saturday (October 21).

A convoy including 20 aid trucks entered Gaza following the crossing’s opening, Al Jazeera reported.

India supports Palestine and Palestinian refugees through contributions to the UN’s relief and works agency (UNRWA).

It has contributed a total of $36.5 million to the UNRWA between 2002 and 2022-23, the external affairs ministry said in a brief dated May this year.

Bagchi said on behalf of the ministry earlier this month that India has “always advocated the resumption of direct negotiations towards establishing a sovereign, independent, and viable state of Palestine”.

This includes Palestine “living within secure and recognised borders side by side at peace with Israel”.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas last week and “reiterated India’s long-standing and principled position on the Israel-Palestine issue”.

He has also spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and expressed solidarity with Israel.

“People of India firmly stand with Israel in this difficult hour. India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” a post from Modi’s X account said.

Within India, students from Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh Muslim University were booked for taking out a march in support of Palestine without permission, the Indian Express reported.

They were booked under IPC sections related to promoting enmity among different groups, disobedience to orders promulgated by a public servant and statements conducting to public mischief.

Authorities in Kashmir also barred Srinagar residents from offering Friday prayers at the city’s Jamia Masjid due to fears regarding protests over the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine.

An Uttar Pradesh official told the Express that chief minister Adityanath said that “any activity contrary to the views of [the] government of India would not be accepted on this issue [the Israel-Hamas war]”.

Al Jazeera reported that a lot of disinformation on social media targeting Palestinians since the Israel-Hamas war began had come from right-wing accounts based in India.

Starting with a surprise strike on Israel by Hamas – a socio-political and military organisation that rules the Gaza Strip – on October 7, the Israel-Hamas war has so far claimed the lives of 1,400 Israelis and 4,137 Palestinians.

Hamas also captured more than 200 people as hostages after the initial assault. Two of the hostages were released on Friday.

On Sunday (October 22), Israel carried out an air strike in Jenin, saying that Hamas was using a mosque as a “terrorist compound”, the BBC reported.

Jenin is located in the West Bank, which has the other Palestinian territories in the region and is ruled by Hamas’s rival Fatah."
"EPFO Data: With 13.3% Dip in New Monthly Subscribers, Formal Job Creation Slowed in August",https://m.thewire.in/article/labour/epfo-data-with-13-3-dip-in-new-monthly-subscribers-formal-job-creation-slowed-in-august,"Oct 21, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: In August, formal job creation slowed, indicating a downward slide in the labour markets. As per the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), the number of new monthly subscribers declined by 13.3% in August in comparison to July. In absolute numbers, new monthly subscribers decreased from 1.06 million in July to 9,25, 984 in August.

The latest payroll data released by EPFO on Friday, October 20, also revealed that the share of women also decreased from 26.7% (2,85, 424) in July to 26.3% (2,43,510). However, the share of young subscribers, in the age group of 18-28, shot up marginally from 67.97% (7,26,415) in July to 68.3% (6,32,331) in August, Business Standard reported.

The EPFO payroll data helps to track employment creation in the formal sector, as it is mandatory for every new employee to sign up for provident fund under the EPFO. The National Statistical Office (NSO) also uses EPFO data to analyse employment trends in the country.

On the other hand, the net payroll addition also went up marginally by 0.8% to 1.69 million in August from July 1.68 million. The net payroll is calculated by considering the number of new subscribers, the number of exits, and the return of old subscribers.

It should be noted that net monthly payroll numbers are provisional in nature and are revised sharply the following month. Therefore, the number of new EPF subscribers holds more significance than net additions.

Rituparna Chakraborty of TeamLease Services said the momentum found in the labour market at the beginning of the financial year, which generally prepares a holistic view of their workforce requirement, lost momentum by monsoon time as more people took to work in the agriculture sector, Business Standard reported.

Chakraborty continued to add that with the onset of the festive season, the momentum could be picked up due to expected demand in retail and consumption sectors, resulting in the creation of new formal jobs.

According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), the unemployment in the country in August rose to 8.1% from 7.9% in July coupled with a situation where there had been increased labour force participation and the economy was not able to create jobs proportionately."
Drones Give New Dimensions to Narcoterrorism at the India-Pakistan Border,https://m.thewire.in/article/south-asia/drones-give-new-dimensions-to-narcoterrorism-at-the-india-pakistan-border,"Oct 21, 2023  |  Vaishali Basu Sharma","This piece was first published on The India Cable – a premium newsletter from The Wire & Galileo Ideas – and has been republished here.

On October 11, Punjab Police arrested Jaswinder Singh, Lovepreet Singh, and Gurpartap Singh from Ajnala, Amritsar, for planning targeted killings in the state. The accused, from whom the police seized two pistols, three magazines and 11 bullets, had connections with Harvinder Singh alias Rinda, a designated terrorist and a member of the Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), based in Pakistan. The group had received a weapons consignment from Pakistan and aimed to target political and socio-religious leaders in India.

This is not an isolated case. Last month, Punjab Police detected the financial trail of three modules which were sending over Rs 2 crore in drug money on a daily basis to smugglers based in Pakistan and Afghanistan via an extensive hawala network.

Interstate conflict has many dimensions. In the Indian context, the scope of gangsters has evolved by way of extensive criminal networks, across traditional geographic boundaries and their technological utilisation, thus posing a substantial challenge that coalesces organised crime, gang activity, narco-trafficking, and terror orchestration. Apart from narcotics, cross-border consignments have been found to include hand grenades, RDX IEDs, pistols, magazines, cartridges, and cash ― explicit evidence that these criminal cartels are receiving state backing.

Exactly a year ago, the Punjab Police had recovered “an RDX-loaded tiffin box fabricated into an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) or tiffin bomb, two sophisticated AK-56 assault rifles along with two magazines and 30 live cartridges, one .30 bore pistol and 2 kgs heroin.” Upon interrogation, the module it was recovered from admitted to receiving backing from Pakistan-based entities. In May 2022, an IED packed with RDX in a metallic box weighing over 2.5 kg, prepared in Pakistan, was recovered from two men who admitted that they were carrying out terror activities for money and drugs.

Running international smuggling operations interested in acquiring advanced weapon technologies and readily excited about violence over Khalistan, gangsters in Punjab have been easily galvanised by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). From targeting government infrastructure to killing influential civilians whom they perceive to be working with law enforcement, these gangsters have engaged in terrorist activities with the purpose of weakening the administrative system and engaging in blatantly anti-national activities.

Escalated drone sightings along the India-Pakistan border

Along the US-Mexican border, cases of drug trafficking cartels moving narcotics via unmanned aerial systems (UASs or drones) are plenteous. The method had also caught on along the India-Pakistan international border.

But lately, there has been a distinct escalation of drone-assisted cross-border delivery of drugs and weapons along the northern border areas. Since 2020, such drone deliveries have increased fourfold. On October 12, the Border Security Force (BSF), in a joint search operation with the police, captured a drone carrying 3.213 kg payload on the outskirts of Daliri Village in Tarn Taran District. Drone intrusions occur almost every day in border areas of Punjab ― Fazilka, Ferozepur, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, and Gurdaspur. This month, until October 14, there were four separate drone sightings.

The drone operations are orchestrated by Pakistan-based associates, and the drones are of Chinese origin, most commonly the DJI Matrice 300 RTK, DJI Matrix 350 RTK or DJI Mavic 3 classic variants. The Matrix is a ‘next-generation drone’ with a live video transmission system visible from as far as 20 km, an ‘efficient battery’ for 55 minutes of flying time and ‘robust’ compatibility to carry four payloads at once, with 10 kg of additional payload capacity. The batteries are rechargeable up to 400 cycles. The flight data of captured drones reveals that they had not only been operational within Pakistan but had also flown in China. The embedded chip in the drones contained coordinates that pointed to their airborne presence in Chinese territory and subsequently in Khanewal, in Punjab province of Pakistan.

The utilisation of high-calibre drones in the cross-border delivery of weapons and narcotics for anti-India activities is beyond the capacity of criminal gangs, and is happening with active state sponsorship. The influx of narcotics and the cash from their sale, along with weapon deliveries, has resulted in a virulent hybridisation of the illicit drug trade, weapons trafficking, terrorism and assassinations.

Last month, local Congress leader Baljinder Singh Balli was shot at his house in Dala Village in Moga District, for which Canada-based gangster-turned-terrorist Arshdeep Singh Gill (alias Arsh Dala) claimed responsibility via Facebook. In 2020, Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu was gunned down at the behest of Pakistan-based Khalistani terrorist Lakhbir Singh Rode.

Gangster and terrorist Lakhbir Singh ‘Landa’ faces charges of smuggling drugs, arms and explosives from across the border, using drones. Wanted for several targeted killings in Punjab, Landa and his Czech Republic-based associate Gurdev Singh Jaisel, organised RPG attacks at the Sarhali Kalan police station and the Punjab Police’s intelligence headquarters in Mohali on May 9. Landa received consignments of firearms, IEDs and AK47 rifles from across the border. In the past year, Sarhali Police Station in Punjab’s Tarn Taran has been attacked more than half a dozen times, and other police and Army establishments have been struck.

Aside from strengthening Village Defence Committees (VDCs) and rewarding those who have helped curb narcotics smuggling, the Punjab Police plan to use Artificial Intelligence to counter drone and narcotics threats in border areas. Drone Emergency Response System (DERS) has been launched in sections of the border, but it is not foolproof and more comprehensive, proactive and collaborative countermeasures are required.

It is conventionally understood that drug trafficking organisations and terrorist groups are linked, but contemporarily, this linkage has found new ground in India through backing from Pakistan. With increasing cases of ‘gangsters’ targeting police stations and undertaking political assassinations, the lines distinguishing gangsters and terrorists have blurred. The massive narcotics push into India, in addition to being a challenge to the solvency of the state, has begun to affect the moral fabric of society by creating a drug addiction epidemic in border states.

"Departure of Canadian Diplomats: US, UK Back Canada, Accuse India of Violating Vienna Convention",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/canada-diplomats-us-united-kingdom-canada-vienna-convention,"Oct 21, 2023  |  Devirupa Mitra","New Delhi: Backing Ottawa, the United States and the United Kingdom have expressed concern that India’s “unilateral” move to diplomatic immunity and privileges from 41 diplomats was a violation of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, disagreeing with New Delhi’s contention that it was in line with international law.

Canada had announced on October 19 that it was withdrawing 41 diplomats, leaving only 21 on the ground in India. The Canadian foreign minister Mélanie Joly said that India’s threat to remove diplomatic privileges from all but 21 Canadian diplomats was “contrary to international law, including the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations”.

India had sought “parity” in diplomatic strength in the two countries after relations went into crisis following Canada’s Prime Minister Justine Trudeau’s accusation that New Delhi was behind the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian national and pro-Khalistan supporter.

Both countries had expelled one diplomat each in a tit-for-tat measure. An angry India, which termed the allegations as “absurd”, also stopped all visa services in Canada and asked the north American nation to reduce its diplomatic strength to be in line with India’s numbers.

A day before the second deadline of October 20, Canada repatriated the majority of its diplomats from India. “I can confirm that the diplomatic status of the 41 Canadian diplomats who have left India has been revoked as of today, October 20, 2023,” Emily Williams, spokesperson for Canadian foreign minister Joly said on Friday, as quoted by The Globe and Mail.

India had responded through a press release that its actions “implementing this parity (in diplomatic strength) are fully consistent with Article 11.1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations”.

Later on the night of October 20, Indian official sources further buttressed this stance, insisting that it was not only in line with VCDR, but also Canada’s domestic legislation.

But New Delhi’s defence didn’t cut much ice in Washington and London, both partners of the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence network with Canada.

‘Have urged India’

US state department spokesperson Mathew Miller said that Washington was “concerned” at the departure of Canadian diplomats “in response to the Indian government’s demand of Canada to significantly reduce its diplomatic presence in India”.

“Resolving differences requires diplomats on the ground. We have urged the Indian government not to insist upon a reduction in Canada’s diplomatic presence and to cooperate in the ongoing Canadian investigation,” he said.

Furthermore, Miller stated that the US “expect[s] India to uphold its obligations under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, including with respect to privileges and immunities enjoyed by accredited members of Canada’s diplomatic mission”.

‘Unilateral move’

The UK foreign office stated it did “not agree with the decisions taken by the Indian government that have resulted in a number of Canadian diplomats departing India”.

The British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office bluntly said that “the unilateral removal of the privileges and immunities that provide for the safety and security of diplomats is not consistent with the principles or the effective functioning of the Vienna Convention”.

The statement noted that all states were expected to “uphold their obligations under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations”.

Moreover, UK reiterated that India should “engage with Canada on its independent investigation into the death of Hardeep Singh Nijjar”.

‘Contravene a very fundamental principle’

After the foreign minister, the Canadian prime minister accused India of violating a cornerstone of international diplomacy, which he said should be a matter of concern for the whole world

“This is them choosing to contravene a very fundamental principle of international law and diplomacy. It is something that all countries in the world should be very worried about,” Trudeau told reporters in Brampton, Canada, on Saturday, October 21.

He also stated that India’s demand for parity has hurt Indo-Canadians and Indians wanting to study or work in Canada.

“The Indian government is making it unbelievably difficult for life as usual to continue for millions of people in India and in Canada,” he said.

He also stated that what New Delhi has done “has me very concerned for the well-being and happiness of millions of Canadians who trace their origins to the Indian subcontinent.”

OCI demand upsurge

A report by CBC news stated that there was an upsurge in demand for the Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) card, with Indian-origin Canadians camping around the clock outside the OCI office in Brampton to be able to submit their applications.

This is the only service that India has not suspended after all other operations were suspended for Canadian nationals. With an OCI card, a foreign national can visit and stay in India as long as they want.

The Canadian decision to stop in-person services at the three consulates will certainly impact thousands of Indians, with officials in Canada estimating that it will lead to a backlog of 17,500 applications.

Late on Friday night, Indian officials had claimed India had only sought parity between the two main missions in Ottawa and New Delhi and not in the three consulates. They described that the Canadian move as “unilateral and not related to implementation of parity”."
"SC Objects to CBI Terming itself 'Republic of India' in Pleas, Reminds Agency of its Mandate",https://m.thewire.in/article/law/sc-objects-to-cbi-terming-itself-republic-of-india-in-pleas-reminds-agency-of-its-mandate,"Oct 21, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday, October 20, came down heavily on the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for filing its petitions and submissions to the court as “Republic of India”.

“Why have you filed as the ‘Republic of India’? You are not representing the Union or the Republic. You don’t represent the Union of India? You cannot file your petitions like that,” Hindustan Times quoted a division Bench of Justice A.S. Oka and Justice Pankaj Mithal as saying

The court reminded the CBI that its mandate under the law is to probe illegalities of both Union and state governments an independent agency.

After the remarks, the Bench ordered the cause-title of the case be altered by the court registry, omitting the words ‘Republic of India’. Additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati agreed with the court’s directive.

It is pertinent to recall that in November 2021, the West Bengal government moved the Supreme Court questioning the CBI’s jurisdiction to register first information reports (FIRs) and conduct investigations in states. Instead of making CBI, an autonomous agency, a party to the case, the West Bengal government made the Union government a party. The Union government then said that it has no power over the exercise of authority by an autonomous body like the CBI.

However, information from the Supreme Court website reveals that there are a number of cases where the CBI represented itself as the ‘Republic of India’ and not as ‘CBI’, HT report said.

The hearing in question pertains to CBI’s appeal against bail granted to Subhra Kundu, a former actress and the wife of Gautam Kundu who runs a chit-fund company called Rose Valley. The company is accused of a multi-crore scam which is currently under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

Pegged at Rs 17,000 crore, the alleged scam is the biggest in the history of West Bengal. The Supreme Court had in 2014 ordered the CBI to investigate the role of influential people involved in money laundering in the state. According to the probe agency, the chit-fund group had established 27 companies, of which only 12 were active. The group is accused of hoodwinking gullible investors by promising inflated returns on their investments between 8% and 27%. Investigation is currently underway in both West Bengal and Odisha.

The Odisha high court in August 2022 granted bail to Subhra Kundu, which is being challenged by the CBI in the top court."
Elation and Disappointment: The Story of Bengal's Durga Puja Economy,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/elation-and-disappointment-the-story-of-bengals-durga-puja-economy,"Oct 21, 2023  |  Joydeep Sarkar","Kolkata: As Bengal’s Durga Puja kicks off in earnest today, it is time to recognise that along with being a cultural extravaganza, it is an economic powerhouse in its own right. The festival brings together diverse communities and, in the process, fosters a financial ecosystem that involves transactions of significant amount across the state.

In the weeks preceding each Puja, the traditional shopping destinations such as Hatibagan, Gariahat, and New Market in Kolkata extend their operating hours well into the night. Last week, the Kolkata Police had to shut a vital thoroughfare to vehicular traffic to contain the pre-Puja shopping rush.

In Kolkata’s Dharmatala, Farhan Sheikh, a retailer of readymade garments said that uptick in business is largely due to the timing of people receiving their salary bonuses.

“This is the time when many government and non-government employees, as well as labourers, do their festive shopping. Our sales reached their peak during the last one week,” he says.

Ajay Gupta has been selling readymade clothes on the footpath of Gariahat in south Kolkata for the past 20 years. He says, “There was a time when people from both religions, Hindu and Muslim, used to kickstart their Puja shopping after August 15. The entire market revolved around the festival throughout the year. However, after 2014, the market experienced a series of setbacks, starting with the chit-fund scams, followed by the impact of COVID and subsequent lockdowns.”

The West Bengal chit fund scam, one of the largest Ponzi schemes in Indian history, continues to have a devastating impact on the lives of millions of people. An estimated 2 million investors, mostly from poor and lower middle-class backgrounds, lost over Rs 20,000 crores in it. Many investors lost their life savings and the reputation of the and its investment climate took a beating.

Gupta feels that the scams and the impact of the lockdowns might explain why the shopping picks up much later now.

At odds with the sellers on the footpath, the upmarket malls are upbeat. “Compared to last year, this year’s Puja market is thriving. We have seen an increase in footfall and sales. Our primary estimate suggests that the business in our malls has grown by 30% since last year,” said Ramesh Pandey, director at Ambuja Reality, who manages two malls in Kolkata.

Retail is widely understood to be the primary driving force behind financial activity during the Puja season, contributing to a chunk of the total business. For small-scale retailers though, the July fire at Malangala Hat, one of the largest garment markets in eastern India, dealt a severe blow. While the market has since reopened, a segment of retailers shifted towards direct business with Delhi and Surat, worsening the challenges faced by wholesalers.

But while Kolkata may have seen retail activity, the picture has been grim in handicrafts hubs across the state. At Shantipur and Fulia in Nadia district, the heart of the handloom industry in the state, declining product demand and insufficient government support plague artisans. Both regions have thousand-year-old heritages and both grapple with reduced product demand.

Somen Pal, a Shantipur businessman connected to the industry, says, “In our area, 57 handloom units have closed down since the lockdown in 2020. The traditional weaving community now confronts the threat of extinction, as weavers disassemble their looms en masse and seek migrant labour opportunities. The younger generation shows minimal interest in weaving, as they have discovered more financially rewarding prospects in other fields, where their hard work leads to significantly higher earnings compared to the modest returns from weaving.”

Economist Abhiroop Sarkar notes that the lockdown has two sides.

“One group faced a loss of income, while another group, driven by unmet demand, ventured into the market. Consequently, the market is on the path to becoming relatively prosperous, although not entirely restored to its previous economic conditions. Nonetheless, this shift has had an impact on those who lost their jobs or income,” Sarkar adds.

In 2019, a British Council study estimated the puja economy at approximately Rs 32,000 crore, contributing to 2.6% of the state domestic product. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has estimated the figure will reach Rs 60,000 crore this year.

In a state starved of jobs, this “Durga Puja economy” is the lifeline for thousands of families, serving as their primary source of income. From crafting intricate idols to illuminating the city and creating stunning designs, families across generations are heavily involved in the preparations. The Pujas’ essence thrives throughout the year.

In recent years, there has been a notable shift in the landscape of business operations, particularly with a marked increase in locally-owned businesses, predominantly led by women, owing to the influence of social media.

Just one year ago, Trinanka Poddar, fresh out of college, launched her handbag venture from her residence in Habra in the North 24 Parganas, with an initial investment of Rs 10,000. Leveraging social media platforms, she initially focused on a local customer base but gradually expanded her reach. Just ahead of the Puja season, Trinanka ventured into offline retail with the opening of her first physical store.

Similarly, Amrita Biswas, a resident of Nadia’s Badkulla, has been running a clothing business for the past six years from her home. This time, she has invested nearly Rs 8 lakhs to open her own store.

“In small towns, not everyone has a lot of money in hand. However, during the Puja season, it’s a must to buy new clothes, especially saris, so people are purchasing them. While sales happen throughout the year, Puja sales are particularly significant,” says Amrita.

CDS's Undiplomatic Talk of Russian 'Decline' Turns Focus on Weapon Procurement Challenges India May Face,https://m.thewire.in/article/security/cdss-undiplomatic-talk-of-russian-decline-turns-focus-on-weapon-procurement-challenges-india-may-face,"Oct 20, 2023  |  Rahul Bedi","Chandigarh: Should the Indian government take note of – and act upon – the geopolitical death knell of Russian power and influence that has been sounded publicly by its topmost soldier, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan? Or has the CDS spoken out of turn and been unduly alarmist, “peddling US propaganda” as one defence analyst has claimed? The question is not an academic one as Russia is still India’s principal materiel supplier and ‘decoupling’ is the essence of what the CDS seems to be saying.

Delivering the 14th Air Chief Marshal L.M. Katrememorial lecture in Bengaluru last weekend, General Chauhan declared that the geopolitical importance of Russia would decline in times to come, despite it being a nuclear power.

The Wagner rebellion, he said, referring to Moscow’s state-funded rogue private army, indicated Russia’s internal weakness and was indicative of what (adversity) may lie in store for its future, though he declined to elaborate on this point. The CDS further declared that, conversely, Beijing’s economic heft was now visible in the political, diplomatic and military domains and that the world would now see a more assertive China.

General Chauhan’s pessimistic and somewhat cynical public assessment regarding the future potential of a vital Indian ally and provider of 45% of the country’s defence equipment and over 40% of its oil imports, have been unfavourably received in official and diplomatic circles. Some media reports have asserted that this grouping is of the view that military personnel should not publicly make ‘inappropriate’ statements and should not be making prophecies that have a major bearing on foreign policy matters.

Earlier, for decades, clearance by the army’s Military Intelligence (MI) directorate was mandatory for all armed forces personnel before making any public statement – particularly adverse – with regard to any other country, including Pakistan, as this had the potential to affect bilateral ties. It is, however, not known whether in recent years this stipulation remains valid or, like numerous other military protocols, has been dispensed with, especially with regard to the CDS’s public declarations on diplomatic matters.

Whatever the propriety, General Chauhan was voicing beliefs prevalent within domestic military circles regarding Russia’s declining power status and influence, following its ongoing catastrophic war with Ukraine and the consequent sanctions this had invited from the United States and its allies. Even though Ukraine’s vaunted military offensive has not altered the reality of Russian occupation, the 20-month long war has effectively punctured the myth of Russian military indomitability and the competence of its varied platforms and equipment – a lot of which has proven operationally ineffective and inefficient on the battlefield.

Speaking to The Wire, a cross-section of serving and retired military officials privately doubted Moscow’s ability to maintain uninterrupted supplies of spares, components and sub-assemblies to India to sustain over 65% of in-service Russian equipment, and to deliver an assortment of platforms like air defence systems, frigates, a nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) and assault rifles, all of which are on order.

“Although the Ministry of Defence, the services and officials in Moscow continue to put on a brave front by claiming that there are no hitches in bilateral military commerce between the two sides, problems endure,” said a recently retired two-star Indian Army officer. These bottlenecks will continue to persist, and are likely to get worse, impinging negatively on our operational efficiency, he added, declining to be named given the sensitivity of the matter.

The Indian military’s dependency on Moscow continues to be overwhelming.

The bulk of the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) 29-30 fighter squadrons operate Russian platforms like 260-odd multi-role ‘Flanker’ Su-30MKIs fighters, 84 of which would, notably, be upgraded domestically to ‘Super Sukhoi’ standards by fitting them with 5th generation features and rendering them capable of delivering a heavier weapons load. The IAF also employs some 65 retrofitted ‘Fulcrum’ MiG-29UPG and around 55-60 ‘Fishbed’ MiG 21 ‘Bis’ ground attack combat aircraft, in addition to a large a large number of Russian military transports, mid-air refuellers and varied helicopters, all of which frequently need spares, without which they are simply inoperable.

Alongside, the Indian Navy’s (IN) principal warships are predominantly Russian in both origin and design. These include INS Vikramaditya (ex-Admiral Gorshkov), the retrofitted 44,500 tonne Kiev-class aircraft carrier and its combat air arm of 16 MiG-29K/KuB fighters. The force also has another 28 MiG-29Ks, some of which are expected to temporarily comprise the combat fleet of the newly commissioned indigenous aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant. The IN also deploys an assortment of Kamov ‘Helix’ Ka-28 and Ka-31 airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) rotary platforms.

The IN’s underwater platforms too included nine ‘Kilo’-class Type 877 diesel-electric submarines of a total of 16 such boats, while Russia had also provided the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) assistance in designing INS Arihant, the navy’s indigenously designed and built lead nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) that joined service in August 2016.

Russia is also providing technical know-how to miniaturise the 82.5MW reactor for the 4-5 follow-on SSBN’s presently under construction at the classified Ship Building Centre at Visakhapatnam. No other country is willing to make such strategic technology transfers to India, but industry sources indicated that sanctions and Russia’s own needs could ‘thwart’ Moscow’s ability to continue doing so, thereby imperilling the SSBN programme.

Furthermore, over 95% of the Indian Army’s fleet of around 3,000 main battle tanks (MBTs) operated by 67-odd armoured regiments were Russian T-72 and T-90S variants – imported directly and licence built – whilst some 2,000-odd infantry combat vehicles or ICVs – the Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty (BMP) 1 and 2 – were similarly sourced. The latter were presently being upgraded with Russian assistance, which, too, could summarily end or be adversely impacted by the ongoing sanctions.

Security officials are also concerned over the symbiosis that has emerged in recent months between Russia and China, whose army has been locked in a standoff with the Indian Army in Ladakh since May 2020. They said this burgeoning association anticipated Russia gravitating swiftly towards cash-rich China for assistance to overcome sanctions and embargoes.

“This association could end up being a simple trade-off between advanced Russian military knowhow in exchange for Chinese cash and vast industrial manufacturing capacity of assorted defence equipment,” said a senior Navy veteran. Such an arrangement would be one of mutual advantage to both sides and one that could easily be reached, if it had not already been concluded, he added.

Other veterans were of the view that such inescapable sanctions – busting endeavours by Russia – could, as ‘payback’, result in China eventually pressuring Moscow to stanch, if not altogether cease the supply of assorted materiel and related equipment to India which, ironically, Delhi had acquired over decades to deter Beijing and its military and nuclear ally Pakistan.

The reciprocal ‘no limits’ friendship between Russia and China was on full display earlier this week in Beijing, where President Xi Jinping hosted a 130-nation jamboree to celebrate his signature decade-old global Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI essentially envisages China investing in over 150 countries and international organisations to further its global strategic and financial influence to counter that of the US and the dollar.

Putin, who has rarely left Russia after invading Ukraine in February 2022, was the guest of honour at the meet. Speaking immediately after Xi, he pledged support to China and its BRI project, saying it was “in tune with Russian ideas” and heaped lavish praise on Beijing for its achievements since the initiatives launched in 2013.

“The Beijing-Moscow axis that has been proliferating in recent years, is now poised to become firmer, posing a formidable threat to world peace, as both strive to aggressively carve out a new regional and global order based arbitrarily on financial and military might and the recent Israel-Gaza crisis had only worsened the situation,” said Brigadier Rahul Bhonsle of the Security Risks consultancy in Delhi.

Nonetheless, India, which had incrementally emerged as the US’s proxy over the past 15 years to manage China, could well end up facing the brunt of this deadly security partnership between Moscow, Beijing and Islamabad, he warned.

While many veterans say General Chauhan’s forecast regarding Russia needs attention, it also presents the CDS and the three services with a further dilemma that somewhat bedevils easy resolution. And though defence diplomacy is part of the CDS’s overarching charter, making public statements, even if apposite and accurate, tend to constrict India’s diplomatic elbow room in the prevailing geopolitical atmosphere.

"India Calls Canada's Consulate Move 'Unilateral', Clarifies Parity Only for Diplomats in Capitals",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-calls-canadas-consulate-move-unilateral-clarifies-parity-only-for-diplomats-in-capitals,"Oct 20, 2023  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: After Canada stopped in-person consular services at all its consulates after withdrawing 41 diplomats, India described this Canadian action as “unilateral”, asserting that it merely aimed to seek parity in diplomatic missions between Ottawa and Delhi, rather than extending it to outposts in other cities.

On Thursday, Canadian foreign minister Mélanie Joly announced that 41 Canadian diplomats left India, leaving only 21 diplomats manning the high commission in New Delhi and the three consulates in Chandigarh, Mumbai, and Bangalore.

Furthermore, she declared the suspension of in-person services at the three consulates. Although the Canadian high commission in New Delhi will still accept applications, Joly noted that the “service standards for residents of India” would experience disruptions.

Canadian media also quoted officials mentioned in a background briefing that 27 officials from the immigration department had been recalled, leaving only five personnel remaining in India. This downsizing is expected to result in a backlog of approximately 17,500 applications, reported the Globe and Mail.

India issued an official response on Friday afternoon that predominantly contested Joly’s portrayal of the Indian intention to revoke diplomatic immunity for all but 21 Canadian diplomats as a breach of international law.

Late on Friday night, Indian official sources told reporters in the background that clarified that they had not been pursuing a reduction in staffing levels at the three Canadian consulates, which was the rationale behind Ottawa’s decision to suspend in-person consulate services.

For the first time, Indian sources stated that “parity has been sought in the diplomatic representations of our Missions in Ottawa and New Delhi”.

“There is no impact on Canadian diplomatic strength in their Consulates in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chandigarh. The Canadian decision to cease operations of their three consulates in India, is unilateral, and not related to the implementation of parity,” said sources.

Till now, the Ministry of External Affairs has never publicly said that the demand for parity was only limited to the main diplomatic missions in the capital cities. India has a high commission in Ottawa and two consulates in Vancouver and Toronto.

On September 21, the MEA spokesperson had first announced that India had conveyed to the “Canadian government that there should be parity in strength and rank equivalence in our diplomatic presence, in mutual diplomatic presence”.

Further at the October 5 media briefing, MEA was asked whether it anticipated that the demand for parity would lead to a deterioration in visa services, particularly in states like Punjab and Gujarat.

The spokesperson had replied, “…let me also clarify in the context of the parity, it’s up to the Canadian side who they choose to staff their high commission with. So I would refer you to them, for any details. In this regard, our concerns are related to ensuring parity in diplomatic presence. And again, as I said, why? And I think, you know, that’s been our focus very clearly.”

Official sources also confirmed Joly’s statement that New Delhi had given a deadline of October 10, which was extended till October 20. “Attempts by Canada to portray this as an ‘arbitrary’ and ‘overnight’ decision is factually inaccurate,” they said on Friday, adding that the extension was given as “details and modalities of implementation, including the list of Canadian diplomats who would continue to be accorded diplomatic immunities and privileges were being worked out in consultation with the Canadian side”.

The Indian side also stated that Canada had been told that “in order to limit the size of the Missions in New Delhi and Ottawa, only a specific number of diplomats as per parity would continue to enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities”.

Repeating the argument made in the official press release, sources said that India’s action was within the provisions of Article 11.1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (VCDR) which allows the receiving state to limit the size of a diplomatic mission. “Article 11.1 has been used in the past by other countries on many occasions,” they noted.

The Canadian foreign minister had claimed that a “unilateral revocation of diplomatic privileges and immunities is contrary to international law, including the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations”.

Describing this action as “completely unreasonable and escalatory”, she had said that India accredited each and every one of the Canadian diplomats they are now expelling. “Diplomatic immunities should be respected and cannot be unilaterally revoked by a host country. If we allow this norm to be broken, no diplomat anywhere would be safe. As such, the Government of Canada will continue to respect diplomatic norms and not reciprocate this action,” said Joly.

Expanding upon the argument that India’s approach to achieving parity did not infringe upon the VCDR, Indian sources additionally contended that Canadian law empowers Ottawa to provide “comparable” treatment to foreign diplomats and to “withdraw any of the privileges, immunities and benefits accorded or granted”."
Harassment of Diplomats: Pakistan Recalls Envoy as India Plays Down Move,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/harassment-of-diplomats-pakistan-calls-back-its-envoy-india-plays-down-the-move,"Mar 15, 2018  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: After Pakistan called back its envoy for consultation following repeated incidents of harassment of high commission staff, India played down the move as “routine in nature” and stated that it will not respond to these issues through the media.

On Thursday, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal announced, “Our high commissioner in New Delhi has been asked to come to Islamabad for consultations.”

He told reporters at the weekly briefing in Islamabad that the Indian government has repeatedly been made aware of the incidents of intimidation, but there has been no action till now.

In Delhi, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar expressed surprise that the temporary return of an envoy to headquarters for consultations should require a response from the host country.

“Frankly, I am a bit surprised as to why this question is being posed to me. Consultations by any resident ambassador/high commissioner with their headquarters is a matter for that country. It is pretty normal and routine in nature. We, of course, have no comments to offer on the news reports regarding the Pakistan High Commissioner,” said Kumar.

On the matter of the complaints mentioned by Pakistan, the MEA spokesperson said that India did not “wish to respond to these issues through the media but through established diplomatic channels”.

But, he did publicly for the first time say that Indian High Commission “is facing a litany of issues which have not been resolved for several months”.

He added that these issues were brought to the attention of the Pakistani authorities through the proper routes. “We raise these issues in good faith through diplomatic channels and not through the media”.

Kumar said that the India wants “immediate resolution” for the complaints of intimidation faced by Indian staff “so that the safety and security of our diplomatic Mission and its diplomatic and consular officials is assured”.

“We would like our Mission to function normally, without any obstruction or harassment, in keeping with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961,” he stated.

Indian sources had stated that there had been a series of occurrences which included the stoppage of official vehicles and unauthorised entries. Indian diplomats were also denied membership to Islamabad Club, which remains open to the rest of the diplomatic community.

According to sources, a ‘redline’ was crossed when there was an “ISI raid” into the residential complex and chancery service providers were stopped from continuing their work in February 15. Electricity and water had been cut off to the under-construction portion of the premises. Indian high commissioner Ajay Bisaria lodge a complaint when he met with the Pakistan foreign secretary Tehmima Janjua on February 16.

In Delhi, Pakistan high commission reported an escalating series of incidents from the second week of March. It included a similar pattern of contractors being stopped from providing services to the high commission, vehicles of officials being forcibly stopped and passengers being filmed by ‘unknown men’.

Pakistani media carried a clip of four helmet-wearing men on motorcycles following and filming a high commission vehicle. There had been two reported incidents of vehicles of senior diplomats being ‘intimidated’ when they were ferrying back children from school.

Pakistan had also invoked Vienna Convention and said that the security and safety of Pakistani diplomats and their families is the responsibility of the Indian government."
COVID-19 Data In South Asia Shows India Is Doing Worse Than Its Neighbours,https://m.thewire.in/article/health/covid-19-data-in-south-asia-shows-india-is-doing-worse-than-its-neighbours,"May 09, 2020  |  Deepankar Basu and Priyanka Srivastava","This is the first of a three-part analysis looking at the comparative performance of major South Asian nations in terms of managing the public health and economic fallout of the novel coronavirus.

In recent days, comparisons of India’s COVID-19 situation with countries in Europe and North America have been often used by the Indian government to highlight the apparent success of its pandemic strategy.

These comparisons are not fair. Hence, the conclusions are largely misleading.

The spread of the pandemic has been very different in Europe and North America from most other countries in the world, including India. This has puzzled scientists and public health experts. Many hypotheses explain this puzzle, like climate, geography, genetic make-up, age-structure of population, BCG vaccination, are currently under investigation.

No matter which of these factors turn out to be important, the fact of the difference in the shape of the pandemic between Europe and North America, on the one hand, and the rest of the world, on the other, remains salient.

Also Read: Tracking COVID-19 in India: The BCG Hypothesis

The effectiveness, or otherwise, of India’s pandemic strategy (at the Central level) can be better assessed through a comparison with its neighbours. In addition to being similar in terms of economic structure and average income, India’s neighbouring countries are also similar in all these respects that might account for differences in the pandemic’s spread – climate, geography, genetic make-up, age structure, BCG vaccination. Therefore, variation in the spread of the pandemic in these countries can be largely attributed to country-specific responses.

Motivated with this understanding, we offer a comparative analysis of the spread of, and government responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic in four South Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

The spread of COVID-19

The first case of COVID-19 was reported at very different times in the four countries we have studied. The first to report a case was Sri Lanka – its first case of COVID-19 was reported on 27 January, 2020. Within three days, India reported its first case – on 30 January. It would be another four weeks before Pakistan reported its first case on 26 February while Bangladesh reported its first case on 8 March, a week and a half after Pakistan.

According to the Worldometers website, on May 8, the cumulative case count in the four countries are as follows: Bangladesh has 13,134 cases; India has 59,693 cases; Pakistan has 26,435 cases; and Sri Lanka has recorded a total of 824 cases.

Part of the variation in the cumulative case counts comes from the different duration for which the pandemic has been active in each country. To get a better comparative picture of the rapidity of the spread across the four countries, we therefore start counting cumulative cases in each country since it first reported 50 or more COVID-19 cases.

We summarise the comparative picture of the COVID-19 outbreak in the four countries using several charts. Figure 1 presents cumulative case counts since they first reported their 50th case; and Figure 2 presents the daily case counts since they first reported their 50th case count.

The two charts together highlight some important differences across these four countries regarding the spread of COVID-19. Sri Lanka is the clear outlier and the best performer here. It has had the outbreak for the longest duration but has managed to limit the case count the most. Not only is its total case count several fold lower than in India and Pakistan (Figure 1), but its daily growth rate has also been declining over the past several days (Figure 2).

India and Pakistan have recorded the highest number of cases (Figure 1), with India having about 11,499 more cases than Pakistan on the 53rd day of the outbreak (since each country first reported 50 or more cases). When we look at the number of daily cases, we see that not only are they high but have also been rising for the past several days (Figure 2).

The picture for Bangladesh is probably somewhere in between, on the one hand, Sri Lanka, and on the other, India and Pakistan. The total case count in Bangladesh was relatively low on May 8 only because the epidemic started late in that country. But if we look at Figure 1, we see that its cumulative case count has been comparable to India’s and Pakistan’s on similar days since it first reported its 50th case. In Figure 2 we also see that the daily case count is rising in Bangladesh. But the rate of increase in case counts seems to be lower in Bangladesh: in Figure 1, the total case count trajectory seems less steep for Bangladesh than for India and Pakistan.

Death rate

In Figure 3, we look at the death rate of COVID-19 (deaths per 100 confirmed cases) in the four countries. This gives an indication of how fatal the pandemic has been in each country. Bangladesh started out with a very high death rate, but it has managed to reduce it drastically to below 2% within a month of the outbreak. In Sri Lanka, there was an initial period when the death rate was rising. But from day 20 onwards, the death rate in Sri Lanka has fallen steadily and is now close to 1%. In contrast, Pakistan and India have both seen the death rate rise over time. In terms of levels, the death rate at present is highest in India – at about 3.52%.

Conclusion

In terms of the spread of COVID-19, Sri Lanka has the best position and India is the worst hit. After about 40 days into the epidemic (which, in our analysis, starts when a country first reports 50 or more cases), India has consistently recorded the highest cumulative and daily case count. Its daily case count has kept increasing, and it has recorded by far the highest death rate among these four countries.

The Pandemic is Changing the Face of Indian Labour,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/covid-19-pandemic-indian-labour,"May 09, 2020  |  Arun Kumar","Labour Day is typically meant to highlight the protection of worker rights. This year, it came at a time when labourers are struggling to survive and their rights need protection more than ever. The heart-rending death of 16 workers who were sleeping on rail tracks, exhausted during their 700 km walk to home highlights the plight of workers today.

In the US, more than 33 million people have lost their jobs in the past 7 weeks. This is already more than the loss in employment seen in the two years of the global financial crisis.

Back home, where workers have little social security, CMIE data suggests that more than a hundred million workers have lost employment, a vast majority from the unorganised sector. The figure is likely to be even larger given that it would be difficult to capture the employment status of the migrating workers.

Workers are desperate. Not only have they lost their meagre income, but now their only options are to risk contracting COVID-19 or facing starvation. So, many of them set out to walk hundreds if not thousands of kilometres to return to their villages, carrying their few belongings, children on their shoulders and no food in their bellies. Some have already perished on the way. In Karnataka, they were not even being allowed to go back home, in a controversy that sparked allegations of bonded labour, forcing the government to quickly take a U-turn.

The pandemic has highlighted the real working and living conditions of most workers. The unfolding crisis does make one stop and wonder – how can this be the situation of most Indian workers, 70 years after independence?

True, conditions are not what they were in 1947. There is more education and better health facilities. Child mortality has dropped and longevity has increased. Many of the poor own mobile phones and wear chappals. Electricity and tapped water have reached many villages. But this is expected in an economy where GDP has grown by 32.2 times and per capita income by 8.2 times since 1950, as some fruits of development trickle down to some of the marginalised.

Workers suffer indignity

What is missing though is a dignified life which should be the right of every citizen in a democratic country. The ruling class often ignores this and argues that the marginal improvement in the material conditions of many workers is enough. They even imply that the workers ought to be grateful for this slight betterment and portray it as the success of the prevailing unequal economic system. In the present ruling economic ideology, equity is not high on the agenda.

The ruling elites thrive on the poor working and living condition of labour for their lifestyle and profits. Consequently, neither the state nor the businesses grant the workers their rights. For instance, large numbers do not get a minimum wage or social security or protective gear at worksites. They do not have security of employment, often wages are not paid in time, muster rolls are fudged, there is no entitlement to leave, etc. Given their low wages, they are forced to live in squalid conditions with many sharing a small room in a slum. Water is scarce and drinking water more so. Access to clean toilets is limited and disease spreads. There is lack of civic amenities like sewage. Their children are often deprived of schools and playgrounds.

With COVID-19 as an excuse, state after state is reducing what little security was available to workers by eliminating or diluting various laws so as to favour businesses. In Uttar Pradesh, at least 14 labour laws like the Minimum Wages Act and Industrial Disputes Act are being suspended for three years in an effort to attract capital. Similar is the case with MP and Gujarat. The plea is that this is needed to revive economic activity. The chief minister of MP has said that this would lead to new investment in the state. Whether or not new investment will come at this time when businesses are unable to start or they face a situation of low capacity utilisation, what this would ensure is competition among states to relax and eliminate labour laws. Thus, the poor working conditions of labour will deteriorate further.

In India, workers are characterised as either organised or unorganised. Those in the former category work in larger businesses and have some formal rights (which are being diluted further) but often they find it difficult to enforce them. Increasingly the big and medium businesses are employing contract labour provided by contractors from the unorganised sector, rather than permanent workers. Businesses pay the contractors who then pay workers a part of the payment they receive. So, businesses claim that they are paying the minimum wage but the workers don’t get it. When even the minimum wage is inadequate for a dignified life, what the workers receive cannot ensure a civilised existence. Most workers in the cities, where land prices and rents are high, are forced to live in slums mushrooming on vacant land or in urbanised villages with rudimentary facilities and massive overcrowding. Dharavi is an example of this.

The organised sector workers have greater social security and receive a higher wage but even that is inadequate for a civilised life. The unorganised sector acts as a reserve army of labour keeping wages low in the organised sector also. Consequently, large numbers of the organised sector workers also live in slums like their comrades from the unorganised sector.

Pandemic highlights the workers’ conditions

SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, spreads rapidly. Since neither a medicine nor a vaccine against it is available, a lockdown of the population is essential to slow its spread. But lockdown requires isolation and sanitation, which are not possible in congested areas in slums. Frequent washing of hands is required but how is that possible without clean water or soap? So, the miserable living conditions of a large number of workers have been sharply highlighted.

If 5-10 people live in a room, how is isolation 24×7 feasible? Without physical isolation, the disease is bound to spread, as is the case in Dharavi. Further, they do not have the money to get tested or go to a hospital for treatment, so it festers. They are also poorly nourished so their resistance to the disease is less. They often have comorbidities which makes them more susceptible to the disease.

A lockdown requires businesses to close and lay off workers or not pay them wages. This again highlights the insecure working conditions of workers. The workers have small incomes and little savings so they cannot stock up on essentials of life to survive weeks of lockdown. They, and if their family is with them, start to starve unless someone provides them with food.

So, while a lockdown works for the middle classes and the well-off sections, it is next to impossible for the poor unless the state steps in and makes arrangements. There has to be free testing and hospitalisation, provision of essentials of life and clean water wherever the workers are. Furthermore, slums need to be decongested and some moved to tented colonies in vacant grounds, empty school buildings, halls, etc.

So, the prerequisites for a successful lockdown were not put in place quickly enough. Consequently, the lockdown has been only partially implemented, allowing the disease to spread. More cases are being discovered as testing is enhanced. The implication is that the disease has been spreading without our knowing it. Many zero case districts may not be so. Some reports indicate that in a few districts, the number of deaths is much larger this April than last year but the cause is not known.

Life vs livelihood

Businesses want the lockdown to end so that they can restart and if not earn profits, at least start cutting their losses. This is being presented as the trade-off between life and livelihood. They argue that workers without work and incomes will die of hunger. They also argue for ‘herd immunity’ – when the majority will develop immunity to the disease – saying it is inevitable. But how many will die in this process? The UK experimented with herd immunity but, as the number of cases and deaths spiralled, policy had to be reversed. They now have the largest number of deaths in Europe.

In India, even if 3% of the infected people die, it would mean thousands or lakhs of lives lost, depending on how many people are infected. It will quickly overwhelm our weak health infrastructure. Are we prepared for this and for the social upheaval that will follow?

Those who now worry about livelihoods have never shown such concern for the workers in normal times. They have paid low wages to earn big profits. How else, at such a low level of per capita income, India had the fourth-largest number of billionaires in the world? Clearly, most of the gains of development, in the last 75 years and more specifically since 1991, have been cornered by businessmen – by hook and by crook. They have made money not only in white but huge sums in black.

Businesses have manipulated policy in their favour – before 1991, by resorting to crony capitalism and since then by tilting policy in their favour, curtailment of workers’ rights and pressuring the government to weaken support to the marginalised sections on the plea that the markets should be allowed to function. Now using COVID-19 as a shield, workers’ rights are being further curtailed. No wonder, the country collects only 6% of GDP as direct taxes in spite of the huge disparities. The burden of taxation falls on the indirect taxes which are paid by everyone, including the marginalised.

It is clear that businesses asking for lifting of lockdown in the name of livelihood are not concerned about how many poor will die but, as usual, about their profits. They did not worry about people, workers and farmers earlier and not even now, otherwise they would have asked for a better implemented lockdown and a ‘survival package’ which would have protected the lives of the marginalised sections.

The lesson that should have been learnt is that India was unable to cope with the pandemic because of the adverse living conditions of the majority of our people. And now, labour laws are being diluted which will ensure a worsening of living conditions. This will ensure that when the next pandemic comes in due course the country will flounder. The tragedy is that India is today headed towards a societal breakdown for short term gains of some. But, a basic rethink of any current ruling ideology is always at a heavy cost.

The IMR has declined significantly over the years; in 1971, it was 129.

Madhya Pradesh continues to have the worst IMR in the country at 48 while Nagaland has the best at 4. In fact, MP’s IMR has worsened slightly from 2017 when it stood at 47. The urban rural differential in MP is huge with the rural IMR at 51, while the urban IMR at 32.

Photo: Reuters/Amit Dave

What started as a health crisis is now turning into a ‘black swan’ event for the global economy and society. Staring at an uncertain future of work, the lockdown has rendered the workforce, in particular the vulnerable informal workers, stranded and without any stable source of income.

This crisis offers us an opportunity to think both short and long term to ensure that a resilient economy emerges which respects labour as a critical factor of production.

As per estimates by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), around 400 million informal workers are at a risk of falling into deeper poverty levels in India. In such a situation, how does India ensure that the drivers of its economy do not become collateral damage of a pandemic?

With the imposition of a sudden lockdown, there has been no effort by the state for the safe and smooth transit of migrant workers from their workplaces to their homes. At the same time, there is a lack of basic necessities in their workplaces or where they are stranded. As economic activities remain at a standstill, the workers are forced to be contained in an economic and emotional discomfort.

To add to that, already vulnerable workers are also victims of information asymmetry. The Bandra railway station incident in Mumbai in mid-April is a testimony to this.

On the industry front, imminent economic losses are instigating enterprises, large and small alike, to rework their business and work structure. This leaves the workers in an abyss of uncertainty regarding the future of their work. Further, the industry oriented COVID-19-induced relaxations in labour laws, that have been introduced in several states including Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab are likely to make working conditions harsher, lay-offs easier and monitoring less stringent.

This raises a pertinent question. How do we rapidly reinstate the informal workforce in a post-COVID-19 scenario and at the same time ensure sustainable economic well-being for them in order to build their resilience?

To tackle this situation, a multi-pronged solution can be thought of with immediate, short term and longer term manifestations. However, along with these structural interventions, immediate relief measures that are being provided by the state, such as direct cash transfers and food supplies need to be effectively and efficiently administered to ensure maximum coverage and optimum impact. The focus should be on containing the public health crisis while reducing the damage that it has caused to the economic fabric of the country.

How many workers are needed?

The first challenge will come in ensuring that factory and other labour-intensive operations perfectly implement social distancing principles. As an immediate measure, a strategy needs to be carefully planned for the institutionalisation of public health and other safety protocols before industrial operations resume.

In order to achieve this, the state, in consultation with experts and union representatives, can prepare the number of workers per unit area of factory floor required for safe operations at a given capacity, across different manufacturing sectors. Such a benchmark can help the state in assessing the optimal requirement of workers in different industries in the wake of social distancing and health standards. The nodal agency for preparing such a database can be the respective state’s industries and labour department, and its decentralised machinery in different districts and zones.

While business operations resume, simultaneously a database of workers needs to be created which will comprise information about the migrated workers including last-drawn wages, work experience, previous place of work, skill levels, training and educational qualifications and place of origin. This database should be created through a concerted effort of enterprises and the government, in particular the labour and skills department at the Central and state level. Also, necessary provisions should be made for self-enrolment of workers in the database.

To ensure transparency, continuity and efficiency in the process of database creation, technological resources can be leveraged. State resources such as existing databases and the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity can also be roped in for this process. To undertake this exercise, the administrative capacity of the state can be enhanced by steering the local governments to the forefront and bringing on board grassroots volunteers including Common Service Centres. However, such an exercise would also require adequate data privacy safeguards to ensure protection of the workers’ data.

In the short term, the database so created can feed into an ‘employment exchange’ model for informal workers. Such a model will ensure a temporal match of enterprise’s demand for workers with supply of labour, with the state potentially assuming the role of a de facto contractor. In other words, if needed, the state could be empowered to execute the allocation of workplaces to enrolled workers.

Furthermore, the state can utilise this platform to ensure that certain conditions of work are being adhered to. For instance, the state can ensure that wages are fixed at pre-COVID-19 or minimum wage levels, provisions of necessary protective equipment are met and safety protocols are followed. Once these conditions are fulfilled, the state can allot a suitable working place for each of the enrolled workers. This exchange can be integrated with the ‘Digital India’ vision of the government of India by using ICT solutions as the means of implementation. The state can gradually transfer this exchange model to the market, where it can be facilitated through aggregator business models.

In the longer term, a much needed behavioural transformation should be brought about wherein the State adopts a hands-off approach while the industry treats its workforce as a ‘human asset’ rather than a ‘cost of production’. In order to facilitate this transformation and build workers’ resilience, there should be a focus on ensuring adequate social security and skill development for them through the exchange model.

Finally, to regain the trust of the workers, there should be an emphasis on elimination of fear and stigma from the minds of workers and their community members by using sensitisation and capacity-building measures. This may be facilitated through grassroots-level volunteers and civil society organisations at the source locations of the workers. Similarly, at the work destination, this can be ensured through effective implementation and monitoring of public health protocols at the enterprise level.

While such structural reforms in the informal labour realm have been in the pipeline for quite some time, it is a humanitarian crisis that has made it imperative for speedy and sustainable implementation of the much-needed reforms.

On Friday, defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated by video conference the road between Dharchula to Lipulekh, which will reduce the length of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra by several days.

Nepal opposition leaders immediately raised the pitch, asking for the government to clear its public stance.

A day later, Nepal foreign ministry expressed “regret” at India’s “unilateral act” and called upon India to refrain from carrying out any activity on Nepalese territory.

In a lengthy statement, Nepal foreign ministry reminded that Nepal claims all territories east of Mahakali river, “including Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipu Lekh” as per the 1816 Sugauli Treaty.

“This was reiterated by the Government of Nepal several times in the past and most recently through a diplomatic note addressed to the Government of India dated 20 November 2019 in response to the new political map issued by the latter,” it said.

The context of the last diplomatic note is that months ago, India had issued a new political map to show the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two new Union Territories. In it, it depicted Kalapani as part of Indian territory, which led to a strong objection from Nepal.

It further pointed out that when India and China had agreed to include Lipu Lekh pass as a bilateral trade route in a May 2015 joint statement, Nepal had issued separate diplomatic protest notes to the two Asian giants for not obtaining Kathmandu’s consent.

On the latest move, Nepal stated:

“This unilateral act runs against the understanding reached between the two countries including at the level of Prime Ministers that a solution to boundary issues would be sought through negotiation”.

Stating that Nepal sought a diplomatic solution in the spirit of friendly relations, the foreign ministry asserted:

“In light of this development, the Government of Nepal calls upon the Government of India to refrain from carrying out any activity inside the territory of Nepal”.

The Kathmandu Post had reported that Nepalese foreign secretary Shankar Das Bairagi spoke with Indian ambassador Vinay Kwatra on Friday.

The statement issued in Kathmandu also reiterated that Nepal had twice proposed dates for holding meeting between the foreign secretaries of the two sides after the Kalapani controversy gathered momentum last year.

Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali had told visiting Indian journalists in February that if India could solve long-standing and complex boundary disputes with Bangladesh, then it should be able to do so with Nepal.

He had also highlighted that India had still not given a concrete response for a meeting of the two foreign secretaries.

Late evening, India’s Ministry of External Affairs responded that the road section “lies entirely within the territory of India”.

“Under the present project, the same road has been made pliable for the ease and convenience of pilgrims, locals and traders,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.

He added that both countries have an established mechanism on boundary matters and that the delineation of the boundary was still an “ongoing process”. “India is committed to resolving outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue and in the spirit of our close and friendly bilateral relations with Nepal,” stated Srivastava.

On the demand for a meeting of foreign secretaries, he said that the meeting will be held “once the dates are finalised between the two sides after the two societies and governments have successfully dealt with the challenge of COVID-19 emergency”.

Indicating its annoyance, the foreign ministry’s statement today also brought up the lack of progress in completing the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal India relations.

The report had been finalised in mid-2018, but has still not been formally submitted. Both countries had agreed that the report would be made public after the EPG members would hand over the report personally to the two prime ministers. However, the Indian prime minister has not given an appointment to the EPG in the last two years, for the ceremony.

“The Group has concluded its task and prepared a consensus report. The Government of Nepal is ready to receive the report and believes that it will be in the interest of the two countries to implement its recommendations which will also help address the outstanding issues left by the history, thereby paving the way for ever stronger neighbourly relations,” said the Nepalese foreign minister.

While India responded to both the Lipulekh matter and demand for meeting of foreign secretaries, the MEA spokesperson was silent on Nepal raising the issue of the finalisation of the EPG report."

VE Day: Recalling Memorable Successes by the Indian Armed Forces in Burma,https://m.thewire.in/article/history/ve-day-pacific-theatre-indian-armed-forces-japan-rangoon,"May 08, 2020  |  K. S. Nair","VE (Victory in Europe) Day marks the acceptance of Nazi Germany’s surrender to the Allies during World War II on May 8, 1945. In most of Europe, the US and Canada, the day saw huge celebrations, crowds in the streets and ringing speeches. It was treated as much less significant by troops on the Burma Front and in the Pacific Theatre.

The muted reaction in those theatres was, of course, due to the recognition that Japan remained “unsubdued”, as Winston Churchill said on VE Day, and seemingly still full of fight. Wartime precedents were not encouraging. Italy, the first of the major Axis powers to give in, had surrendered as early as October 1943, but Germany had continued to fight for a full seventeen months longer. Japan had suffered some defeats since 1942, but her spirit was unbroken, and the Japanese soldier remained the most tenacious of enemies in defence. Allied strategic planners considered it quite possible that Japan would hold out for a year or two longer; and the men doing the fighting were all too aware that their job was not yet done.

But there had in fact been some memorable successes by the Indian armed forces in Burma, around the same time. They were celebrated locally but were eclipsed in the press by momentous events in Europe at the time. Now seems a good time to recall some of them.

Two months earlier, on the Arakan coast of Burma (now Rakhine state in Myanmar), one of the key Allied army formations in the field had been the 51st Infantry Brigade, which as it happened, had just become the first entirely Indian brigade of the Raj-era Indian Army. All three constituent battalions were Indian (the British usually combined a maximum of two Indian battalions with a British or other Commonwealth battalion), and its commander was Brigadier K.S. Thimayya, the first Indian to command a brigade in action. The brigade had been successful and was closely supported from the air by Hurricane fighter-bombers of No 4 Squadron of the Indian Air Force (which, incidentally, had just been re-designated the Royal Indian Air Force). Their successes were adding to the growing narrative of the Indian armed forces’ contribution to Allied victory.

But even more significantly, in this theatre at this time, the main thrust and the most important objective was to try and capture Rangoon before the monsoon broke. Inland from the coastal actions, three great divisions of the Indian Army, nearly 40,000 soldiers, were fighting their way towards Rangoon, southwards along the great Irrawaddy River. The monsoon was already threatening, and it was crucial to reach Rangoon before the rains, as they would make much of the country virtually impassable.

As it happened, aerial reconnaissance on the first few days of May suggested that the Japanese had withdrawn from the city. Allied Prisoners of War held in the Rangoon Jail had scrounged some whitewash and scrawled, in huge letters on the prison roof, the message, “Japs Gone. Extract Digit”. That memorable second phrase was intended, by its parliamentary re-phrasing of the intentionally vulgar military admonition, “Pull your finger out,” to convey authenticity, in a theatre where deception was common.

A few days before VE Day Group Captain John Grandy of the RAF, flying a Dakota transport aircraft, had dropped Allied flags into the jail courtyard and landed at Rangoon’s airfield. The same day, Indian paratroopers landed at the mouth of the Rangoon River. The next day, Hurricanes of the No 7 Squadron of the RIAF, led by their CO Squadron Leader P.C. Lal, flew in support over 26th Indian Division, as they landed on the river banks and marched into the city, literally just before the rains began. This was a highly satisfying closure of a military history circle, as the Allies, including some ill-prepared Indian troops, had been humiliatingly driven out of Rangoon by the Japanese in 1942.

Both Grandy and Lal would become chiefs of their respective countries’ Air Forces, and Thimayya would become the Indian Army Chief.

Perhaps most whimsically, back on the Arakan coast, No 2 Squadron of the RIAF, commanded by the swashbuckling Squadron Leader Jaswant Singh, was coming to the end of a successful tour of operations on the island of Akyab. And on that very day, they were hosting a party to bid farewell to the station and the RAF squadrons they were billeted alongside. The squadron diary records that the party started with a picnic on the beach, which had to hastily relocate indoors as the first showers of the season materialised. A troupe of ENSA entertainers was visiting Akyab at the time, and the squadron was thrilled when three charming hostesses from the troupe joined their party.

Veterans of the squadron are hard-pressed to remember that it was VE Day, but most of them remember the ENSA hostesses who came to their party that evening. Fighting men’s memories can be quite selective!

India Raises Borrowing Limit by Over 50% to Rs 12 Lakh Crore as Virus Grips Economy,https://m.thewire.in/article/government/covid-19-economy-india-borrowing-limit,"May 09, 2020  |  Arup Roy and Arup Roychoudhury","New Delhi: The government on Friday evening steeply revised up its 2020-21 borrowing programme by 53.85% to Rs 12 lakh crore, from Rs 7.8 lakh crore estimated earlier, indicating that the Centre is giving shape to an imminent and sizeable fiscal package to arrest the COVID-19 related slowdown.

“The above revision in borrowings has been necessitated on account of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in a statement on its website.

Between May 11 and September 30, the government will be borrowing Rs 6 trillion from the market. The original plan, as announced on March 31, was that in the first half (between April and September), the borrowing would be Rs 4.88 trillion, of which the government has already borrowed Rs 98,000 crore from the markets.

“This indicates that stimulus measures are probably around the corner. The government has got resources from fuel excise, and now additional borrowing,” said Badrish Kulhalli, head of fixed income at HDFC Life Insurance.

Senior government sources confirmed to Business Standard that the RBI has been given a relatively free hand to keep the yield curve in check through expanded open-market operations in secondary markets.

“The RBI will have to participate in OMOs in some way and keep the yield curve from jumping up. There will clearly be a pressure on yields and the RBI will have to manage it. It will involve expanded OMOs,” said an official involved in the discussions on the increased borrowing.

When asked if the increased target also means that the RBI will now monetize the deficit by directly purchasing bonds from the government, the official said: “The RBI has so far not keen on private placements.”

Officials confirmed that the discussions between Finance Ministry and the central bank on increasing the borrowing target took place in the past 7-8 days, after the new economic affairs secretary Tarun Bajaj took charge. There were extensive deliberations on whether to announce the increase now or along with the borrowing calendar for October-January, in September.

A second official admitted that the increased borrowing means the 2020-21 fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of GDP no longer holds, since borrowing is one of the means to finance the deficit.

A quick calculation shows that provided all other parameters remain the same, the fiscal deficit will expand to around 5.3% of GDP for this year. However, the other assumptions made in the budget, like a 10% nominal GDP growth, will clearly not be realised due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The fiscal deficit will expand, but we can’t put a number since the situation is quite dynamic,” the second official said.

The revised calendar showed that every month there would be Rs 1.2 trillion of borrowing. Clearly, this is way above the market appetite. All kind of dated securities maturing in two years and above will be used, including floating rate bonds.

The bond yields had nosedived on Friday as the government introduced a new 10-year bond with a cut-off coupon of 5.79%. The old benchmark 10-year bond yield also dipped below 6% for the first time since February 2009. The benchmark 10-year bonds had closed at 5.97%, from its previous close of 6.05%.

Before the surprise borrowing calendar was announced, the bond market was bullish expecting further rate cuts and not a very large package, according to Harihar Krishnamurthy, head of treasury at First Rand Bank. But the calendar indicates a sizeable package could be coming pretty soon.

Clearly, the government aims to borrow cheap, but the yields will shoot up for certain, unless the RBI comes up with deep rate cuts, or declares heavy secondary market bond purchases say, experts. With the borrowing calendar in place, chances of private placement with the RBI is more or less nixed.

“We need considerable support from RBI, else RBI’s rate cuts will become redundant. Amid credit crisis, borrowers would face more challenges, while investors would be more focused on intertemporal choices,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, associate director at India Ratings and Research.

According to Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic advisor of State Bank of India (SBI), the central bank must now conduct reverse repo and term reverse repo operations without any collateral. Such non-availability of securities in liquidity operations will boost the demand for government securities, and if Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) is introduced, which is a facility under which the RBI would absorb liquidity at a lower rate than reverse repo and without any collateral, the entire interest rate structure can be pulled down.

“In particular, lower operative overnight rate, short term rate and lower supply and generation of additional demand will bring down the yield of long-dated Government bonds also, thereby pulling down the sovereign yield curve. This will also reduce the interest cost of RBI,” Ghosh said.

India Must Leverage Its Global Clout to Spur Institutional Reform in the Post-COVID-19 Era,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/coronavirus-multilateralism-reforms,"May 04, 2020  |  Manjeev Puri","It has been a long-standing belief that the horse-shoe table, which seats the UN Security Council, will only open up if there is a cataclysmic event in the world.

Perhaps, the coronavirus pandemic is it.

After years of being pilloried, multilateralism and global cooperation have seen a surge in demand with the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strong case for this during the G20’s video conference on the pandemic.

The scale and global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit the developed world the hardest, has unleashed a barrage of criticism over the WHO’s handling of the crisis, its purported attempts to shield the Chinese of any culpability and for not ringing the alarm soon enough. The US, its biggest financial backer, wants to withdraw its funding and has accused it of becoming “Chinese”.

The US threat is not unlike its action at the WTO but also guided by the president’s electoral compulsions. Nonetheless, the huge challenge posed by the outbreak and such pandemics demands global cooperation from countries across all regions and, most importantly, from both the developed and developing world. Reform within the WHO is, therefore, critical and should be in the interest of both the US and China.

The pandemic is also a global health emergency that must be dealt with using a multi-pronged approach. But, at the same time, its impact requires pro-active global cooperation to mitigate its onslaught on our economies and other elements of our lives that have evolved in recent decades, including travel.

Key amongst organisations that are in dire need of reform are the Bretton Woods Institutions – the IMF and the World Bank. The International Civil Aviation Organisation, which guides international air travel rules may also scrutinised.

The year 2020 marks the 75th anniversary since the UN’s inception and the UN General Assembly is scheduled to hold a special high-level event on September 21 under the rubric ‘The Future We Want, the UN We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism’. It will also adopt an outcome document on this occasion which ought to set the global agenda for the coming decades.

India has a special place in the emerging scheme of things. While our membership of the G20 is a testimony of the same, it is also clear that even to keep things under check, let alone ameliorate matters, India, which houses a sixth of humanity, is critical. We must, therefore, push strongly for institutional reform in multilateral bodies so that their governance leverages the capabilities of the major players among both the developed and developing countries. Apart from the WHO and the Bretton Woods Institutions, India should also push for expansion of the permanent membership of the UN Security Council, a priority that requires our immediate refocus.

India will be serving on the UN Security Council for the term 2021-22 and will have the opportunity to weigh-in on major global decisions for a two year period. We last served on the Security Council in 2011-12, a time of great turbulence in international peace and security with the rise of the Arab Spring protests and changes to the landscape of Middle Eastern politics that continue to bedevil global peace.

It is unlikely that India’s tenure in 2021-22 will be bereft of such turmoil. Indeed, even in the context of the coronavirus outbreak, while a UNSC resolution against them was not possible given their veto, the Chinese managed to stave off discussions on the subject in the UNSC in March because they held its presidency.

India has two other special openings, around major summits, where a push for multilateral re-vitalisation and reform can be made. The BRICS Summit this year scheduled to be held in Russia and, even though not yet announced, the 2021 summit to be held in India. India will also be hosting the G20 Summit in 2022, when we will be marking the 75th anniversary of Independence. During both of these Summits, India will also hold a seat at the UN Security Council.

As the host, there are certain prerogatives that India will enjoy in terms of setting the agenda, which should be effectively used to drum up support amongst the biggest players in the world for reforms in multilateral governance in the critical areas of international peace and security, climate, disaster response and resilience and pandemics.

New Delhi: Reacting sharply to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s comments on the death of seven civilians in Kashmir’s Pulwama, India Thursday said Islamabad should mind its own affairs which are in a “mess” instead of interfering in a neighbouring country.

“I think it will be better if they mind their own business and look at the internal affairs which are in a mess,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said during a media briefing when asked about Khan’s remarks.

On Sunday, Khan condemned the death of seven civilians in Kashmir’s Pulwama and threatened to raise the issue at the UN.

Seven civilians died Saturday when security forces opened fire at an unruly mob that had gathered at the site of an encounter in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district.

"COVID-19 Crisis: India's Unemployment Rate Soars to 27.11%, Says CMIE",https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/india-unemployment-rate,"May 06, 2020  |  PTI","Mumbai: The COVID-19 crisis has led to a spike in the country’s unemployment rate to 27.11% for the week ended May 3, up from the under 7% level before the start of the pandemic in mid-March, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) has said.

The Mumbai-based think tank said the rate of unemployment was the highest in the urban areas, which constitute the most number of the red zones due to the COVID-19 cases, at 29.22%, as against 26.69% for the rural areas.

Analysts have been warning about the spectre of unemployment ever since the country was put under lockdown on March 25 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to arrest the spread of the virus infections.

Scenes of migrants fleeing urban centres like Delhi and Mumbai only confirmed the long-held concerns on their employment as the economic activity came to a grinding halt.

The government has so far announced income and food support to the vulnerable people as part of a Rs 1.70 lakh crore fiscal stimulus to the economic, financial and possibly humanitarian crisis, and is also mulling a second round of measures soon.

The US has seen a huge spike in unemployment as over 26 million people have claimed for state support because of losing their jobs. Experts often rue the absence of a good gauge of jobs in India, which is predominantly an unorganised-sector led economy.

CMIE’s weekly series of data pointed to a steady increase in unemployment since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, with the week to March 29 showing the sharpest spike to 23.81%.

As per CMIE’s data, the monthly unemployment rate in April stood at 23.52%, up from March’s 8.74%.

As of the end of April, Puducherry in South India had the highest number of unemployment at 75.8%, followed by neighbouring Tamil Nadu 49.8%, Jharkhand 47.1% and Bihar 46.6%.

Maharashtra’s unemployment rate was pegged at 20.9% by the CMIE, while the same for Haryana stood at 43.2%, Uttar Pradesh at 21.5% and Karnataka at 29.8%.

Hilly states had the lowest incidence of unemployment as of April, the think tank said, pointing out that the rate in Himachal Pradesh stood at 2.2%, Sikkim at 2.3% and Uttarakhand at 6.5%."
Facebook India Managing Director Steps Down,https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/facebook-india-managing-director-quits,"Feb 13, 2016  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: With the dust barely settling around net neutrality in India, the head of Facebook’s India operations has announced that she will step down from her job in the near future and will relocate to the United States.

In a Facebook post put out on Friday, Facebook India Managing Director Kirthiga Reddy points out that when she first moved out to India in order to set up and expand the social networking service’s reach within the country, she knew that she would return to the US eventually.

“When my family relocated to India, we knew that we would move back to the US some day. It’s a bittersweet moment to share that the return timeframe is coming up in the next 6-12 months. Our two daughters start high school and middle school this coming year— which serves as a natural transition point to make this move back,” she says in the post.

“I could not be more excited about where the Facebook business is in India, where we are going and what’s to come. Over the last six years, starting as the first employee for Facebook in India, I have had the privilege to be part of our amazing growth journey.”

While Ms. Reddy’s accomplishments are indeed deserving of applause, she has single-handedly set up Facebook’s corporate base and expanded the company’s user count, her tenure comes to an end at a time when Facebook is currently the source of much negative media attention. The company’s Internet access initiative Free Basics has stirred up controversy, was widely criticized and was eventually banned by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India a few days ago.

It is unclear, however, at this point whether Ms. Reddy’s departure is linked to the fiasco surrounding Free Basics. According to her post, she plans on closely working with two top Facebook executives to search for her successor and continue to look for new opportunities back at Facebook’s headquarters in the US.

The negative press surrounding Free Basics and consequent brick-bats have not gotten to Ms. Reddy apparently. In her concluding lines, she obliquely refers to the controversy and writes: “Above all, it’s been about our mission: Give the people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. We have only just begun”.

Update: 8:53 AM, February 13th, 2016

In a statement to Reuters, A Facebook company spokesperson has sought to distance Ms. Reddy from Free Basics by stating that she wasn’t involved in the roll-out of the service.

“As she had planned for some time, Kirthiga Reddy is moving back to the U.S. to work with the teams in Headquarters,” a Facebook spokesperson said. “During her time in India, Kirthiga was not involved in our Free Basic Services efforts.”

It Is Time to Address India's Abysmal Job Creation Record,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/india-abysmal-job-creation-record,"Nov 25, 2016  |  Pradeep S. Mehta and Amol Kulkarni","More than 550 jobs were lost each day in the last four years in India, placing it behind Bangladesh and Vietnam in terms of job creation.

The sheer pressure of poverty means that job creation will always be high on the agenda of any government. In India, significant public resources have been invested to encash the demographic dividend and prevent it from becoming a burden. But the results have been far from desirable for several reasons. The unemployment rate has touched 5%, a five-year high, and around 35% of the working population is under-employed. Fewer jobs are being added to the economy with each passing year. When compared to other countries, India’s performance on job creation has been abysmal. Our rate of job creation is half that of Vietnam. In fact, it has been suggested that 550 jobs were lost every day in the last four years.

Before considering the possible strategies on job creation for India, it is necessary to consider the emerging political and economic strains in both the local and the global context, within which job-creation strategies will operate.

Recent trends suggest a dwindling potential for manufacturing. But the government is pursuing a manufacturing-led job creation strategy. Experts in NITI Aayog suggest emulating China is still possible. China built its export-led growth on massive infrastructure investment, which facilitated easy access to power, water, transport and information infrastructure. While India is gradually improving on these counts, replicating the China story will be difficult, given the differences in social and political milieu of the two countries, as well as changed global scenarios.

Putting all eggs in one basket (that is, export) and depending on trade will be naive, considering the increasingly uncertain global political environment wherein benefits of free trade and liberalisation are being increasingly questioned with complex social forces becoming an important determinant. A new conservative world order might be in offing as Donald Trump starts preparing to take over as president of the US early next year.

Large-scale industries that have mainly driven growth and employment domestically as well as in other countries have been fueled by traditional energy sources like fossil fuels such as coal and gas. Continuous reliance on fossil fuels and faith in non-renewable energy fed success stories along with hope for their revival and repetition, will be undesirable in a sustainability conscious world. This will also be antithetical to the commitments made by the Indian government at several international forums to reduce the domestic carbon footprint. It will also adversely impact our chances to lead the global transition to clean energy.

Economists like Dani Rodrik point out that emerging economies are experiencing premature de-industrialisation and will reach their peak in industrial production sooner than expected. One of the reasons is automation. It is taking away the advantage of traditional low cost manufacturing hubs, which are being relocated near the consumers to enable customisation and cut delivery cost. For instance, Adidas and Reebok intend to open robot assisted customised manufacturing units in Germany and the US.

The World Bank predicts that the proportion of jobs threatened by automation in India, China and Ethiopia, is 69%, 77% and 85%, respectively. Raymond Industries has recently announced plans for replacing one third of its workforce in India by robots. Furthermore, a paucity of strategy in dealing with such emerging threats makes us vulnerable.

And while automation is more of a recent phenomenon, deeper analysis points to the yawning gap in skills of those entering the job market. The Global Competitiveness Report highlights India’s miserable performance on indicators like technological readiness, higher education, training and skill development. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka perform better than India on financial market development. Our performance is poor by global standards on indicators like life expectancy (rank 106) or even infant mortality (rank 115), pointing to a failure of the public health system. The World Economic Forum Report on global gender gap reveals that on the indicator of women’s health, India is third last. Similarly, on the global hunger index, India lies among the bottom group of countries, even below neighbours like Nepal, Myanmar and Bangladesh.

Given that hitherto pursued strategies have achieved less than desirable results and that the domestic and global contexts have become more complicated than ever before, what corrective strategy should be pursued to realise the elusive job creation dream?

Designing a forward looking strategy

It is becoming increasingly difficult to predict the nature of jobs that will be required in the future and the role of manufacturing in job creation. History tells us that while the industrial revolution and technological advancements in the past abolished certain types of jobs, it also created others. Such is the hope with automation as well. However, the industries will only be able to list its current requirements and might not be able to predict what the future holds. Remember, no one could have predicted that thee-commerce sector and aggregator platforms will be able to generate significant direct and indirect jobs.

A forward looking strategy on job creation could incorporate certain elements, though they need not be limited to them. Private sector participation can be encouraged, for instance. The government has hitherto carried the burden of designing a job creation strategy, provide higher education and training and act as chief provider of skills. The time is now ripe to actively engage the private sector to share this burden, which must be henceforth viewed as an opportunity.

To this end, education, skill development and training need to be treated as self-sustaining industries wherein the government and private sector can compete and collaborate to satisfy the increasing and varied demands of prospective employers, employees and entrepreneurs in areas like education, skills, certification and job matching. One can already witness a lot of private sector interest and innovation in these areas. LinkedIn has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the government on job creation.

Private sector participation is expected to increasingly become relevant for meeting the continuously changing demand of industries and to help individuals engage in ‘life-long learning’. Experts like Arun Maira argue that human beings are the only ‘appreciating assets’ of an enterprise whose value can increase over time as they learn. Therefore, employers would do well to ‘humanise’ their enterprises and not only ‘digitise’ them, and contribute to their value appreciation, by facilitating continuous learning and skill development.

The government should not view such innovation and private sector involvement in politically sensitive areas with suspicion. On the contrary, it must promote such industries and engage in smart regulation of such multi-sided markets. The traditional approach of controlling entry and preventing dominance will not work. Regulation would need to be based on stakeholder consultation and continuously evolve with the markets. Participation and interaction between stakeholders must be promoted and abuse should be checked.

A significant population is moving away from agriculture to other lucrative employment opportunities, resulting in migration and increased pressure on potential urban growth centres. There is a need to make agriculture and rural non-farm sectors attractive again. Mechanisation and technology advancement could help. Successful experiments in Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and other states exist wherein large farmers employ rural youth to run custom hiring centres which rent out machinery, like tractors, threshers, seed drills, harvesters and cultivators to small and marginal farmers, thus increasing their productivity. Availability of low cost technologies like seed grading machines can open avenues for non-farm employment, such as production and sale of certified seeds. Such experiments need to be scaled up and geographically expanded. States like Rajasthan have taken the cue and are making admirable efforts. Continuous regulatory reforms in factor markets are also needed to jump-start growth and enable Indian agriculture to participate in the global agriculture value chains.

As large industries start moving towards automated ways of production; micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) will become more relevant than ever before to provide jobs to the semi-skilled and unskilled. While the government is pursuing several reforms to facilitate such businesses – like enabling access to credit and ensuring timely payments of receivables to MSMEs – it seems that relatively larger corporations are benefitting from such schemes. Smaller enterprises are still grappling with traditional challenges like land use conversion, getting necessary operational approvals, dealing with incompetent and corrupt government officials at entry and mid-levels. It is extremely important to ensure that reforms reach their intended beneficiaries. The government and civil society will need to come together to generate awareness about schemes designed to benefit SMEs and address supply side constraints by building the capacity of mid and entry level government officers, monitoring their performance and fixing accountability.

The government must also try to identify niche areas that are capable of being leveraged. Evidence suggests that successful economies identify niche areas, build necessary expertise and create necessary hard and soft infrastructure to create jobs. This is a continuous process as economies move up the value chain, acquire new skills and improve existing infrastructure. For instance, China started with export of labour intensive products such as apparel, footwear and toys. With rising skill endowments, it moved to more sophisticated assembly operations such as office machinery, telecommunications and electrical machinery, as a part of global supply chain. The International Monetary Fund notes that China is now moving up the value chain, ‘on shoring’ the production of higher-value-added upstream products and moving into more sophisticated downstream products as well. At the same time, with its wages rising, it has started to exit some lower-end, more labour-intensive sectors.

This evolution in the Chinese economy has provided opportunities to low-wage, low-income countries, such as, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. All these are open economies and are highly integrated with China, and thus are naturally placed to fill the spot emptied by China. In addition, countries like Bangladesh have created their own expertise in sectors such as apparel.

India also needs to identify its own niche areas capable of being leveraged for job creation. We have traditionally been sound in software and technology services sector. Perhaps it is time to leverage such expertise in allied, emerging themes in technology to generate unskilled and semi-skilled jobs. An entire ecosystem could be built around technology enabled sectors which could include jobs in manufacturing, assembling, packaging, sales, delivery, installation, repairing and the like.

NASSCOM recently noted that India aims to capture 20% market share in Internet of Things sector, worth US$300bn. Concurrent investment in infrastructure, skill development, awareness generation, research and development would be required to enable this sector realise its potential. Regulations will need to be attuned to facilitate the growth of technology driven industries. Policies like the technology upgradation fund will need to be reviewed in this light. Tools like ‘regulatory impact assessment’ and ‘regulatory sandbox’ should be adopted to get the policy and regulatory framework right in increasingly tested areas.

The government also needs to rethink its approach for the informal sector. It has been pointed out that over the years, while ‘labour saving’ technologies have grown, ‘labour linking’ technologies are also on rise. With decent electricity and internet connection, individuals in emerging economies can provide services to global corporations. Several customised platforms on the internet have emerged (aggregators, e-commerce players) which link demand and supply, thus creating direct and indirect employment. Such contractual jobs are akin to informal employment, which is no longer a ‘dirty word’, and has been rechristened as ‘gig’ economy. With the rise of gig economies, the government can no longer treat the informal sector as undesirable. It will need to revisit policies aimed at transitioning the informal sector to the formal sector. However, there is still a need to understand the constraints for growth (and not necessarily formalisation) of informal enterprises and provide them support to become ‘future ready’. Singapore recently announced a new industry transformation programme from which certain ideas could be borrowed.

In addition to the rise of ‘gig’ economies, there is an immense global pressure to replace conventional sources of energy with greener energy sources. This would require the development of new skill sets in environment management and the emergence of novel service providers. It has been reported that renewable energy technologies are generally more labour-intensive than more mechanised fossil fuel technologies and can provide a tremendous opportunity to create local jobs for a young and growing workforce. For instance, experts suggest that the government’s push in solar energy could generate close to 1.1 mn jobs in construction, project management and design, business development and operations and maintenance, in next half a decade. Smaller size projects can generate more jobs in hydel sector as well. It has been estimated that the wind energy sector also has the potential to create significant jobs in construction, transportation, operations, maintenance and other areas.

The focus on sustainable development should prompt the government to think about policies to incentivise environment protection and preservation and perhaps treat it as non-farm entrepreneurship. Economies like Costa Rica and Uganda have experimented with programmes like payments for environment services and offer some examples for India to learn from. With support from the World Bank, the Democratic Republic of Congo has recently designed the first-of-its-kind, large-scale programme to curb forest loss and to improve the livelihoods of indigenous peoples and local communities. In Mozambique, an integrated portfolio of forest and landscape investments is helping to generate jobs and improve food security for rural communities. Research is also required to upscale green solutions which do not compromise industrial competitiveness and provide quick returns on investments.

Waste management needs to be a crucial component of an inclusive and sustainable development agenda. With increasing use of electronic items and limited avenues for disposal, e-waste collection, management, and disposal could be another area having the potential to create low skilled jobs. Specific skills could also be required for diverting organic waste from the landfill or incineration, reuse of recycled materials, and generating energy from waste. Such new avenues of job creation must be identified and promoted.

It will also be useful to begin thinking about concepts like targeted universal basic income to help individuals tide over phases of unemployment and gain new skills. The success of the universal identity card (Aadhar) experiment in India, it’s seeding into bank accounts and transfer of direct benefits must motivate the government to transfer higher income to the poor which can be linked with access to high quality education and health services. Such targeted basic income must replace inefficient subsidies. Access to such services will go a long way in preparing the poor in dealing with employment related uncertainties in the future.

There can be no straight answer to job creation. A multi-pronged dynamic and decentralised approach needs to be developed and implemented in collaboration with diverse stakeholders, such as the government, industries, academia, civil society, experts and media. Such multi-stakeholder alliances must discuss and debate politically, technically and commercially feasible ideas to deal with the challenges which the economy of tomorrow brings with it, job creation being the chief amongst them.

Five Indian Mujahideen Operatives Sentenced to Death for Hyderabad Blasts,https://m.thewire.in/article/uncategorised/5-im-operatives-sentenced-to-death-in-hyderabad-blasts,"Dec 20, 2016  |  PTI","NIA special public prosecutor K. Surender said the court, after going through their evidence, found that the case is based on facts.

“As per investigation evidence that is placed on record clearly reflects that the five IM members planned and executed the bomb blasts. We sought capital punishment (for the convicts) and accordingly the court gave death penalty to them,” he said.

The prosecutor described the verdict as a “victory” for NIA’s investigation and the witnesses.

The court, after hearing the arguments of the prosecution and defence counsels on sentencing, awarded death penalty to the convicts and also varying jail terms on different counts, including waging war against the Government of India and commission of terrorist act.

On December 13, the court had convicted the five operatives – IM co-founder Mohd Ahmed Sidibapa alias Yasin Bhatkal, Pakistani national Zia-ur-Rahman alias Waqas, Asadullah Akhtar alias Haddi, Tahaseen Akhtar alias Monu and Ajaz Shaikh – who are at present in judicial custody and lodged in the Cherlapally Central Prison here.

The IM convicts said they will go for an appeal, according to the NIA counsel.

All relevant records will be submitted in the high court for confirmation of the death sentence, Surender said.

Eighteen people were killed and 131 injured in two deadly explosions in Dilsukhnagar, a crowded shopping area in the city, on February 21, 2013.

On November 7, the final arguments had concluded in the case before the special court.

Since IM founder Riyaz Bhatkal, the prime accused in the case, is absconding, the trial was split up against him.

The court convicted Yasin Bhatkal and others under various sections of Indian Penal Code, Arms Act, Unlawful Activities Prevention Act .

According to NIA, Riyaz Bhatkal arranged for explosive substances and directed Asadullah Akhtar and Zia-ur-Rahman at Mangalore to receive the same."

"SC Stays States' Ban on 'Padmaavat', Allows it to Be Screened Across India",https://m.thewire.in/article/film/sc-stays-states-ban-padmaavat-allows-screened-across-india,"Jan 18, 2018  |  PTI","New Delhi: The Supreme Court today cleared the decks for the all-India release of Padmaavat on January 25 and stayed notifications and orders issued by Rajasthan and Gujarat prohibiting exhibition of the film in their states.

A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra also restrained any other state from issuing such notifications and orders prohibiting exhibition of the movie.

The bench, also comprising Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud observed that the states are obliged to maintain law and order.

“We direct that there shall be a stay of operation on the notification and orders issued and we also restrain other states from issuing such notifications or orders in this matter,” the bench said in its interim order.

Senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, representing Viacom 18 and other producers of the movie, told the bench that states have no power to issue such notifications banning the exhibition of a film when the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has given a certificate of release.

The bench has posted the matter for further hearing in March.

The producers had approached the top court challenging the notification and orders issued by four states, all BJP-ruled – Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh – prohibiting exhibition of the film.

During the hearing today, additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing Rajasthan, Gujarat and Haryana, informed the bench that notification and order has been issued by the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan only.

The governments of Haryana, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan had declared that they will not allow screening of the movie, which stars Deepika Padukone, Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer Singh in lead roles.

The producers submitted that the movie has undergone changes including in its title as suggested by the CBFC.

Asserting that the film has been cleared by the CBFC, the plea has said that the states cannot impose a blanket ban on a film and its screening can be suspended in a particular area or areas on account of law and order problem, not across the states.

Politicians of all hues, including some chief ministers, recently made public statements on the film, with many of them coming out against it.

The film is based on the saga of the historic battle of the 13th century between Maharaja Ratan Singh and his army of Mewar and Sultan Alauddin Khilji of Delhi.

The set of the movie was vandalised twice – in Jaipur and Kolhapur, while its director Sanjay Leela Bhansali was roughed up by members of the Karni Sena last year."

The organisation claimed the censorship imposed on the Hindi channel by the government was reminiscent of the Emergency and demanded an immediate withdrawal of the ban.

The Editors Guild of India (EGI) on Friday strongly criticised the one-day ban imposed by the government on NDTV India and demanded that the decision be rescinded.

The government on Thursday had ordered the Hindi channel be shut down on November 9 for its alleged revealing of “strategically sensitive” details during its coverage of the Pathankot attacks and followed the recommendation of an inter-ministerial committee instituted by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

According to Hindustan Times, the committee had found the channel guilty of violating the broadcast norms by relaying information that could impact national security.

In a statement issued by the EGI, the organisation said that the ban on NDTV was “a direct violation of the freedom of the media,” and thus amounted to “harsh censorship imposed by the government [which was] reminiscent of the Emergency.”

The EGI added that by doing so the government had entrusted itself with the “power to intervene in the functioning of the media” and take punitive actions when it failed to agree with the coverage.

According to the statement, NDTV has maintained that its coverage was “sober,” was in the “public domain” and was not different from any information that had been covered by the rest of the media.

The organisation, in asking for an “immediate withdrawal of the ban,” added there were legal provisions available to both the Centre and the state to take actions against any “irresponsible media coverage.”

The channel has the option to appeal the order before a tribunal and in a statement issued Thursday night the Hindi channel called the ban an attack on media freedom and stated that “After the dark days of the Emergency when the press was fettered, it is extraordinary that NDTV is being proceeded against in this manner.”

This is the first time such an order has been issued against a TV channel over its coverage of a terror attack under norms which were notified last year."

New Delhi: India and the US on Thursday held the first edition of the twice-deferred two-plus-two talks, covering the entire expanse of the bilateral ties and looking to further expand their global strategic cooperation, including in the Indo-Pacific region.

External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman held the talks with US secretary of state Michael R. Pompeo and defence secretary James Mattis.

In her opening remarks, Swaraj said she was confident that the talks will help unleash the untapped potential of the relationship between the two nations and further elevate the level of engagement.

She said there has been significant progress in all key areas of cooperation between the two countries.

In his remarks, Pompeo said both sides should continue to ensure freedom of the seas and work towards peaceful resolutions of maritime disputes.

He also stressed on promoting market-based economics and good governance.

“Our two nations are united by shared values of democracy, respect for individual rights and a shared commitment to freedom,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Swaraj and Sitharaman held separate meetings with Pompeo and Mattis respectively.

Official sources said a number of key bilateral issues were discussed during the meetings.

External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar called the meeting between Swaraj and Pompeo a “productive” engagement.

He said the two sides took stock of “impressive strides” in the bilateral relationship and discussed steps to take the relationship to an “even higher trajectory”.

Both Pompeo and Mattis arrived here on Wednesday for the inaugural Indo-US two-plus-two talks, which was finalised during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington last year.

In a special gesture, Swaraj received secretary Pompeo at the airport here yesterday while Sitharaman welcomed secretary Mattis, reflecting the importance India attaches to their visit here.

The officials said the focus of the two-plus-two talks will be to deepen global strategic partnership between the two countries and resolve differences over India’s defence engagement with Russia and crude oil import from Iran.

The two sides may also deliberate on a proposed pact on encrypted defence technologies and on ways to boost counter-terror cooperation."
Consular Access to 117 of 126 Indian Students Detained in US Obtained: MEA,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/consular-access-to-117-of-126-indian-students-detained-in-us-obtained-legal-help-being-given-mea,"Feb 06, 2019  |  PTI","New Delhi: India said Tuesday it has obtained consular access to 117 of the 129 Indian students detained in the US for enrolling in a fake university and legal assistance was being extended to them.

The Indian government has continued to closely monitor and take proactive measures to deal with the detention of Indian students, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.

According to US government statistics, 129 Indians were administratively arrested as on January 31 in connection with their enrolment at the “university”.

“As on date, our embassy and consulates have obtained consular access to 117 of them, by pro-actively visiting 36 different detention sites through the length and breadth of the country,” the MEA said.

Efforts for consular access to the remaining 12 are continuing, including through the 24/7 helpline set up by the Indian embassy and outreach to the community, it said.

Assistance is being extended to the Indian students in obtaining legal advice and connecting them to community support services, the MEA said.

“We remain in touch with the US authorities, both at the federal and local level, to ensure and satisfy ourselves about humane and dignified treatment of the Indian students and custom-sensitive dietary and living arrangement for them during the period of their detention,” the statement said.

It said the government continues to attach high priority to the well-being of the detained students and will remain constantly engaged with US authorities and other stakeholders.

The ministry’s statement came after the US State Department said all 130 foreign students, including 129 Indians, detained in the US for enrolling in a fake university, were aware that they were committing a crime to fraudulently remain in the country.

The State Department’s response came after India issued a demarche to the American embassy in New Delhi on Saturday, expressing its concern over the detention of Indian students and sought immediate consular access to them.

The foreign students were arrested last week by the US Department of Homeland Security for enrolling at the University of Farmington allegedly to remain in America.

The fake university was set up by DHS’s investigating unit in Greater Detroit area to bust the “pay-and-stay” racket.

Eight individuals either Indian citizens or Indian-Americans have been arrested for running the racket. They have pleaded “not guilty” before a federal court in Michigan."

Modi Addresses Nation: 'Jammu and Kashmir Will Now See Economic Development and Integration',https://m.thewire.in/article/government/narendra-modi-address,"Aug 09, 2019  |  The Wire Staff","On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation for the first time since his government announced that it would be reading down Article 370, which took away the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories. Without referring to the communications blackout, the protests or the Section 144 clampdown in the region, Modi made a plea for development and better governance in the Union Territories, indicating a de-facto explanation for the Centre’s twin decisions.

The Union Territories would be governed directly by the Centre, which would bring development, including, he said, the film industry which could use Jammu and Kashmir for shooting movies.

Modi began his speech with a clear focus on Article 370. He congratulated his “brothers and sisters” – the residents of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. “Article 370 had been keeping Jammu and Kashmir from the path of development. People were not able to say what good this article and Article 35A were doing to the state,” he said.

As many as 42,000 people died as a result of the this provision, the prime minister said, adding that it had become little more than a weapon in the hands of Pakistan.

Whenever a law is brought, there is strife, he said. “But no one could have imagined that a law could be brought for the entire nation. The previous government did not realise that the laws it was bringing could be implemented in Jammu and Kashmir too,” Modi said.

He then went on to give several examples of how the rest of India’s children, girls and safai karmacharis enjoy laws implemented countrywide, but people in Jammu and Kashmir do not. Among other examples of markers of equality he highlighted were the reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in elections.

Modi said that the Centre would offer benefits of house rent allowance, children’s education allowance, health schemes, and so on to government workers and police personnel of Jammu and Kashmir. He gave examples of how jobs will be created, vacancies filled and industries brought to the region now.

From AIIMS, IITs to railways, the region would be in for a facelift, the prime minister said. This, he stressed, was a realisation the Centre came to after allowing governor’s rule in the state in the past few months.

Modi also talked of the electoral culture in the Valley, and said wrongs had been done to people in the state through a lack of governance. He said people in Jammu and Kashmir would now be able to elect their own chief ministers and electors. “They will come from you,” he said, adding that if the situation is found to be conducive, then the Centre may even remove the Union Territory from under its control in due course.

“Ladakh, however, will remain under the Centre,” he said.

Modi also said he wished that the people of the region will begin to hope anew. “I have full belief that they will aim for better lives for themselves,” he said, adding that the system had, until now, not given youth in the state an opportunity to take up leadership posts.

Modi spoke for how the film industry and technology had much to contribute to employment of Jammu and Kashmir youths. He touched upon various sectors which could bring about economic development, including sports, for the young of Kashmir.

The prime minister listed delicacies and geographically-specific fauna from the region, which he said, “should be shared with the world.” Through the process, Modi stressed, farming and food processing would be amped.

Modi devoted several minutes to Ladakh in particular, making the case for awaited overall development in the region.

He then came to criticisms his government has received over the decision. “I respect the decisions. It is the Centre’s responsibility to answer criticisms. I request everyone to help the government and country in ensuring Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh in going forward,” he said.

Modi seemed to warn against politicking in the matter, and said he was not concerned with who voted for or against the motion to read down Article 370 in the parliament.

“I assure people in Jammu and Kashmir that slowly, slowly, the situation will return to normal,” he said.

He also wished people on the occasion of Eid. “The government is keen on ensuring that celebrations of Eid are not hampered in the region,” he added, congratulating security forces and government officials on “the excellent work they are doing” in maintaining peace in the region.

Listing another example of the region’s overall integration with the rest of India, Modi listed out the names of martyrs from Jammu and Kashmir who had been decorated with bravery awards given out by the Centre.

At around 2:30 pm, the prime minister’s office tweeted that the address would be at 8 pm. Speculation had been rife as to what Modi could speak about.

Most rumours on social media centred around the fact that the time was ripe for the prime minister to make a speech on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. The government has been keen to propagate the idea that the situation is peaceful in the region since Monday’s decision to water down Article 370 and bifurcate the state into two was announced.

Minutes before the prime minister began his address, ANI reported that around 70 “terrorists and hardcore pro-Pakistan separatists from Kashmir valley have been shifted to Agra in a special plane provided by the Indian Air Force.”

Protests have continued against the Centre’s decision.

The prime minister, on August 6, spoke in great praise of Union home minister Amit Shah’s speech at the parliament, during the course of which he presented the proposal for the scrapping of Article 370."
The Growing Irrelevance of the Budget,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/the-growing-irrelevance-of-the-budget,"Mar 04, 2016  |  Prem Shankar Jha","Jaitley’s effort included many significant policy plans but had little to offer on reviving economic growth. Unless interest rates are lowered sharply, there is no possibility of recovery.

The Budget presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday contains a number of new departures that merit unstinting praise. Chief of these are a national crop insurance scheme for farmers, a health insurance scheme to protect families from the impact of illnesses that incapacitate the breadwinner and a three-year programme to provide 50 million families in villages with cooking gas facilities.

But on the revival of economic growth, the central challenge facing the country today, the Budget has little to offer. Instead, Jaitley implicitly absolved the government of responsibility for it’s failure to revive growth, by laying the blame on the “serious crisis” in the global economy but said the Indian economy held its ground despite the global headwinds.

The bad debt problem

The self praise, however, is muted. Both the Budget and the Economic Survey have admitted that all is far from well in the economy. The 2014-15 Survey had estimated that 880,000 crore rupees of investment was locked up in stalled projects, concentrated mostly in the heavy industry, construction and infrastructure sectors, and this year’s Survey dealt at length on the mountain of bad debt that this has created in the banking system. On December 31, 2015 the non performing assets (NPAs) – debt on which banks are not able to recover their interest and amortisation – of 24 listed public sector banks, including the State Bank of India and its associates, stood at a whopping 3,93,035 crore rupees, or about 11% of their loans. Private banks had not done much better; although they accounted for less than 20% of outstanding loans, their NPAs added up to 45,000 crore rupees.

This mounting bad debt has reduced banks’ willingness and capacity to lend, slowed the growth of credit to less than half of what it was during its heyday a decade ago and locked the entire secondary economy in the jaws of stagnation. Not surprisingly, industrial growth has been stuck at just over 3% for the last five years. This is close to 2% lower than the growth it recorded in the 1960s and 1970s, during the worst period of the closed economy. Judging from the quarterly data collected by the labour ministry, the slowdown in the growth of employment has been equally sharp.

It is in suggesting a remedy for the crisis that North Block is strangely reticent. Both the Economic Survey and the Budget reflect the conviction that the remedy lies in drastically simplifying and speeding up the procedure for declaring firms bankrupt and liquidating their assets. The Survey has likened the Indian economy to the Chakravyuha in the Mahabharata – easy to get into but very hard to get out of. Enabling companies to exit easily will release what Joseph Schumpeter called “the gales of creative destruction,” for it will free land, buildings and other assets for sale, and bring the capital locked in them back into useful circulation. Citing academic studies, the Survey has claimed that this will improve the productivity of capital by 30-40% and trigger an economic revival.

Jaitley has taken his cue from the Economic Survey. In paras 90-94 of his Budget speech he unveiled a spate of measures that will make it easier to set up asset reconstruction companies, to speed up the working of debt recovery tribunals by digitising the collection of information and recapitalise public sector banks in order to free up the flow of credit.

Persistence of widespread insolvency

It was these announcements that sent the Sensex up by 800 points, the biggest one-day increase in seven years. But as a panacea for economic stagnation they will not suffice, for implicit in them is the belief that investment is going bad mainly because of the greed of investors who borrow too much and therefore run up very high interest costs, and because of cronyism and unprofessionalism in the management of public sector banks.

These are not the only, or even the main, causes of the malaise in the economy. One key indicator is the large number of companies with restructured loans that have once again become insolvent. In 2014-15, 57,000 crore rupees of restructured loans had gone bad, double the amount from the previous year.

The persistence of widespread insolvency despite the restructuring of debt shows that its cause is not episodic but systemic. Every single one of the economy’s problems can be traced back to the very high interest rate regime that has existed, with one short interlude, since 2007. This has drastically reduced demand by discouraging purchases made on instalment plans, including the purchases of housing and office space, automobiles, electronic and digital equipment, and home and office furnishings. These make up almost half of industrial production. It has also caused a collapse of the share market in all but a few sectors and a virtual disappearance of initial public offerings of shares since 2007. Finally, it has forced promoters to rely almost exclusively on bank loans to finance investment just when the cost of borrowing has gone up. This has greatly increased the risk of investment and is responsible for the large scale abandonment of infrastructure and heavy industrial projects that were highlighted in the 2014-15 Economic Survey.

The interest rate quagmire

Jaitley has urged the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to lower interest rates on several occasions, and in July his chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramaniam, wrote an article in The Indian Express arguing that the cost of living index is no longer a satisfactory measure of inflation and urged the use of the GDP deflator instead. It is thus surprising that Jaitley did not say anything in his Budget speech about lowering interest rates, a point left out in the Economic Survey too.

This may be out of respect for the RBI’s autonomy in determining monetary policy. But central bank chief Raghuram Rajan has shown no inclination to lower the interest rate so far as he believes, with the cost of living index still averaging 5%, the RBI’s current policy rates – ranging 7.75-5.75% – are already low enough in real terms not to merit much further reduction. Additionally, he firmly believes that most of the problems of industry can be traced back to the mistakes of the promoters, who “do not have a divine right to stay in charge regardless of how badly they mismanage an enterprise, nor … have the right to use the banking system to recapitalize their failed ventures”.

But the RBI’s policy rates do not reflect the actual cost of borrowing. Today the average borrowing rate, including various bank charges, is over 11%. With inflation, measured by the GDP deflator, close to zero the real rate of interest for borrowers is prohibitive. Till it is brought down, and that too very sharply, there is no possibility of a revival of investment and an economic recovery.

The real test for the government will therefore come when the RBI announces its next policy review at the end of this month. If Rajan does not bring down interest rates substantially, Jaitley and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have to choose between foregoing economic recovery or foregoing the services of Rajan. The choice, either way, will not be easy.

The eight core industries in August contracted to over three-and-half year low of 0.5%, due to decline in output of coal, crude oil, natural gas, cement, and electricity, according to a government data released on Monday.

The eight core sector industries – coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertiliser, steel, cement and electricity – had expanded by 4.7% in August last year.

The previous low was recorded at (-) 1.3 in November 2015.

Coal, crude oil, natural gas, cement, and electricity recorded a negative growth of 8.6%, 5.4%, 3.9%, 4.9% and 2.9%, respectively, in August, according to the data of the commerce and industry ministry.

However, fertiliser and steel production grew by 2.9%, and 5%, respectively, during the month under review.

Growth rate in the production of refinery products dipped by 2.6% in August this year as against 5.1% in the same month last year.

During April-August, growth in the eight core industries grew by 2.4% from 5.7% in the year-ago period.

Commenting on the data, rating firm Icra Ltd said: “The performance of the core sectors in August 2019 was disappointingly weak, with a broad-based deterioration in six of the eight constituents and as many as five sectors recording a year-on-year contraction in that month”.

The contraction in the core sector growth in August 2019 confirms the view that the modest pickup in the IIP growth in July did not signal the start of an industrial recovery, it added in a statement."
Vyapam Lawyer Indira Jaising Is Barred From Attending Bhopal Event,https://m.thewire.in/article/government/vyapam-lawyer-indira-jaising-is-barred-from-attending-bhopal-event,"Dec 16, 2015  |  Gaurav Vivek Bhatnagar","Senior advocate and rights activist Indira Jaising on Tuesday accused the Madhya Pradesh Government of vendetta after she was denied permission to attend the inaugural session of a workshop at the National Law Institute University (NLIU) in Bhopal, for which she had already reached the city. Jaising charged that the refusal had much to do with her appearance for petitioners seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the Vyapam recruitment and admissions scam.

Jaising, who is also the former Additional Solicitor General, had reached Bhopal on an invitation to attend the two-day workshop on “Gender sensitization and capacity building training on sexual harassment of women at work places”, which had been jointly organized by UN Women, the government of Madhya Pradesh and the NGO Lawyers Collective and NLIU.

When Jaising reached the University for the session at 10-30 a.m., the organizers prevented her from going inside, saying the State Government has not provided the “clearances on her name” for the event. At this, she left the venue, but not before making her displeasure known.

“I think it is because of my appearance in Vyapam,” she told The Wire. The meeting went ahead as scheduled.

Attitude condemned

Talking to the local media, Jaising said, “I condemn this attitude as an attack on the right of clients to legal representation”. She said though the Lawyers Collective, of which she was a trustee, appreciates the efforts of the State Government in spreading awareness of the law, the refusal to allow her to speak the was linked to her appearing for the petitioners.

The organizers defended their actions claiming it was only a “matter of coordination”. Dr Raka Arya, chairman of Gender and Health Loss at NLIU, was quoted as saying that “there was a delay in communication, nothing else.” There was no clarification about what this communication was. Nor were the organizers or the government forthcoming on why Jaising was stopped from entering an event that had no connection with the Vyapam issue.

The senior advocate is representing the petitioners – including former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh — in the Vyapam scam in both the High Court and Supreme Court. She has been appearing in the case along with other senior advocates like KTS Tulsi, Vivek Thanka, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal. She described the decision as a government backlash for her stand in the matter."
Pakistan Cancels Indian Envoy Ajay Bisaria's Lecture in Lahore,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/pakistan-cancels-indian-envoy-ajay-bisarias-lecture-in-lahore,"Oct 05, 2018  |  PTI","Lahore: Amidst the chill in bilateral ties, Pakistan cancelled, at the last minute, Indian envoy Ajay Bisaria’s scheduled lecture at a training institute in Lahore for not taking prior permission from the Foreign Office, according to sources.

An official privy to the development told PTI on Friday that Indian High Commissioner Bisaria was invited by the National School of Public Policy (NSPP) to deliver a lecture on Thursday.

The institution that imparts training to civil servants invites academicians, professionals and dignitaries for guest lectures on a regular basis.

“The NSPP Lahore had invited Mr Bisaria for the guest lecture for October 4 but the Indian High Commission was informed that his lecture has been cancelled. The commission will be informed on re-scheduling of his lecture,” he said.

Sources further informed that the NSPP management had to cancel Bisaria’s lecture after receiving orders from the top.

“The management was told that in case of inviting any ambassador for a guest lecture, at least permission is required from the Foreign Office, he said.

Earlier, Bisaria was also stopped from visiting Gurdwara Punja Sahib in Hasan Abdal. The Pakistani government had claimed that Bisaria was stopped from visiting the gurdwara because of security reasons as Sikh yatris from India did not want to meet him.

The ties between the two countries had strained after the terror attacks by Pakistan-based groups in 2016 and India’s surgical strikes inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Last month, India called off a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries in New York, citing the brutal killings of three policemen in Jammu and Kashmir and Islamabad releasing postage stamps “glorifying” Kashmiri militant Burhan Wani.

Pakistan yesterday said that the opening of the Kartarpur border crossing for Sikh pilgrims was linked with the start of dialogue between India and Pakistan.

"As Maldives Lifts Emergency, India Calls It a 'First Step' to Reinstating Rule of Law",https://m.thewire.in/article/south-asia/maldives-lifts-emergency-india-calls-it-a-first-step,"Mar 23, 2018  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India has given a muted welcome to the lifting of the state of emergency in Maldives, described it as a “first step” towards restoration of a credible political process before the presidential elections and implementing the Supreme Court’s February 1 order.

On Thursday, Maldives president Abdulla Yameen announced that the state of emergency has been lifted. The emergency would have anyway lapsed on Thursday night as the period of its validity of 45 days would have comes to an end.

“We welcome the revocation of the state of emergency in the Maldives. While this is one step towards addressing the issues related to the prevailing political situation in that country, a number of concerns expressed by the international community still remain to be addressed,” the press release issued by Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday evening said.

Significantly, India has called upon Maldives to implement the February 1 order of the Supreme Court which triggered the events leading to president Yameen declaring a state of emergency.

We, therefore, call upon the Government of the Maldives to restore all Articles of the Constitution, to allow the Supreme Court and other branches of the judiciary to operate in full independence, to promote and support the free and proper functioning of Parliament, to implement the Supreme Court’s Full Bench order of 1 February 2018 and to support a genuine political dialogue with all opposition parties.

In a late-night order, the five judges of the Maldives’ Supreme Court had issued a ruling that called for the release of political prisoners, ordered their re-trial and reinstated 12 disqualified parliamentarians.

It is interesting to note that India has specifically pointed out that the February 1 order was passed by a “full bench” of the Supreme Court.

After the arrest of Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and Judge Ali Hameed, the truncated Supreme Court had passed another order which had annulled the Feb 1 ruling. The Maldives government had since claimed that the arrested judges, along with other detainees including former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom were plotting a coup to bring down the administration.

India also, for the first time, specifically referred to the scheduled president elections this year and the need to restore credibility to the process before the dates are announced. “It is important for the government of the Maldives to ensure credible restoration of the political process, as well as the rule of law, before the elections are announced this year,” said the MEA press release.

Also referring to the polarised political situation in the Indian ocean island state, the MEA communique stated, “As a neighbour whose security is closely intertwined with that of the Maldives, India wishes to see a stable, peaceful and prosperous Maldives that meets the aspiration of its citizens”.

During the state of emergency, the majlis held a session, which was boycotted by the opposition, to give its stamp of approval to the state of emergency and passed a new anti-defection law.

Also, two days earlier, the prosecutor general charged the detained former chief justice, Supreme court judge, former president Gayoom and five others for orchestrating an act of terrorism. A criminal court also ordered that they will be remanded during their trial.

India has been unusually vocal about the current situation in Maldives, but has not taken direct interventionist steps like a military convoy or special envoy as requested by the Maldivian opposition.

The US ambassador to Maldives has also tweeted that the lifting of the emergency will not make much of a difference if “politically motivated prosecutions” continue.

The #Maldives #StateOfEmergency is over, but politically motivated prosecutions continue, and many citizens remain in jail for exercising their fundamental rights. For #Democracy to return, independent and impartial justice and a fully functioning #Majlis are essential. — Atul Keshap?? (@USAmbKeshap) March 22, 2018

The Maldivian opposition also stated that decision to lift the emergency will not make any practical difference in the ongoing crisis as the president no longer abides by laws or the constitution.

President Yameen lifts the SoE because he now has no need for it. He has overrun the judiciary and legislature, arrested hundreds unlawfully and introduced a “new normal” in the #Maldives – full dictatorship. We will not give up, we will fight and we will overcome. — Mohamed Nasheed (@MohamedNasheed) March 22, 2018

“The Joint Opposition continues to reiterate that the declaration of the state of emergency is unlawful and was used to further deepen Yameen’s grip on power and lifting of it does not change the worrying direction of travel in the Maldives. All opposition leaders are jailed, 31 out of 45 opposition MPs, including the opposition parliamentary group leader, are facing trial or charges. The regime continues to use the parliament to rubber stamp laws to legitimise the dictatorship and the entire judiciary has been brought under Yameen’s control,” said a press release issued by the Joint Opposition."
"India Conducts ASAT Test, Shoots Down Low Earth Orbit Satellite",https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/prime-minister-narendra-modi-speech-live,"Mar 27, 2019  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: In his live address to the nation on Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India had “shot down” a low orbit satellite in ‘Mission Shakti’. Saying that this was a “moment of pride” for all Indians, Modi said the country is now the fourth country to be a “space power” (after Russia, the US and China).

India has successfully targeted a live satellite on a low Earth orbit, the prime minister said. He called this a “big milestone”, and said that India is proud of its scientists.

According to him, Mission Shakti took three minutes to complete.

“Our aim is to maintain peace over war mongering. The space programme’s aim is peace, India’s economic and technological progress,” he said.

An FAQ released by the Ministry of External Affairs attested to this: “The test was done to verify that India has the capability to safeguard our space assets.” However, the page was taken down shortly after sans any explanation.

Modi also used his televised speech to project himself as India’s leader. “My aim is to make every Indian feel secured. I have great belief in the countrymen’s capabilities, commitment, dedication and ability to craft unitedly a nation which is strong, prosperous and secure. I envision such a Bharat where people can imagine such futuristic projects and garner the courage to go forward.”

Back in 2012, the DRDO chief had said in an interview with the Indian Express that the agency was willing show its anti-satellite capabilities if the government gave its nod. Given that was seven years, people may question the Modi government’s timing – just weeks before elections begin.

As The Wire has reported, the Indian anti-satellite (ASAT) test is believed to have destroyed either the Microsat-R or the Microsat-TD satellite, likelier the former according to some sources. They were both built by the DRDO. ISRO launched the Microsat-R on January 24 this year and the Microsat-TD a year before that.

After Modi’s address, several BJP leaders and ministers congratulated the government and scientists for the achievement.

Modi earlier in the morning said on Twitter that he had an “important message” for the nation, which he would deliver at 11:45 am-12 pm. However, he started speaking at 12:25 pm, leading to intense speculation.

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, आज सवेरे लगभग 11.45 – 12.00 बजे मैं एक महत्वपूर्ण संदेश लेकर आप के बीच आऊँगा। I would be addressing the nation at around 11:45 AM – 12.00 noon with an important message.

The Cabinet Committee of Security had met at the prime minister’s residence on Wednesday morning, followed by a meeting of all ministers.

Modi’s announcement raised many eyebrows, as the model code of conduct is in place ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The last time Modi addressed the nation was in November 2016, when he announced the demonetisation of high-value currency notes. Previously, in May 1999, then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced the Pokhran II nuclear tests in an address to the nation."
Why It's a Challenge To Make Quick Sense of India's Health Data,https://m.thewire.in/article/health/imr-mmr-data-nss-srs,"Jan 11, 2017  |  Oommen C. Kurian","Even when several government departments and ministries collect data across institutions and other stakeholders, these are not in line with standard definitions.

Data released by the Registrar General of India in December 2016 showed that India’s infant mortality rate (IMR) had come down to 37 in 2015 – with 41 in rural areas and 25 in urban areas. While this is better than what was previously predicted by the Ministry of Statistics, India is still way off the mark. In fact, we have now officially failed in achieving the Millennium Development Goal target of 27. And interestingly, a Sample Registration Survey bulletin only provided gender-disaggregated rural and urban IMR data for 21 ‘bigger states’. It stated: “Due to inadequate sample size, the infant mortality rate by sex, separately for rural and urban areas (for smaller states and Union Territories) is not given”.

Most national media platforms have yet to start reporting on the latest IMR numbers. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his post-demonetisation address to the nation on New Year’s eve, a key initiative on maternity benefits, part of the National Food Security Act’s as-yet unimplemented provisions – got dubbed by prominent sections of the English media merely as poll-time sops.

A part of the reason behind such insensitivity is a lack of understanding of the intensity of maternal and infant mortality issues, and the positive impact that maternity benefits can have on maternal and infant health. Another part is a general lack of is lack of regular, reliable and disaggregated data.

In May 2016, health secretaries of the states and union territories gathered in the national capital and issued the Delhi Commitment on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for health. Among other things, the document acknowledged the need to invest in health-data collection, analysis and research so that they could properly inform government policies and strategies necessary to address the various challenges facing India’s healthcare. Such commitment is imperative, given that the success of global SDGs over the next fifteen years will largely depend on India’s performance. Measuring progress closely to ensure mid-course corrections when needed should be key to the country’s health strategy.

In this context, the Observer Research Foundation recently came out with a set of four broad recommendations in a report, titled ‘Overcoming data challenges in tracking India’s health and nutrition targets’, on how national SDG implementation can be used as an opportunity to streamline and build on the existing national health statistical infrastructure to facilitate a health-data revolution.

Although India depends on sample surveys for tracking health parameters, there is a need to improve civil registration and vital statistics systems. The reliance on sample surveys is a result of the inadequate coverage of its civil registration system. But over time, the ‘interim’ measures acquired primary focus. With most states showing very good progress – barring perhaps Bihar and Uttar Pradesh – towards ensuring universal registration of births and deaths by the year 2020, promised in the ‘Vision 2020’ plan announced in 2014, we stand poised to be effectively able to improve the quality and reach of our basic demographic data many times over. And with focussed initiatives, we can ensure we don’t get derailed on this front.

Next, the existing sample surveys that collect data at the national level should be assessed for their comprehensiveness in a way that will improve disaggregated tracking of national goals. Unit-level data from sample surveys remains an under-utilised resource but numbers from databases like the National Sample Survey’s (NSS) ‘state samples’, whose collection uses up vast amounts of tax money, are often not used at all. The pooling of central and state samples and the ability to calculate district-level estimates across socio-economic categories will enhance the policy relevance of NSS data.

Given India’s twin burdens of communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as under-nutrition and over-nutrition, a comprehensive assessment of existing national surveys should be conducted with the aim of streamlining and strengthening them, as well as to arrive at a set of health and nutrition indicators that reflect India’s epidemiological realities.

Third, the national Health Management Information System, which currently covers only the public system and serves as the backbone for monitoring results of the National Health Mission comprising of the urban and rural sub-missions, needs extensive reform to accommodate the private healthcare delivery system. With most patients approaching the private sector for their healthcare needs, a lack of data on the private sector is unjustifiable. In this context, the unique health identification number (UHID) initiative at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and the suggestion to integrate UHID and Aadhaar – perhaps as part of the broader Integrated Health Information Platform, offers a very promising, if somewhat controversial, approach given the debates around Aadhaar in the country.

Finally, setting up a national forum on health and nutrition statistics in line with the federal inter-agency forum on child and family statistics of the US may help facilitate efficient coordination between the numerous agencies and government arms who collect, analyse and disseminate data. If India is aiming to improve the quality, availability and timeliness of data necessary to track national health goals, it has to address the core issue of the fragmentation of efforts. Routine monitoring systems installed to help flagship schemes may not be attuned to provide reliable data by themselves, after all.

Although several government departments and ministries collect data across institutions and other stakeholders, these are not in line with standard definitions. This calls for systematic efforts at the central level, taking state governments and departments on board, in the form of a national forum.

Such a national forum can standardise definitions, streamline the collection of data, triangulate existing data and avoid duplication in order to bring out a comprehensive set of indicators every year that will track health and nutrition progress at the sub-district level. Policy lessons can be derived from what the India HIV/AIDS Resource Centre has undertaken in terms of data from behavioural and epidemiological studies to arrive at a district situational analysis. The forum can also take up initiatives such as pooling of NSS central and state samples so that currently under-utilised NSS datasets can be of use to policymakers, academics, researchers and frontline workers.

These initiatives will help improve India’s ability to track progress in the health and nutrition domains, at least on an annual basis. They will also improve our ability to take mid-term corrections and ensure India succeeds with its globally relevant health and nutrition strategies.

They weren’t demanding India change its laws but when 27 foreign missions in Delhi issue a statement reaffirming their countries’ “commitment to equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex citizens”, the message is clear.

New Delhi: How do diplomats advocate equal rights for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and/or Intersex (LGBTI) community in a country where homosexuality is a criminal act? Rather delicately.

On Friday evening, senior diplomats from eight countries sat down for a rather unusual ‘chat’ at the American Library in Delhi. It was not a tête-à-tête but a public event with a large audience sitting on every available chair placed along the length of the hall.

June is marked as ‘Gay and Lesbian pride month’ by the United States government to commemorate the Stonewall riots – with US embassies around the world organising special events on LGBTI equality. The US embassy in Delhi has been similarly busy, but this year the intensity has been notched up a bit with the other diplomatic missions joining in for the first time.

In tandem with US embassy, 27 other foreign missions in Delhi – all Western or Latin American with Japan the only Asian nation among them – also issued a joint statement on Friday to “reaffirm our countries’ commitment to equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) citizens”, with an ‘annexe’ of important milestones in legal rights for the community in various countries.

The statement, just like most of the two-hour discussion on Friday, did not directly mention India’s controversial Section 377 which criminalises homosexual love – but the context is clear. Both the written statement and the conversation made it a point to acknowledge that India has been more progressive on the rights of the transgender community.

The killing of 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando also hung heavily on everybody’s mind at the discussion, which which was attended by senior diplomats from the embassies concerned.

The US embassy’s deputy chief of mission, Michael Pelletier, said that preparations for the ‘chat with diplomats’ on LGBTI rights had been in the planning for weeks, but the tragedy in Orlando starkly brought to the fore the need for such an event.

“As Canadians, we were outraged. It was an attack on all of us,” said Canada’s deputy high commissioner, Jess Dutton. He commended the US embassy for its “leadership in the last month” in organising LGBTI events, which he stressed was “very, very important in a country like India”.

LGBTI rights “are human rights”, said Norway’s political counsellor, Baard Hjelde, explaining why its activism is an important part of his country’s foreign policy. “This guides our policy at national level. It is an important part of my mandate as a Norwegian diplomat”.

Thibault Devanlay, the EU delegation’s political counsellor, used his personal example of having received institutional backing for harassment by a superior over his orientation as how the “practice” of equal laws can play out.

When asked if foreign governments had a regular dialogue with New Delhi on LGBT rights, Devanlay admitted candidly that it wasn’t easy. “I won’t hide the fact that this is difficult with the Indian government,” he said.

The EU has a human rights dialogue with India, but this is not the top-most item on the agenda. “I would not say that LGBT (issues) are prominent in the dialogue, but it is increasing,” he said.

Of course, he added, New Delhi also ensures that the dialogue is ‘balanced’. “It is not just us finger-pointing. The finger points to us easily too. There are valid questions that India raises with us also”. Devanlay didn’t mention India’s complaint to EU during the public event – but it is public knowledge that New Delhi has not been happy with European immigration policies.

An interlocutor at the annual India-EU human rights dialogue had described it as “to tell India that we know and for the Indians to signal that they know, we know”. Incidentally, India only has a separate bilateral channel on human rights with EU.

Just like Norway, the EU diplomat said that he had “instructions” to hold events on May 17, the International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia. “We also have instructions wherever possible to raise the rainbow flag,” he added. But, this last one has not happened yet in Delhi. The roadblock, though in a typical EU way, is due to certain technical guidelines which require taking into account how many other member states are also waving the flag.

He noted that earlier diplomatic events relating to gay rights used to take place “in a small room in the embassy”, but now it is “more and more public”.

He also added that there should not be undue expectations from foreign capitals to fuel the change, as the heavy lifting will have to be done by Indian civil society.

“We need to have pressure from Indian society… From inside… From elected officials,” said Devalany. Foreign diplomats do have contacts with civil society and Indian MPs, but it is mainly to understand the situation, he noted.

Pelletier was similarly careful about choosing his words, when a question was asked by an audience member on whether there was “any ray of hope” for the Indian LGBTI community.

“The many examples have shown us that every country advances at its own pace and own time. For change to be long-lasting, resilient, it has to come from within society. One of your huge strengths is free speech, civil society. I am sure that there will be enough debate about this,” said the US diplomat.

Citing the example of the UK foreign service, British deputy high commissioner Alexander Evans noted that “significant legal and cultural change can happen in a lifetime”.

He pointed out that the guidance for LGBT diplomats was only changed fully just 12 years ago. “Now there are many openly gay UK ambassadors. Even in the case of a small country, we had a fully gay mission. It was not due to social engineering or the UK trying to make a point. But that they were the right persons for the job. They were appointed sequentially and then it turned out to be a fully gay mission,” said Evans.

Indian rules as obstacle for gay diplomats

In India, postings for foreign diplomatic same-sex couples poses complexities at the time of visa application. “There are no rules, so it is very ad-hoc. The only thing that we have seen is that it depends on the state of bilateral relations,” a diplomat from a western country told The Wire. So, in the case of Italy and Denmark in Europe, with whom there have been tensions in the past, denying visas for diplomatic same-sex spouses was another way to express India’s unhappiness, he noted.

During the 2013 Devyani Khobragade controversy, in which the US arrested and strip-searched an Indian diplomat, senior BJP leader and former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha had demanded that the government arrest same-sex companions of US diplomats in India for violating Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code.

There are several same-sex diplomatic couples posted in Delhi. “I have not heard that they have faced many problems working here. But, then we in the diplomatic community live in our own bubble,” said another European diplomat.

If the diplomat’s partner is given a spouse visa, it eases living in India. “When they go to the bank, they hardly can make out if the other spouse is male or female. That is not a problem. The issue becomes a bit of a problem if the partner is given a ‘dependent’ visa, which is a different category with different privileges,” he said.

Different routes to equality

At Friday’s event, several diplomats provided accounts of how homosexuality was decriminalised in their own country to an attentive audience – but kept firmly away from commenting directly on the Indian situation.

Swedish deputy envoy Daniel Wolvén mentioned that the church had a leading role in improving the rights for gays by approving matrimony.

German embassy’s Björn Grözinger said that he was wearing two hats – one as a German diplomat, another as a representative of the LGBT community.

Noting that the German criminal code listed homosexual acts as a crime till 1994, Grözinger pointed out that there had been a strong public debate over gay rights since the 1970s. “1986 was another milestone, when the first gay kiss was broadcast in a German soap opera. Maybe in the discussion later on, we can talk of when the first gay kiss in Bollywood will happen,” he said.

Spain under the long Franco dictatorship had also criminalised homosexuality (though homosexulaity was decriminalised in the 19th century) with the law changing finally in 1979. While the legal situation had vastly improved, there are still lingering issues. The Spanish embassy’s political counsellor, Beatriz Lorenzo noted that bullying in schools was a serious concern.

Dutton noted that it was the current Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau’s father, Pierre Trudeau who had decriminalised same-sex sexual acts in 1969 as justice minister.

But since the discussion was being held in India, the legal reality of the country was the elephant in the room. Summing up the discussion, Pelletier noted that this was “perhaps the best way” to hold such events related to LGBTI rights. “Instead of hectoring… we are only sharing the progress made in our own countries”."
New FDI Norms in Time of COVID – Geopolitics or for the Real Economy?,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/new-fdi-norms-in-time-of-covid-geopolitics-or-for-the-real-economy,"May 02, 2020  |  Sunanda Sen","The move for capital account liberalisation, which took off in India within a few years of 1991 economic reforms, was followed by large inflows of non-debt creating foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio investment.

The steady opening up was responsible for a climate of uncertainty in the financial market with related surges in short-term portfolio investments by foreign institutional investors .

Despite the moderate-to-high growth rates in the domestic economy during the post global crisis years and till 2018, flows of FDI did not pick up as much as did portfolio investments.

As per RBI sources, there were disproportionate flows of portfolio investments, at $244.7 bn on average over the six years ending 2018-19. This contrasts to the much smaller average of $53.3 bn for FDI flows over the same period. Comparing the flows for a single year 2018-19, portfolio inflows at $256.9 bn was nearly four times of FDI flows at $64.8 bn.

The rising inflows as well as the changing composition of capital with financial liberalisation have impacted the Indian economy along predictable lines. Portfolio capital, as expected, initiated volatility in stock markets as well as in markets for real estates, commodity futures and foreign currency. One can observe the synchronized pattern between the rupee rate to US Dollar and the net flows of short term portfolio capital, especially since the short term capital inflows had easier access to the economy.

As for the impact of short term capital inflows on the domestic economy, the related gains/losses for the active agents in markets qualify as capital gains or losses which imparts no immediate change on real activities and output. As for example, we consider a capital gain or loss realised by an agent in the secondary market of stocks and selling a share which was bought in the primary market of Initial Primary Offers (IPOs). The share , was earlier sold by an agent to help real expansion (like a plant in a factory). But the capital gain/loss of the first agent, often based on speculation, is purely financial and distant from the sphere of real activities.A pattern as above reflects the major impact of overseas capital flows currently reaching India, consisting of portfolio capital.

The pattern of deployment, however, remains very different with FDI capital, whether those are for merger and acquisitions or greenfield ventures, since in either form, money invested is necessarily deployed for material activities.

Looking at the non-debt creating capital inflows which currently reach India, one can thus argue that the share directed to productive ventures is miserably small — standing at around one-fifth on average — of the vast sums hitting the non-productive arena of financial speculation.

Concerns like the ones above bring us to the recent changes in India’s FDI policy which went through a major review on April 17.

The government reviewed its FDI policy for “curbing opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies due to the current COVID-19 pandemic”. In terms of the amended FDI rule, “An entity of a country, which shares a land border with India or where the beneficial owner of investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route.”

Moreover, for existing or future FDIs any transfer of ‘beneficial ownership’ as above, involving a resident of a neighbouring country, the procedure of sanction has to go through the government approval route.

The change is a big departure from the earlier norm of a blanket approval of all FDI except in the prohibited strategic sectors /activities.

By redirecting all investments (existing and new ones) from neighbouring countries sharing land borders to government channels – the final approval may be delayed or not even granted. The change has led China to sharply react by branding the change as a ‘discriminatory’ act which is opposed to WTO principles.

While rest of the similarly situated countries in South Asia (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan) and SE Asia (Mynamar) don’t really contribute much in the way of providing direct investment flows to India, China of late has provided more than $10 bn between January to September 2019, as indicated by the commerce ministry. While the sum remains at not too large a proportion of aggregate FDI inflows to India, one can highlight related aspects which include first, the noticeable jump in China’s FDI contribution to India from a mere sum of $371.0 mn on average between 2014 and 2018 to $10.0 bn as mentioned above.

Secondly, the large sums entering as FDI to India from offshore financial hubs like the Cayman Islands at $119 bn and from Mauritius at $588 bn during Jan-September 2019 are, in all probability, not genuine FDI flows to India. Share of the contribution by China would be higher if such figures are taken care of. Third, since the new rules would relate to agencies even from countries having indirect links to the Chinese as investors, the step makes Hong Kong (at $30.7 bn) and even Singapore (if not formally) subject to the new rule .

It is a fact that with the current recession in the global economy, especially under the COVID, direct investment flows will not be abundantly available from many sources. This remains as a hard truth when interest in the real economy remains miniscule compared to speculation led flows of portfolio capital. As for the current stock of Chinese nvestments in India, one observes the contribution f tech giants such as Alibaba, Tiktok, Oppo, Xiaomi and Tencent to Paytm, BigBaske , Ola and many more in India.

Contributions as above have been responsible for jobs in those labour-intensive areas of operation as also with the Chinese car manufacturers like Great Wall and MG Motor.

Indications are thus ample to suggest that so far Chinese investments in India have been a help to employment rather than to casino finance of portfolio investments. The recent move by the People’s Bank of China to enhance its passive shareholder stake in HDFC by 0.3% which makes it 1.1% may have led the India government react with the amendments to FDI norms.

But , as pointed out by the CEO of the HDFC bank, Keki Mistry, the rise in share does not qualify for a takeover of the company or its management, and that PBoC is just one of the existing 2000 FIIs having accounts with the bank.

India’s move to amend the FDI policy which corners China in the Indian market for FDI can be viewed, in its face, as a step in geo-politics of keeping pace with US in particular, rather than in good economic strategy which helps the real economy and jobs."
The Indian Armed Forces and Petals: Yet Another Entertainer for the Indian Public?,https://m.thewire.in/article/government/indian-armed-forces-flower-petals,"May 02, 2020  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: The Narendra Modi government has once again announced a drill that has already been executed in the West. On Friday, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, along with the three service chiefs, declared that the Indian Air Force would conduct fly-pasts across the country on May 3, showering flower petals on medical facilities treating COVID-19 patients as a tribute to all “corona warriors”. The Navy would also illuminate its vessels on the same day, he added.

The exercise is likely to be yet another entertainer for the Indian public. However, the grandiose exercise may lose its novelty – the US Navy’s Blue Angels and the US Air Force’s Thunderbirds conducted a similar drill in several American cities on April 28.

A week ago, the Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense, had announced that the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds would conduct air salutes to express its gratitude to all those who are at the frontlines of the fight against the coronavirus. It dubbed the initiative as “Operation America Strong” to champion national unity.

The Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels are demonstration squadrons which were founded in the decade after World War II. The Pentagon said that they would fly together over York, Washington, Baltimore, Newark, Trenton, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Austin.

While the Indian armed forces do not have such dedicated squadrons, it is hard to miss the obvious similarities between the two planned stunts. General Rawat said that the Air Force would fly both its fighter and transport jets from Srinagar to Trivandrum, and from Dibrugarh in Assam to Kutch in Gujarat.

One could say that the idea of showering petals is different, but petals made an appearance during Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath’s Kanwar Yatra in 2018.

Inspiration or imitation?

In March, we also saw the prime minister ask people to come out on their balconies and bang thalis in appreciation of essential workers. Later, he asked the Indian public to step out for nine minutes and light lamps. Both these calls bore resemblances to events in Italy where people came out onto their balconies to sing, play music, and dance in support of healthcare workers. Days ahead of Modi’s announcement, videos of such European events had gone viral on social media.

Now, the Indian government has instructed its armed forces to take a leaf out of an American initiative even though the air tribute led to many Americans flouting physical distancing norms. Hundreds packed the streets and parks of New York, walked shoulder to shoulder, to catch a glimpse of the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds performing.

The Indian enterprise will most likely go the same way too, and may cause greater havoc than the US. To start with, hospitals will have the additional task of clearing their premises of flower petals once the tribute exercise is done and dusted.

﻿

Nonetheless, the armed forces are set to create a spectacle on May 3, and it will receive widespread applause. The next time the Modi government plans an exercise like this, a little originality would be appreciated."
India and Russia Must Work Out Their Differences in the South Asia Region,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-russia-south-asis,"Jun 01, 2017  |  Sharanya Rajiv","Given the breadth and depth of the Indo-Russian relationship, the divergence in their strategy for the South Asia region is worrying.

On the sidelines of the recently-held Belt and Road Forum, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Reports indicate that the Russian and Chinese leadership have offered to help mediate tensions between Pakistan and India. This news is emblematic of the divergence between Indian and Russian approaches to their neighbourhood in recent times. The Russian approach identifies ISIS in the Khorasan Province (ISKP), not the Taliban, as the most immediate threat and considers Pakistan a partner for security in the region, along with coordinating its actions in the region with Pakistan and China. This worries India, who maintains that there can be no choice between the ISKP and Taliban, and views Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism. Given the breadth and depth of the Indo-Russian relationship, this divergence in their strategy for the region is a worrying trend and one that demands closer attention by policymakers in both Delhi and Moscow.

Moscow’s resurgent role in the Afghan theatre can be traced back to the withdrawal of NATO and US troops, in light of which the first of three Russia-China-Pakistan trilateral consultations on the situation in Afghanistan was held in Beijing on April 2013, with the second and third rounds taking place in November 2013 and December 2016. In the most recent trilateral consultation, the three countries controversially agreed on “flexible approaches to the prospect of excluding certain individuals from the list of sanctioned persons” and took note of the rising activity of the ISKP. Russia’s policy towards Afghanistan, as laid out by Zamir Kabulov, Russia’s presidential envoy to Afghanistan, has evolved into one that identifies the Taliban as a predominantly local force and recognises the coincidence of Russian and Taliban interests against the ISKP. It recognises the latter as a global jihadist force, one that poses the greatest threat to the region. On the other hand, India believes that assessments implying there is a choice between terrorist forces in Afghanistan endanger the gains made in the country and that “a policy of zero tolerance towards violence and terrorism” is essential.

Russia has simultaneously increased its security cooperation with Pakistan. Both nations signed a military cooperation agreement in November 2014, during the first visit of a Russian defence minister to Pakistan. This was followed by a deal for the sale of four Mi-35M helicopters by Russia to Pakistan, to be delivered this year. The first Russia-Pakistan counter-narcotics exercise that included naval participation was held in October 2014 followed by a second exercise in December 2015. The following year, the first joint military exercise, Druzhba 2016, was held in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan, on the heels of the Uri terror attack in India. The resulting strain on the India-Russia relationship was even more pronounced because the initial statement mentioned Rattu in the disputed territory of Gilgit-Baltistan as one of the exercise locations, though a clarification was later issued. This was followed by the first ever Pakistan-Russia foreign office consultations on regional issues in Islamabad in December 2016. India is concerned that Russo-Pakistan cooperation may engender instability in the region and has conveyed “to the Russian side that military cooperation with Pakistan, which is a state that sponsors and practices terrorism as a matter of state policy, is a wrong approach.” Russia’s silence on terrorism and on India’s demand that two Pakistan-based terror groups be named in the Goa Declaration of the 2016 BRICS Summit, along with its declaration of support for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), has caused considerable disquietude in New Delhi, given India’s position on terrorism emanating from Pakistan and its objection to CPEC on grounds of sovereignty.

In the meanwhile, Russia’s sectoral cooperation with India has continued, with a spate of agreements having been signed in recent years. India and Russia’s cooperation in military technology and nuclear sectors is likely to stay in place for the foreseeable future despite Indian attempts to diversify its dependence on Russia, and further develop indigenous capacity. The eighth India-Russia joint military exercise, Indra-2016, coincided with Russia’s exercise with Pakistan, which was followed by the ninth India-Russia naval exercise, Indra Navy-2016, in December, 2016. Indian defence minister Arun Jaitley has announced the upgradation of this year’s exercise to the tri-service format, a first for both sides. Russia was also one of the few countries to name Pakistan in its statement condemning the Uri attack, expressing concern over India’s statement that the attack originated from Pakistani territory. In light of its recent bonhomie with Pakistan and softer approach towards the Taliban, however, this indicates that while the relationship is no longer driven by a shared approach towards the region, the momentum generated by the earlier existence of such an approach has not yet been lost.

Russia’s efforts to separate its engagements with Pakistan and India are driven by its belief that Pakistan is an influential regional actor and cooperating with it will help eliminate the threat of terrorism, especially the ISKP, in the region. It is also a possible reaction to India’s growing ties with the US and others, along with efforts to reduce its dependence on Russia for military technology. This is not the first time that India has been faced with a Russia-Pakistan conundrum. While the USSR’s overtures to Pakistan in the 1960s gave rise to similar concerns in India, the bilateral relationship could draw on Cold War geopolitical alignments for sustenance. This convergence of Indian and Russian interests in the region is missing today. While joint statements by India and Russia in recent years continue to note the importance of combating terrorism, and of close consultation and cooperation on Afghanistan, both sides have been drifting apart when it comes to action and envision the region differently.

There are limits to how far a relationship can survive based purely on past achievements and sectoral cooperation. While India and Russia will continue to be important partners in the defence and nuclear sectors in the foreseeable future, if their strategic partnership in South Asia is to remain relevant, both sides must go back to the drawing board and recalibrate their divergent approaches to their common neighbourhood.

New Delhi: With celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, which sent man to the Moon for the first time, underway, the Press Information Bureau of India has shared a series of press releases that show how India commemorated the achievement. The Apollo 11 mission, with its crew of Neil Armstrong, Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin and Michael Collins, was launched on July 16, 1969 and ended eight days later, on July 24. The Moon-landing itself happened on July 20.

#FromPIBArchives : #MoonLanding50

: The historic landing of #Apollo11 on the #moon on July 20, fifty years ago, left footprints on our press releases from that period as well.They ranged from announcement of a commemorative stamp, special programmes, to an official statement pic.twitter.com/Iko8twhSwF — PIB India (@PIB_India) July 19, 2019

The first press release, issued on July 21, 1969 – a day after Armstrong and Aldrin set foot on the natural satellite – Prime Minister Indira Gandhi hailed the mission as “one of the most exciting and significant moments in the history of man”. (Interestingly, the press releases contain Indian calendar dates, too: July 21, 1969 is also recorded as Asadha 30, 1891.)

Gandhi’s message celebrates the “irrepressible spirit of man”, which she says “leaps from one celestial body to another in a small vehicle of its own making”. She also says the moment calls for some humility and self-search. “Has man who seeks heavenly suburbs, made his own Earth more habitable, friendly and beautiful? Let us direct this power of man which soars starwards into strengthening the bonds of peace and brotherhood on Earth.”

On the next day, July 22, 1969 (Asadha 31, 1891), another press release announces that the All India Radio will broadcast a discussion on the Moon landing. The discussion, in English, was titled ‘Flight To Moon’ and was broadcast on July 23 at 9:45 pm. Participants in the discussion included planning commission member B.D. Nag Chaudhury, Solid-State Physics Laboratory director S.C. Jain, National Physical Laboratory scientist V.G. Bhide and Delhi University professor F.C. Auluck.

A fortnight later, on August 7, 1969 (Sravana 16, 1891), the PIB says the films division newsreel will present the “significance of man’s footsteps on the Moon” in a “vivid manner”. The newsreel, titled ‘Footprints on the Moon’ was released on August 8, and also covered the visit of US President Richard Nixon and his wife Pat Ryan to India.

In the last of the press releases shared by the bureau, the posts and telegraph department announced on November 2, 1969 (Kartika 11, 1891) that, to commemorate the “epoch making achievement of moon landing”, it would release a special stamp on November 19.

The 20-paise stamp was to be printed in raw sienna colour, with a vertical design, according to the department. “It will depict a man on the moon’s surface. A part of space and the earth will be shown in the background.”

The stamp’s release date (November 19, 1969) was planned to coincide with the Apollo 12 mission’s scheduled landing on the Moon. This mission – carrying astronauts Charles Conrad Jr, Richard F. Gordon Jr and Alan L. Bean – was launched on November 14 and also completed its mission successfully.

In the background information provided by the press release, it remarks that 15 years before the landing happened, “talk of sending man to the moon would have been dismissed as ‘moon-shine'”."
How Should India’s New Social Stock Exchange be Regulated? ,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/how-should-indias-new-social-stock-exchange-be-regulated,"Jul 28, 2019  |  Neeti Bhatt","One of the more interesting measures in this year’s Union budget was a proposal aimed at streamlining the development and social impact sector.

The proposed introduction of a ‘social stock exchange’ (SSE) anticipates increasing public participation in the sector, expanding investment and organised tracking of the benefits.

While details still need to be worked out, the vision of an SSE may addresses some serious transparency and accountability issues that are creeping into the development sector, while increasing investor participation.

There is no history of such a platform in India and most countries that have set one up have taken varied approaches. These range from the exchange functioning as a knowledge bank for impact investors and voluntary organisations, to the exchange acting as a platform where instruments such as shares issued by voluntary organisations are traded.

In her budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman described the new exchange as such:

“It is time to take our capital markets closer to the masses and meet various social welfare objectives related to inclusive growth and financial inclusion. I propose to initiate steps towards creating an electronic fund raising platform – a social stock exchange – under the regulatory ambit of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for listing social enterprises and voluntary organisations working for the realisation of a social welfare objective so that they can raise capital as equity, debt or as units like a mutual fund.”

If this is any indication, then the proposed SSE will be designed as new fundraising medium that will allow listing of ‘social enterprises’ and/ or ‘voluntary organisations’ so that they can raise money through equity or debt, or a combination of both by way of units of funds.

Many in the market are currently speculating that the use of the word ‘exchange’ essentially means that such instruments or units shall be tradeable. It is also fairly clear that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is the government’s choice for regulating the activities proposed to be conducted on the SSE.

Also read: Budget 2019 Reeks of a Lack of Real Ambition

In order to analyse this choice, it is necessary to delve into how the SSE is likely to function, the nature of entities it wishes to govern and most importantly whether this kind of governance falls within the existing SEBI machinery.

For example, in case the SSE is merely a directory aimed at connecting potential investors with relevant social organisations, it may be better to establish an independent body akin to the Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest (CERSAI) set up primarily to act as a database of existing credit arrangements between lenders and companies in India and serves as a ready reference for lenders to diligence potential borrowing entities.

The formulation of the SSE proposed so far, involves listing of organisations and also creation of an e-fundraising platform both of which may hugely benefit from the reliability of the SEBI mechanism and the reputation it enjoys with investors both in India and internationally.

SEBI also has a deeply organised and well-oiled grievance redressal and dispute resolution system that may be used even for the SSE without much modification. Furthermore, the capital markets regulatorI has a decent track record of updating its regulatory arsenal to ensure that the laws do not fall behind market conditions, this adaptability may be its strongest suit while stepping into a sector where malfeasance and lack of transparency are very commonplace.

However, before SEBI can assume control of the SSE structure, whenever it is finally decided, it needs to address some specific concerns relating to the strategic philanthropy sector.

First and foremost is the list of players in this market. The contours of a ‘social enterprise’ and a ‘voluntary organisation working for the realisation of a social welfare objective’ will have to be defined – because, the wider the scope of these terms, the more diverse will the regulatory framework need to be. Unlike any other sector, there is a wide spectrum of organisations that exist in this space, diverse not just in their corporate make-up but also in the work that they undertake and what level of participation they actually have with the said objective of social welfare.

Also read: India Inc Must End its ‘Bribe, Settle and Move-on Culture’

The next set of players are the potential investors. The treatment of investors will have to vary on the basis of who falls within its ambit. For instance, should only high net-worth individuals and companies that work in the impact investment sector be allowed to participate? Or should it be open to public participation? Both will require a different regulatory framework.

The level of disclosures to be made by the organisations raising funds will also vary on this basis. This will get further layered in case of foreign funding (even though, the government has been traditionally sceptical of foreign funding in this area). The foreign investment provisions in India fall within the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and may need to be modified to allow for this nature of funding activity.

The final set of players will be some new classes of intermediaries such as impact assessors, valuers, trustees, etc – the whole gamut of which can be identified only once the infrastructure is set up. SEBI will need to formulate regulations to govern their registration and scope of activity. Despite, the enormity of the task, it is not an altogether unchartered territory for SEBI.

Second, is the issue of return on investment (ROI). Most investments are run on a return of investment basis and the popularity of an investment is often wholly dependent on how high such ROI is. In case of impact investment, the ROI will most likely be the benefit to the social welfare objective the investor is contributing towards.

The calculation of such a return, for which no accepted criteria exists at the moment, gets even more complicated in cases where an investor invests in a portfolio of social welfare organisations, whose objectives could be vastly diverse – tracking of the actual benefit is therefore likely to require a whole new substructure along with the ability to quantify such benefit in a comparable manner.

If the corporate social responsibility (CSR) obligations of companies are also included in the mix, the returns may also be in the form of tax rebates, which are provided on a one-time basis annually against the annual CSR contributions of a company.

Finally, an important concern is that of tradeability. In due course, when government agencies are able to address the first two issues raised above, the issue of tradeability will still be one of the trickiest courses to navigate. In case an instrument issued on the SSE is to be traded, the primary question will be the value to be assigned to such instrument. An additional question will be regarding the transferability of the tax rebates that were discussed above.

Also read: Explaining the Rise in Revenue Deficit Between Modi Govt’s Interim and Full Budgets

It would seem that trading in instruments issued by social welfare organisations will require an additional mechanism that calculates the value of each such instrument on the basis of the ROI methodology that is devised. The kind of valuation that is assigned to such instruments, will also need to increase or decrease organically on the basis of a matrix which will also have to be designed.

Even with these issues in tow, the fact remains that the above functions are not dissimilar to the work that the SEBI already undertakes and accordingly, setting up an additional body to regulate and/ or govern the SSE will inevitably delay the launch of this platform, lead to a loss of opportunity to capitalise on the credibility that the SEBI already enjoys in the market and add a financial burden on an already struggling sector.

In conclusion therefore, based on the limited information that is available, the SEBI may be the body best suited to the role of regulator of the proposed SSE. Its extensive expertise notwithstanding, the extent of overhaul it will require over the existing infrastructure, the totality of the new laws, policies and formulations that need to be drafted and the time it will take to achieve and finally launch the SSE may be gauged only after the specifics have been brought forth.

Pakistan Formally Suspends Trade Ties With India,https://m.thewire.in/article/trade/pakistan-formally-suspends-trade-ties-with-india,"Aug 10, 2019  |  PTI","Islamabad: Pakistan has formally suspended its trade relations with India after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.

On Friday, the federal cabinet headed by Prime Minister Imran Khan endorsed the decisions taken by the National Security Committee and the joint session of parliament, which include suspension of trade ties with India, Dawn reported.

Trade relations between the two neighbours were already strained following the Pulwama terror attack as India imposed 200% customs duty on all goods imported from the neighbouring nation.

Imports from Pakistan declined by 92% to USD 2.84 million in March this year compared to USD 34.61 million in March 2018, according to the commerce ministry data. During the January-March period of 2018-19 fiscal, imports from Pakistan declined by 47% to USD 53.65 million.

Two notifications were issued soon after the cabinet meeting to implement the decision to suspend bilateral trade with India with immediate effect and until further orders, the report said.

One notification suspends all kind of exports to India, while the other banned import of goods of Indian origin or those imported from it. Earlier, this ban was only limited to imports from Israel with which Pakistan has no trade ties at all.

Pakistan’s imports have already entered negative growth with almost all countries, except India, as Islamabad mostly imports raw materials from India, the report said.

According to a data of Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), the total exports from India to Pakistan in the financial year 2018-2019 was around USD 2 billion. The major items exported by India include chemical products and textiles among others, and the imported items include mineral products and vegetable items.

On Monday, India revoked Article 370 to withdraw the special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the region into two union territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

In reaction to India’s move, Pakistan on Wednesday downgraded diplomatic ties with India by expelling Indian High Commissioner Ajay Bisaria and announced that it would also suspend trade relations with New Delhi.

India has said Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of India and the issue was strictly internal to the country.

Pakistan has also suspended the import of Indian goods under the Pak-Afghan transit treaty, Special assistant to the prime minister on information Firdous Ashiq Awan told a media briefing on Friday."
The NDA’s Ministry of Un-Skilling India,https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/the-ndas-ministry-of-un-skilling-india,"Jul 12, 2016  |  Pushparaj Deshpande","A year after Narendra Modi’s Skill India initiative was introduced, the country remains far from capitalising on its demographic dividend.

It is universally acknowledged that India has an enormous demographic dividend. By 2026, nearly 65% of our population will be between 15-64 years (with 35% being below 35). Given that, the country is poised to become the world’s single destination for skilled human resources. However, only 25% of India’s graduates, less than 10% of MBA graduates and 17% of engineers are employable (i.e., they have the necessary skill set to be employed by industries across sectors). Also, a vast majority of our population works in the informal sector, with little quantifiable skills. Consequently, our much hailed demographic dividend also happens to be a “demographic time bomb”. India needs to aggressively invest in providing skills to its youth to capitalise on this untapped potential.

The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), which was established to upgrade the UPA government’s skill development infrastructure, the National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) and the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), was a step in the right direction. This was especially so because despite their best intentions, the UPA governments had ended up reducing the grand aim of skill development to select training programs undertaken by various ministries and departments. Half-hearted attempts were made to streamline these programs, but there was no clear focus on skill development. The MSDE promised to bring cohesiveness and unity of purpose to skill development in India. However, apart from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s much publicised chest thumping on skill development, the NDA government has done nothing to expedite the process and has stumbled at many instances.

Given that it was to be a nodal point for the coordination of all skill efforts across India, much was expected of the MSDE’s “Common Norms” (subsequently amended in May 2016), which were to bring about uniformity and standardisation in the implementation of various skill development schemes by different central ministries and departments. However, what is extremely shocking is that the ministry’s own flagship program, the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) still does not adhere to the common norms. The PMKVY does not have standardised minimum hours, training cost norms, funding norms or input standard norms. This poses serious implications on the credibility of Modi’s Skill India initiative.

Furthermore, the two bodies responsible for certifying people, the National Council of Vocational Training and the Assessment Agencies empanelled by the Sector Skills Councils, work at odds with one other. They follow dichotomous norms, be it with regard to hours of training, competency standards, assessment norms or certification. This defeats the idea of a unified nationwide skill certification, without which employers won’t have a common metric of gauging the skill set of potential employees.

The NDA’s comedy of errors doesn’t stop there. The PMKVY was designed so that the government would fund agencies to train people (Rs 10,000 was given for each individual trained). However, the government has not set up any monitoring or evaluation mechanisms to gauge the efficacy or the quality of training, thus reducing the scheme to mere statistical jugglery. Consequently, a whooping Rs 1,500 crore was spent hastily and without clarity on outcomes.

Realising the enormity of the blunder (or was it a deliberate diversion to benefit nefarious interests?), the NDA switched to funding 600 Kaushal Kendras and guaranteed them steady business. Firstly, the NDA has made the eligibility criterion so rigid that only a few companies are qualified, which opens the door for corruption and an exclusivist ecosystem. Secondly, by taking upon itself the responsibility of providing students, the NDA has removed any incentive for these Kendras to be genuinely interested in being quality institutions of skill development, since they need not be competitive to be attractive options for students.

The vision of skilling India has been further stymied by the way the NDA is managing it. Originally, the NSDA was designed to be an independent regulatory authority for quality assurance of skill development. The NDA has relegated the NSDA under MSDE and instead of an independent director general at the NSDA, it is led by a joint secretary within the ministry (thereby eliminating any scope for an honest appraisal of skilling programmes). Furthermore, both the NSDA and the NSDC have the same chairperson, which is clearly a conflict of interest, for one body is meant to implement the schemes for skilling and the other to regulate them. Adding to this chaotic management structure, the PMKVY, which is also managed by the NSDC, is managed by another joint secretary.

Everyone in this swamp of institutions functions in independent silos, which has obviously resulted in severe conflicts of ideas and functions. How can we expect the MSDE to coordinate the skill agenda for the country when it cannot even coordinate or streamline itself?

It’s highly unlikely that India will capitalise on its demographic dividend if the current state of affairs continues. There are no innovative and radical strategies being deployed to skill India, nor is there any evidence of a framework to operationalise this. Plato once argued that empty vessels make the loudest noise. Both the prime minister and MSDE will therefore do well to remember that you are what you do, not what you say you will do.

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday released the All India Tiger Estimation Report 2018 and said the country has emerged as one of the biggest and safest habitats for tigers in the world.

The tiger population in the country has grown from 1,411 in 2006 to 2,967 in 2019, according to the report.

“With around 3,000 tigers, India has emerged as of one of the biggest and safest habitats for them in the world,” Modi said, as he lauded all the stakeholders involved in the country’s tiger conservation exercise.

“Nine long years ago, it was decided in St. Petersburg (Russia) that the target of doubling the tiger population would be 2022. We in India completed this target four years in advance. This is the finest example of ‘Sankalp Se siddhi’ (attainment through resolve),” he said.

He invoked two Bollywood movie titles to emphasise the need to expand and strengthen tiger conservation efforts.

“I just want to tell the people associated with this work that the story which started with Ek Tha Tiger and reached Tiger Zinda Hai should not stop there. This will not work. The work towards tiger conservation has to be expanded and sped up,” he said.

The PM said that the development versus environment conservation debate will continue with both sides suggesting as if these are mutually exclusive, but it was possible to strike a healthy balance between the two.

He said that while in the last five years, the focus was on to build next-generation infrastructure in the country, there has also been an increase in the forest cover and number of protected areas.

“In 2014, the number of protected areas was 692, the number rose to more than 860 in 2019. Similarly, the number of community reserves were 43 in 2014 and rose to more than 100 in 2019,” he said.

He said India will build more homes for its citizens and also create quality habitats for animals at the same time.

Note: An earlier version of the article stated that the tiger population in the country has doubled since 2014."

"Amid Falling Rupee, Trade War, Foreign Investors Pull out Rs 356 Bn From Indian Markets",https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/rupee-fpi-trade-india,"Oct 28, 2018  |  PTI","New Delhi: Foreign investors have pulled out a massive Rs 356 billion (about $5 billion) from the Indian capital markets this month on concerns over rupee depreciation, global trade war tiff and rising crude prices.

The latest outflow is higher than Rs 210 billion worth of net withdrawals seen in entire September. Prior to that, overseas investors had invested a net sum of Rs 74 billion in the capital markets (both equity and debt) in July-August.

According to the latest depository data, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold equities to the tune of Rs 241.86 billion during October 1-26 and bonds worth Rs 114.07 billion, taking the total to Rs 355.93 billion ($4.8 billion).

Also read: With Surging Oil and a Nervous Rupee, Is India’s Macro Magic Starting to Fade?

FPIs have been net sellers almost throughout this year barring a couple of months such as January, March, July and August. In these four months, overseas investors have put funds totalling over Rs 320 billion. However, experts believe withdrawal of funds in October has shaken the market.

So far this year, FPIs have pulled out a total of Rs 970 billion from the capital markets. This includes over Rs 370 billion from equities and close to Rs 600 billion from the debt markets.

According to Rahul Mishra, AVP (Derivatives), Emkay Global Financial Services, macro issues like liquidity crunch created post IL&FS default, Indian currency move and volatility in crude oil price have kept the investors at bay.

“The continued selling pressure from FPI is needed to be looked from the angle of what is happening globally. From the Indian context, the current issues faced by the NBFC (non-banking finance company) is not helping either,” said R. Sreesankar, co-head equities at Prabhudas Lilladher.

Going ahead, market experts said volatility is likely to continue for other reasons too such as US sanctions on Iran, which take effect next month, as Iran is a major source of crude oil for India. Besides, India has some key state elections coming up, which could provide cues to FPIs for next year’s central elections."
Sale of Liquor Could Dilute India’s Efforts to Contain Spread of Coronavirus,https://m.thewire.in/article/government/liquor-sale-alcohol-coronavirus,"May 01, 2020  |  Monika Arora and Kashish Aneja","The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC), the apex body of leading liquor firms recently wrote to the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Health as well as to various state governments to allow online sale of liquor while the lockdown continues.

While CIABC presents an economic and livelihood argument to support their demand, which might appear convincing to states considering depleting state exchequer, several public health concerns surrounding the online sale of alcoholic beverages require attention in the COVID-19 context.

Alcohol and health

According to WHO, alcohol consumption contributes to over 3 million deaths (5% of all deaths) each year globally.

As per the Global Burden of Diseases, there has been a constant rise in the number of deaths attributed to the use of alcohol over the last two decades with the total number of deaths increased (in absolute numbers) by more than 5% between 2010 and 2016 alone.

Alcohol has been linked with approximately 230 diseases, including 40 diseases that would not prevail without alcohol.

It has been attributed to deaths that have occurred due to infectious diseases, intentional and unintentional injuries, digestive diseases, Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), and suicides. In 2016, it was the seventh leading risk factor for both death and disability-adjusted life years.

WHO’s position is clear that any alcohol use is associated with some amount of risk, and from a public health perspective and at the population level there are no levels of consumption at which no risks are involved.

Also read: Virus Lockdown: Why it Makes Financial Sense for States to Start Selling Alcohol

In India, about 32% of adults are current alcohol consumers, more than half of whom are hazardous drinkers. This is concurrent with the finding that while drinkers constitute a minority, heavy alcohol use is the signature drinking pattern with a strong preference for high-strength beverages such as spirits.

A worldwide analysis of heavy episodic drinking among current drinkers (15+ years) places India in the 30-44.9% prevalence category.

Alcohol and COVID-19

In the current COVID-19 crisis, alcohol as an underlying risk factor, related to several NCDs demands attention. India is already witnessing the interaction of COVID-19 with NCDs including hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, kidney diseases and a variety of cancers.

NCDs predispose affected individuals to infections and increase the risk of severe illness and death among the infected. NCDs contribute to around 60% of all deaths in India. At a time when the country is preparing to boost its healthcare infrastructure to fight the unpredictable global pandemic, it is necessary to address the risk factors underlying NCDs and reduce the predictable burden on the healthcare infrastructure.

WHO has recommended a healthy lifestyle for better bodily functions, including boosting immunity, in the times of the COVID-19 crisis. The proposed healthy practices include among other behaviours, avoiding alcohol intake and quitting tobacco.

Permitting the online sale of liquor as proposed by CIABC will increase access to alcohol and augment heavy drinking by individuals, under lockdown due to lack of work, isolation, and stress induced from uncertainties surrounding the present global crisis.

Besides, alcohol attributable harms are often underestimated, especially for women and children. Alcohol contributes to domestic violence perpetrated against women and people under 15 years of age, who do not consume alcohol but who are at risk of injuries from violence caused by the alcohol user. The effect of the present lockdown in India and increasing risks of domestic violence is already surfacing in news reports.

Legal Obligations and Commitments

In February 2020, a unanimous decision was adopted at the WHO Executive Board (EB) meeting that identified the global alcohol burden as a “public health priority” and requested “accelerated action” on alcohol harm.

Also read: Amidst Lockdown, Chhattisgarh Becomes Second State to Reopen Alcohol Stores

The EB highlighted the overall burden of disease and injuries attributable to alcohol consumption that remained unacceptably high and emphasised on the sufficiency of evidence for the carcinogenicity of alcohol.

During this session, a bloc of countries led by Thailand won the approval to develop a new global action plan to reduce alcohol harm. India was among the 10 member States that proposed the draft decision, reflecting on the government’s commitment to promoting public health.

The Indian government is also bound by other national and international commitments that mandate the government to respect, protect, and fulfil the right to health of its citizens. Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and Article 3 of the International Health Regulations (IHR) are of relevance to global health and enunciates the definitive formulation of the right to health.

Alcohol also finds mention in the global agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as it is linked with poverty eradication, gender equality, and reducing violence against women.

The Indian government has also adopted a National Target of achieving 10% relative reduction in the prevalence of Alcohol use by 2025.

The national lockdown, which is aimed at controlling the spread of the coronavirus, provides an excellent opportunity to ramp up de-addiction services and assist people in quitting alcohol by reducing availability and access.

The Supreme Court has interpreted Article 21 of the Indian constitution to include the fundamental right to health and casts an obligation on the Government to preserve life and provide for adequate nutrition. By increasing access to alcohol during the present global and national health crises, the government may not only be in violation of Article 21 but may also be in conflict with Article 47, a Directive Principle that imposes on the State a primary duty to raise the level of nutrition, the standard of living and improve public health, and bring about prohibition of intoxicating drinks and drugs which are injurious to health.

Of the ten strategies recommended in the WHO’s Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol (2010), one of the core interventions is to enact and enforce restrictions on the physical availability of alcoholic beverages.

Considering the cost-effectiveness of this intervention, it also features as one of WHO’s best buys.

Increasing availability and improving access by permitting online sale and home delivery of alcoholic beverages (a non-essential commodity) will be counterproductive to the national efforts of the Government of India undertaken to curb the spread of the Corona virus and might render purposeless all the sacrifices made by the common man and the brunt borne by the national economy.

To avoid a domino effect of increasing burden on the healthcare infrastructure, every government decision must be made with a public health lens that addresses underlying risk factors of other communicable and non-communicable diseases.

India’s Digital Response to COVID-19 Risks Creating a Crisis of Trust,https://m.thewire.in/article/tech/covid-19-aarogya-setu-surveillance,"May 01, 2020  |  Divij Joshi","A smartphone app used by over 60 million people. Drones in the sky tracking people’s movement and checking their temperature. Facial recognition cameras reporting to the police on whether someone has broken quarantine.

These are some of the ways in which Central and state governments have put technology at the forefront of the efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic in India. It may appear intuitive and appealing, at this time of crisis, to turn to technologies like the internet and artificial intelligence, which have been widely adopted and seen such tremendous social and financial investment in recent years. However, in the haste to deploy these digital solutions, there has been little introspection on implementing the legal and technical frameworks which can ensure that these technologies help, rather than hinder, public health and social trust.

The manner in which the Aarogya Setu app is being deployed is symptomatic of this lack of introspection. Aarogya Setu was designed as a ‘digital contact tracing’ app which can inform users whether they are at risk of COVID-19 infection, to help people self-quarantine and allow them to approach public health authorities. However, reports are emerging on a daily basis of how this app, which was intended to be ‘consensual’ and voluntary, is now being mandated by the Central government, for everyone from government employees, to delivery workers and construction workers.

Reports have also emerged of the arbitrary arrest and quarantine of a woman in Mumbai, allegedly based on information gathered from Aarogya Setu. The Central government also has plans to use the application to determine people’s mobility, by issuing ‘e-passes’ on the app, and the CISF has suggested making the app mandatory for travelling in public transport like the Delhi Metro.

This use of digital technology is disproportionately affecting poor and marginalised communities. In a country where an estimated 65% of the population does not have internet access, let alone a smartphone and constant power supply, making a smartphone app as the focal point to determine people’s livelihoods will leave out the millions who cannot rely on Internet connectivity or power access. Moreover, ‘social distancing’ is an impossibility for the millions who are dependent on daily wages for their livelihoods, and enforcing the same through surveillance and punitive measures like enforced quarantine, will likely compound their difficulties.

Also read: Will Bluetooth and Aarogya Setu Allow Us to Safely Exit the COVID-19 Lockdown?

In the absence of safeguards, these technologies often make decisions which are both incorrect, and difficult to challenge or override. For example, if a person’s ‘health status’ is determined by Aarogya Setu instead of by clinical testing, a negative result can mistakenly subject people to limitations on their movement, possibly depriving them of daily wages, while leaving them with little prospects of understanding or overriding such a decision. This is apart from the fact that the technological claims of ‘digital contact tracing’ have been widely disputed the world over – countries with widespread smartphone adoption like Singapore and Taiwan have cautioned against relying heavily on digital contact tracing without backing it up by widespread testing and human contact tracing.

The same technologies being encouraged to aid in humanitarian efforts have historically been used by governments and corporations alike to aid undemocratic surveillance and control, in a manner which have left people with little control over their data and their lives in an increasingly ‘digital’ world. Incidents like the misuse of Aadhaar data by governments, or the misuse of Facebook data to influence voters have created a serious crisis of trust in digital technologies.

This crisis of trust pervades and hampers our current ‘technology-first’ efforts to mitigate the pandemic. Reopening a nationwide lockdown and resuming a semblance of social life requires widespread trust and cooperation between and among individuals, communities and the government, particularly the public health system. If, instead, technologies are used to punish and stigmatise individuals, there can be no expectation of such cooperation.

Building and deploying technologies without transparency, or without involving communities in understanding its functioning and its limitations will deepen the crisis of trust between citizens and the government. Similarly, using these technologies to increase policing, surveillance, and stigmatisation, will mean that individuals may choose to hide their health status or travel history from health authorities, putting themselves and others at risk, and ultimately hampering the collective efforts against the pandemic.

Also read: How Reliable and Effective Are the Mobile Apps Being Used to Fight COVID-19?

Mitigating this crisis of trust requires designing our legal and our technical systems in ways which prioritise democratic control and individual autonomy. At the outset, any intervention based on digital surveillance must take into account the limitations of such technologies, must be strictly deployed within public health systems instead of the security and policing apparatus, and must be routinely audited to see its suitability in the Indian context. Governments must also ensure that limited access to technologies does not lead to exclusion by ensuring that viable non-digital alternatives exist to any essential and pervasive digital intervention, including identification of affected individuals for testing or medical intervention, or for controlling movement and access to government services.

We must also design technical solutions which can be trusted by their users. Jurisdictions like the European Union have encouraged transparent, voluntary, decentralised and privacy-preserving mechanisms which ensure that the only data gathered from the apps is that which is strictly necessary for individuals to identify whether they have potentially contacted a COVID-19-positive individual, and which allows individuals to determine how to use such information, including whether to share it with health authorities. Other jurisdictions have also proposed legal frameworks which enhance transparency and trust in the use of technologies, such as legal mandates which ensure the independent oversight of the technologies, that data is used only for public health purposes, and that the surveillance tools are dismantled once the pandemic is over.

Digital technologies have been a tremendous resource for society in this time of crisis – allowing communities to build solidarity and offer mutual aid, and allowing us to continue social ties in the midst of a pandemic and a lockdown. However, we must be vigilant against the misguided reliance on technologies which exclude and which punish, which will imperil not only our responses to the pandemic, but the democratic values we cherish and savour.

An Ode to the Indian Worker Reading History,https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/an-ode-to-the-indian-worker-reading-history,"May 01, 2020  |  Janaki Nair","It would be dangerous indeed to sing out from our balconies on this May Day, ‘Arise ye prisoners of starvation! Arise ye wretched of the earth!’

Never in the recent past have these words had the grotesque salience that they have today for the millions of working people who are on the brink of starvation – for no fault of theirs except that they do indeed belong to the wretched of the earth.

So an altogether different ‘mayday’ call has been sent out by India’s workers, who had already been reeling under the body blows of a failing economy, when a public health crisis was compounded by colossal human miscalculation and callousness to bring about this avoidable catastrophe.

Irony indeed, that the call to commemorate the First of May as May Day in 1886 was to demand a shorter working day of 8 hours; Lenin in his inimitable manner had gone further in dividing the workers’ day into ‘8 hours of work, 8 hours of rest, and 8 hours of recreation’. Now it will be workers themselves who will refuse to make the supreme sacrifice they have repeatedly been asked, especially since that fateful day in November 2016, and now again in this moment of crisis. They will demand once more the right to work, perhaps any kind of work for any length of time, as a salve for the utter destitution they face.

They will, to adapt E.P. Thompson’s excellent essay on time discipline, certainly argue for and about time, rather than against it, as early industrial workers did. While the hyper visible and defiantly vocal middle class has been condemned to ‘luxurious idleness’, which the 1886 rallyists in Chicago had sought to end, the enforced non-work time brings neither rest nor recreation, but, when there is food aplenty, only hunger and distress to the working class.

Still, what will be the ‘Questions of the Worker Reading History’, after a century and a half of claiming their rights to a shorter work week, better paid jobs, affordable healthcare, some shelter, the means of bringing up children with better life chances? Not ‘why am I still here, the one who built those balconies from which you safely clap?’ No, it will be ‘You robbed us of work and wages, but why were we not even allowed to go home? Why rob us of the comfort of being among our loved ones? What of our dignity? Why were we made to frog leap, hop, bend, at gunpoint?’

The searing images of the long and humiliating walk home by lakhs of migrant workers, children on hips and heads, stumbling barefoot, sore and thirsty, dodging the state’s repressive apparatuses like criminals on the run, chastised like unruly law breakers: they will surely become the iconic napalmed-Vietnamese-child-running image of this lockdown.

So our workers have learned, as if they didn’t know this before, the harsh lesson of the Indian lockdown – that all lives are not equal, some lives, especially those who have balconies, are more precious than others. Our workers will ask, reading this history, ‘For years we demanded that we too partake of the Public Good – food, clothing, shelter, health, education – but since you did not let that happen, why are we shouldering the greater burden of this Public Bad?’ They will rightly ask, reading this history, ‘If you can give two days notice to people to remember to clap their hands, why only four hours to us to gather up our meager belongings and start walking?’

There will be no rallies on this May Day, no rousing calls to unite humanity itself, to save or free the human race. But we can and must learn from the bewildering changes that unfold around us – above all, that to ‘work from home’ is not an option for close to 500 million of our people. So perhaps this years’ May Day call should not be about rights at all, but about the compassion and empathy that India sorely needs to unite its people.

If our domestic workers – who knows how many, 4.2 million (official) or 50 (unofficial)? – enjoy a well earned rest today, it will be only if they are freed from worrying about being paid for this enforced holiday. The working poor, like the WFH rich, should be free at least to choose their place of being, at this time of deathly crisis. So let us mourn Jamalo Madkam, the 12 year old who died a few steps from her home after walking back from the chili fields of Telangana; let us grieve for Insaf Ali, who walked back to his door step in Shravasthi, UP from Mumbai, only to be quarantined to death. But let us celebrate the painful, but beautiful choice of Jadav Gogoi, who vows never to step out of his home after a gruelling 2800 km walk home to Assam from Ahmedabad. May he choose to ‘do one thing today and another tomorrow…hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner,’ just as he has a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic, and without ever turning into a wage slave again.

‘There have been concerns about religious tolerance and liberty in India, I hope the Prime Minister continues efforts to better protect the inalienable rights afforded to all people’, said the Virginia Senator after Modi’s address to Congress.

New Delhi: On Friday, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic party nominee for the presidency of the United States, announced that Virginia senator Tim Kaine would be her vice-presidential pick for the ticket to get elected to the world’s ‘most powerful job’.

Kaine’s home state has an important place in the political evolution of Indian-Americans. In the 2006 senate elections, Virginia’s front-runner Republican George Allen was captured on video calling an Indian-American man ‘Macaca’. The ‘strange insult’ was perhaps one of the reasons Allen lost his slim lead in the race to Democrat Jim Webb, with the mobilisation of Indian-Americans acknowledged to be the key for this result.

With a population of over 70,000 Indian-Americans, Virginia is among the top 10 US states with largest population of American citizens with Indian heritage.

Six years later when Webb retired, state governor Kaine got elected, again defeating republican challenger Allen, in the most expensive senate race till then. Kaine had already been assiduously courting the Indian-American community with key appointments and the community also reciprocated generously.

During his governorship, his handling of the 2007 Virginia Polytechnic campus shooting was noticed, especially when he rushed back from a trade mission to Japan and India. There were two Indian-origin fatalities among the 32 who were killed by a 23-year-old senior at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007.

While he was not in Capitol Hill during the years when the bill to implement the US-India nuclear agreement was pushed through, Kaine, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, has been a strong advocate of nuclear cooperation, even in the ‘plateau period’ when the Indian civil liability law seemed to have derailed it. He was, of course, a member of the Senate India caucus which was co-founded by Hillary Clinton in 2004.

In 2013, Kaine, who was one of the Obama administration’s important allies in Senate to back the Iran nuclear deal, had also wanted India to “eliminate or dramatically cut” its purchase of Iranian oil in order to put pressure on Tehran. He had suggested then the US could export LNG to India to reduce its dependence on the mid-east for its fuel security.

He visited India in the first year of Modi government in 2014 as and gushed upon his return that “this India-America moment is a wonderful one”.

The opportunities for cooperation are significant,” Kaine said in November 2014, adding that “we came back with such a powerful feeling that this India is”. He was the only US politician to be felicitated at an event with one of Obama administration’s highest profile Indian-American officials.

As a member of the India caucus and senate foreign relations panel, the Indian embassy, of course, has maintained a close working relationship with Kaine.

Kaine’s close ties with the financial and politically influential Asian Americans was very much visible. When the first super PAC was launched focusing exclusively on mobilising Asian Americans and Pacific islanders in January 2016, Tim Kaine was at the launch of the AAPI victory fund. The Asian-focus Super PAC is led by an Indian-American Shekhar Narasimhan.

After Prime Minister Modi’s address to a joint meeting of Congress in June this year, Kaine said that that the “strategic importance” of US-India relationship was growing every year, with emphasis on improving cooperation in defence issues, security in Indo-Asia Pacific region and climate change.

But, his felicitations also had a sting in its tail for the Bharatiya Janata Party:

“Some members of the Indian-American community in Virginia, many of whom are Sikh, have expressed concerns about issues of religious tolerance and liberty in India. I hope that Prime Minister Modi continues efforts to better protect the inalienable rights afforded to all people, just as we fight against expressions of religious intolerance in our own political climate,” noted Kaine.

He had also raised this issue during the hearing of senate foreign relations committee in May, just before Modi’s visit. He has also raised the issue of refusal of visas by the Indian government in March this year."
"Interview: Rajiv Kumar, NITI Aayog Chief, Defends Demonetisation",https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/rajiv-kumar-niti-aayog-chief-defends-demonetisation,"Nov 07, 2017  |  Karan Thapar","Speaking to The Wire, Kumar also defends the Modi government’s handling of GST, and its record on employment and GDP growth.

Karan Thapar: Hello and welcome to a very special interview with the vice chairman of NITI Aayog, Rajiv Kumar. November 8 is the first anniversary of demonetisation and a critical question we shall ask today is has it achieved its initial objectives or is it just a step too far to make that claim? That’s one of the key issues I shall discuss with Dr Kumar. I also want to talk to him about GST (Goods and Services Tax) and about ease of doing business. I want to talk to him about the government’s hopes to recapitalise banks and, of course, about the wider state of the economy.

Dr Kumar, let’s start with demonetisation. On November 8 last year when the prime minister made the announcement, he initially identified three objectives – tackling counterfeit money, tackling terror funding and black money. Subsequently, he added to that an attempt to reduce dependence on cash. Let’s start with the first two. I put it to you that in terms of tackling counterfeit money, and in terms of tackling terror funding, demonetisation has either failed or it hasn’t produced impressive results.

On counterfeit money

Rajiv Kumar: Neither, Karan. Because clearly there is much less counterfeit money and you’ll know that, you would know that by a visit to Kathmandu. Where a huge reservoir of counterfeit money was being produced – our neighbouring countries. And you will see that all the old sort of 500 and 1000 rupee notes are not in circulation any longer, and on the terror funding –

Thapar: Let’s take –

Kumar: And on the terror funding –

Thapar: I’ll come to terror funding in a moment, let me counter what you’re saying about counterfeit money. The government’s estimate of counterfeit money, as the government revealed in its Supreme Court affidavit, comes from the National Investigative Agency Survey of 2015. That survey says that at any one given point of time, only 400 crore of counterfeit money circulates in the economy, which is 0.028% of total currency. CNBC has calculated that only 0.0007% of the 1000 rupee notes that came in and only 0.002% of the 500 notes that came in were counterfeit. The total counterfeit was just 41 crores, which proves that either there was no counterfeit, or it hasn’t been detected. That is clear failure.

Kumar: No, not at all. Because the point is the initial estimate was made by 2015, you know, you wouldn’t know whether that was based on some firm data, and neither would you know the CNBC figures, because RBI hasn’t given out any figures. These are estimates, and specially, one of the reasons why the RBI hasn’t come out with the estimates is because the entire issue of currency circulating in Nepal is still being investigated.

Thapar: That’s one explanation. The other is that the RBI hasn’t come out with figures because it knows that if it were to do so it would actually be embarrassing because the proof would then be available, that very little, if any, counterfeit money was detected.

Kumar: Not at all, not at all, not at all. As I said to you earlier, the proof of the counterfeit money is that there are… You see, let me put it to you like this. The very fact that those two currency notes are not in circulation now, at this point of time, means that whatever counterfeit currency existed, is now gone. So where are we, why are we trying to do this, three decimal places or four decimal places –

Thapar: Well, yes. Now gone could mean not detected. Back into the system without being detected.

Kumar: No, no, it couldn’t be back in the system because it just doesn’t exist any longer. Those notes you will not take.

Thapar: Can I put this to you.

Kumar: Hang on, hang on

Thapar: You are surmising to defend the position of the government.

Kumar: No, no, just a second. Anybody using a 500 or a 1000 rupee currency note today cannot use it, right? So that if you had–

Thapar: But 99% of it has come back, so what I am saying is that, if it was counterfeit, it’s back in the system.

Kumar: Hello, hello, but the point is not that it has not come back to the system, at worst, it is sitting somewhere in the bank vaults, and is not in circulation.

Also read: The Vast Difference Between What Demonetisation Achieved and How it was Perceived

Thapar: Quite right, but it hasn’t been detected. The figures that I am quoting to you, done by CNBC, are based upon what the RBI put out on the 31st of August. RBI hasn’t put out –

Kumar: What are we more interested in? Are we more interested in the counterfeit money not being in circulation, or are we interested in the fact that the some people who had that counterfeit money may have now an equal amount in, in their –

Thapar: Well, if it’s the second then you’ve completely failed. Because if the counterfeit money has been put into banks and they’ve got proper money returned, it’s completely failed.

Kumar: No, no because the, because the use of cash is always through its velocity and not in its store. So what you don’t want is counterfeit money being circulated, you know, sloshing around the country.

Thapar: But what you also don’t want is counterfeit money being exchanged for real money, because then it becomes genuine.

Kumar: No, no of course not you don’t. But this is where, this is where you come to the point that all these are estimates, and I don’t think we should.. You know, given what you had said of 400 crore in 14.86 lakh crores..

Thapar: That is an estimate the government gave the Supreme Court in its affidavit.

Kumar: I think, I think this is a typical case of taking the speck and counting it as one of the stars. Why would you want to waste so much time in an interview?

Thapar: Except that is an estimate the government gave the Supreme Court in an affidavit.

Kumar: Why would you waste so much air time on an issue which doesn’t even.. in the tenth decimal place of the currency in circulation.

Thapar: Alright.

Kumar: And this just is a case of completely wrong priorities.

On terror funding

Thapar: Alright, let’s come then to the second thing, which is to do with terror funding. Now on September 1, just the day after the RBI had released information that pretty close to 99% of the money had come back into the system, the finance ministry issued a statement. And this is what it said, I am quoting, “As a result of demonetisation of specified bank notes, terrorist and Naxalite financing, stopped almost entirely.” No proof was given, so this is simply an assertion. The problem is, terror continues. We’ve had terror attacks on the BSF camp in Srinagar in October, we’ve had terror attacks in Pulwama in October, on the fourth of October. A terror attack, on the BSF camp near Srinagar airport, a nine-hour battle. By the way, as we are recording this interview, there’s a terror attack happening in Pulwama at this moment, on Saturday, at roughly 6 o clock. There was a terror attack in Pulwama in August, there was a terror attack on the Amarnath yatra, five killed. There was a terror attack in Pulgaon district in February, four dead. In fact, the South Asian terrorist portal, one of the most respected sites, says that deaths from terrorist fatalities have actually gone up by 8.5% this year compared to last. So clearly, terror funding hasn’t diminished. Or if it has, it only happened –

Kumar: But you’ve just quoted one state, what about the left-wing extremist activities?

Thapar: We don’t know anything about that at the moment, unfortunately.

Kumar: Okay good, because there will be none.

Thapar: Isn’t that a good –

Kumar: No, it’s not, there hasn’t been any, there hasn’t been any reported. But I think because of, I suppose your insistence on being sensationalist, you will insist on not seeing the positive, but only seeing the negative.

Thapar: I am not, I am not –

Kumar: You are free to do so.

Thapar: I am not being sensationalist.

Kumar: No no, you are.

Thapar: I am discussing –

Kumar: You are, because if you look at the incidence of terrorism, even in the state that you’ve quoted, it has come down appreciably. You could, of course, say that, “Oh this stone pelting was not because of you know, there is no funding involved there.” I don’t know what your defence would be there, but the fact that you don’t cite, or you don’t quote, the complete cessation of left-wing extremist activities, which was there before that, shows that there is a huge bias in what you are saying.

Thapar: There is not, I am quoting figures given by the government about Kashmir. In fact, Mr Ahir.

Kumar: But, but, but you’re not quoting–

Thapar: Mr Ahir has actually said in the parliament that the incidence of violence in Kashmir has gone up this year compared to last. I am only talking about terror, not violence.

Kumar: Hello, but that’s also terror. Or you don’t call the left-wingers terrorism?

Thapar: No, I am not talking about left wingers, I am saying incidence of violence in Kashmir.

Kumar: No, you didn’t say that to begin with.

Thapar: I did.

Kumar: You did not.

Thapar: You may have missed me but I did.

Kumar: No you did not, you said that the claim the government made was that one of the objectives of demonetisation was, to, you know, to attack terrorist funding.

Thapar: And the government said that it was ceased entirely, almost entirely.

Kumar: Almost is the operative word.

Thapar: But if terror continues –

Kumar: But the fact is that a large part of that activity was the funding of people out on the street, you know..

Thapar: And that you’re saying is stopped.

Kumar: Apparently so.

Thapar: Let’s then –

Kumar: Which you’ll not acknowledge.

Thapar: No, I am raising questions, it’s not for me to acknowledge or not acknowledge. Its for me to raise questions for you to answer.

Kumar: No, but the point is –

Thapar: I am presenting government facts.

Kumar: The point is, Karan the point is to raise questions which are unbiased. Rather than take it in a direction which, you know, which seems that there is a premeditated attempt at proving a step to be wrong –

Thapar: Dr Kumar –

Kumar: Which I have always supported.

Thapar: Dr Kumar, I am raising questions based on facts and figures that the government made available, first about counterfeit currency, and secondly about the incidence of terror or violence in Kashmir.

Kumar: But you know –

Thapar: I am not raising biased facts, these are government facts –

Kumar: My support for the demonetisation had always been that it was a huge attack on the pervasive culture of illegality and illegal income.

Thapar: Let’s come to that because that was the third big objective the Prime Minister set on the 8th of November, that it will tackle black money.

On black money

Kumar: It will tackle black money, but also to me, it would tackle this very pervasive and almost systemic culture, of legitimising illegal activities and, giving the private place to those who had earned money from wrong –

Thapar: You are identifying two things we will tackle. Let’s take them one by one so that the audience can understand. Let’s first take the target of eliminating or reducing black money. Now that we know that officially that almost 99% of the demonetised money is back in the system, the government has to identify what portion of it is black, and then, tax it. That means, it will take, first of all, years to do the identification, and secondly, you could end up with litigious court cases. At this moment, therefore, we don’t know how much will end up identifying as black and what the gain to the exchequer will be?

Kumar: Yeah, so how would you have gone about it otherwise? You know, I mean, there are people, I suppose you, you included those who would’ve rather had bonfires of currency and the currency floating down the rivers and the nalas in this country –which had started in the first week after the 8th of November, and which, if it had continued, would have meant social riots and bloodbaths in the streets because of the pervasiveness of the black. Hang on. Of the black currency, of the illegal currency in the system. Instead, what has happened, instead what has happened, that this, dubious, black currency etc. is now deposited in 80 lakh accounts, apparently.

Thapar: But how do you identify –

Kumar: Of which, of which..

Thapar: But how do you identify which is black and which is white, because that’s the challenge now.

Kumar: No, no. It is not. I therefore used the word dubious. Now what you’ve done therefore, or the CBDT has done, it is verified 13 lakh of those, and if you, I am telling you from data, that it has verified 13 lakh of those and issued notices to them, and in the end –

Thapar: No, that’s not on the basis of –

Kumar: And –

Thapar: Forgive me sir, those notices are not on the basis of verification, those are simply questions that are being asked.

Kumar: No, they are, that was, that was –

Thapar: The CBDT made that clear.

Kumar: That was done to the 18 lakh, and they have reduced that and done this to 13 lakh, of which for example, 4000 accounts have been actually seized as illegal and 5000 crore have been seized and not questioned and no litigation –

Thapar: Can I, can I –

Kumar: Just one second. Moreover, what the issue is that given the big data analytics and the technology that you have, this whole assumption, that this will take years and it will not get solved etc is wrong.

Thapar: But let me tell you why I make that assumption. It’s not one that I make myself. It’s made on the basis of what Sudhir Chandra, a former chairman of CBDT said to The Hindu in December last year. His exact words were that, “The CBDT only analyses 3 lakh accounts a year.” The prime minister has revealed that 18 lakh are under scrutiny, after that he’s also revealed that some 2.1 lakh companies are also closed down, this means that the total, at the rate of 3 lakh a year, will take the government six or seven years to do.

Kumar: No, why would you say that Sudhir Chandra did not tell you that there 30 crore, 300 million bank accounts opened in about 15 months. That was also done with using the technology –

Thapar: There’s a difference between opening an account and scrutinising to establish black money. Scrutiny is a more difficult process.

Kumar: The issue, the issue is the use of technology Karan, and the issue is not to assume a linearity from old times to new.

Thapar: No sir, what you–

Kumar: But, but –

Thapar: What the use of technology can do is to identify accounts where there are dubious or inexplicably large deposits, and therefore you raise questions about them. That doesn’t mean you actually identify that as black money. The identification requires some proof, the proof requires going into possibly court cases, because people will contest them, and that’s why the process can go on for 6-7 years.

Kumar: If on the other hand technology enables you to come up with proof and evidence which is not really contestable, and which the court will admit, doesn’t mean the court will carry on like that.

Thapar: You’re saying something very interesting. When you talked of 13 lakh accounts where notices have been sent, and you’re saying these are different to the 18 lakh where questions were asked. You’re actually revealing something that hasn’t been in the papers, you’re saying something completely new. So I am just going to question that, you are absolutely sure that there are 13 lakh accounts to which credible questions have been asked on the basis, not just of spot questioning, but on the real doubt that the money is black?

Kumar: That the money is dubious, and there are, there are questions about those accounts where the money has been deposited. And therefore Karan, what you’ve got is, about four and a half lakh crore of so-called black money, at least turned into grey. And not, and not this, you know, this talk that’s going on that everything is being turned from black to white etc. Hang on, just one second. The more important thing is also which, that the number of people submitting income tax returns has gone up from three and a half crore to nearly 6 crore this year.

Thapar: It’s very interesting on the income tax figure because, different elements of the government have made different statement about the size of the increase of the people filing income tax. The finance minister said, “91 lakh new people.” The prime minister in his Independence Day speech said 54 citing CBDT. But in the economic survey, the chief economic advisor said 5.4 lakh. So there’s a big difference, 91, 54, 5.4 –

Kumar: Because that was in February 2017, what the figure that Mr Jaitley gave you is probably September. And the figure that I am giving you is around October of 20th. And that number, the fact remains that for some godforsaken reason, you guys are not giving demonetisation the credit for cleaning up this economy, for cleaning up this economy and reversing this huge, immoral activity of generating black money.

Thapar: Credit cannot be given if information is not shared. You have made available for the first time details about this 13 lakh bank accounts, to which specific, detailed queries have been made, these are no longer questions being asked, as in the case of the 18 lakh. This is something new being revealed for the first time –

Kumar: Because Karan –

Thapar: You need to share information for people to appreciate that you have done something.

Kumar: That is being done, except of course, I think very often that people look at information, sort of rather in a, you know, rather in a biased manner or –

Thapar: No no, forgive me, information can only be looked at with bias, if its available to look at, in this instance, what you’ve revealed is so new, I didn’t know it, it’s not been in the papers, and I am accepting it as a fact, because you’ve told me, you’re vice chairman of NITI Aayog – and its a credible thing you’re saying, that 13 lakh accounts have been specifically identified, not simply to ask spot questions, but to be proceeded against, which means actually there is a case there, where you do some processing. And therefore, there’s good reason to believe this is black money. That is definitely something to the government’s credit, I wish the government had made it public, but you made it public.

Kumar: Part, the government.

On reducing dependence on cash

Thapar: Absolutely, but you’re doing it in an interview where mercifully, and thankfully, you’re giving me news. Let’s come to the fourth objective identified by the prime minister, which was to reduce dependence on cash. Now, there is no doubt that after the first few months after November the 8th last year, digital transactions, both in terms of number and value, did go up, fairly sharply. But then they began to decline thereafter, March onwards. And I am not denying that, in fact, there’s been some success. But I am saying that it’s not spectacular or dramatic. There has been success –

Kumar: How do you define spectacular or dramatic? By the way, and use your definition carefully Karan, how do you define spectacular or, what did you, what is the other word you used?

Thapar: Dramatic

Kumar: Dramatic, in the case of a reduction of cash to GDP ratio.

Thapar: Let me, let me give you the digital transactions.

Kumar: No, what would you define as spectacular.

Thapar: Let me give you the digital transactions – 671.49 million in November, rising to 957.50 million in December, that was the high point, and then they shrunk back by July, August to 862.3. So I am not denying that they have gone up, but having gone up, they’ve also come down.

Kumar: The fact of the matter, however, is that the cash to GDP ratio in this economy, which is one of the highest in the world, about 12.4 or 12.3%, has come down to 10.8%. And that the economic activity has begun to increase again. So there you are. The, use of cash, and I repeat myself, the pervasive culture, of illegality, has been attacked.

Thapar: Except for the fact that shopkeepers are now reporting, not just from major towns like Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Chennai, but also from small mofussil towns and certainly from even villages, from where PoS machines were in use immediately after demonetisation, that now, people prefer to pay in cash. And these people, who’ve invested in those machines are now complaining that they are not getting the return that they had hoped for. They are in the papers.

Kumar: I haven’t seen –

Thapar: They’ve been reports in the papers, in the Economic Times and the Business Standard.

Kumar: Well, I, these, these anecdotes don’t mean anything to me, because I am giving you, solid numbers. And the fact is that India has for the first time in 20 years seen a reversal in the use of cash, as compared to the GDP figures.

Thapar: So, just to sum up..

Kumar: And this is, this is very big deal.

Thapar: So, just to sum up, clearly you are saying to me – I am asking you to establish whether I have understood you correctly. You are clearly saying to me that in terms of reducing dependence on cash, demonetisation has been very successful, the cash to GDP ratio has come down from 12 to 10.8%. That, if true ..

Kumar: Not 12, 12.4%.

Thapar: 12.4 to 10.8%.

Kumar: These are important numbers –

Thapar: Absolutely, and that is a substantial reduction.

Kumar: Yes.

Thapar: Right? However, in terms of black money, I have accepted what you said, that 13 lakh accounts have been identified, they have been proceeded against, that is the case the government has to pursue. That being the case, that is also, I deem it, a success.

Kumar: Yes.

Thapar: When it comes to counterfeit currency being identified –

Kumar: You will continue –

Thapar: The government statistics suggest a different thing.

Kumar: You will continue to rattle the little toy that you have.

Thapar: But it’s not the little toy, it’s the government’s figures.

Kumar: No, no.

Thapar: The government’s figures given to the Supreme Court.

Kumar: This is a typical case of a person having said, “Oh I’ve admitted to the two big ones, but I must have my little say.” Okay, go ahead.

Thapar: Well it’s kind of you to be so generous in putting it that way. But you’re not being generous, you’re trying to belittle me, but that’s your prerogative. That’s your prerogative and I grant you that.

Kumar: Your prerogative is to try and prove that the demonetisation, which I think is one of the most historical steps that this government has taken and has had the courage to do so. You will continue to deny the credit, for, I don’t know which reason.

Thapar: I am not denying credit, I am asking questions. You’re assuming that behind the questions is a denial of credit.

Kumar: Because –

Thapar: I am asking –

Kumar: Because of the nature of the questions.

Thapar: No, the object of the question is to put the opposite of your viewpoint to you. It would not be an interview, it would not be an interview if I give you lollipops.

Kumar: No, of course.

Thapar: The idea is to challenge you, not to present your case to you.

Kumar: You could’ve challenged me, and we could have discussed in much greater detail, is why four and a half lakh crore of money in dubious accounts is probably equal to the amount that was swirling around in illegal economy.

On impact of demonetisation on economic growth

Thapar: Let me put this to you, beyond the four objectives, that we’ve discussed, there is also another element of demonetisation that concerns people, and that is the hit to growth, the hit – to jobs and the human suffering. Let’s leave human suffering out, because people who stood in queues have done it and that’s over with.

Kumar: And, supported it. While standing in queues, in the sun, unlike us, who were in our air-conditioned comforts and continued to crib.

Thapar: However, since then its emerged, that growth has stepped down to 5.7% –

Kumar: Demonetisation –

Thapar: And the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy claims that in the months from January to March, something like 1.5 million jobs were lost.

Kumar: You should’ve been there to overhear the conversation between the chief statistician Dr TCA Anant and Mahesh Vyas, where Mr Anant pointed out to him that, “Did you take the seasonality into your account, Mahesh?” There was no answer.

Thapar: So you are saying that CMIE was wrong, and that they made a basic error, of not taking seasonality into account.

Kumar: Yes, and please consult, and contact the chief statistician of the country. Hang on, the second one–

Thapar: Can I just –

Kumar: No no, I must answer this.

Thapar: Okay, happily.

Kumar: As Meghnad Desai, one of our good economists has pointed out, “Demonetisation lasted for six weeks precisely, and after that remonetisation had begun.” And therefore –

Thapar: Dr Kumar –

Kumar: And therefore, therefore, all this talk about despotic act –

Thapar: Dr Kumar –

Kumar: And loot and plunder, I think it’s just, it’s just–

Thapar: Dr Kumar, as we talked, the Business Standard for the last three days has been doing surveys of critical industries, that they believe reflect the way in which small businesses have been hit by demonetisation. They’ve done a survey of the leather industry in Kanpur, the knitwear industry, they’ve done a survey of the hosiery industry in Ludhiana and regularly they do surveys of the textile industry in Surat. It seems cumulative from the surveys –

Kumar: Add the diamond industry –

Thapar: It seems cumulatively that the losses, just in these four sectors, are in tens of thousands. Cumulatively it might mean –

Kumar: Losses of what?

Thapar: Jobs.

Kumar: Oh.

Thapar: People laid off, tens of thousands. You could even say it adds up to perhaps a hundred thousand. Now, these are people who have lost their livelihood.

Kumar: And these are people who are now earning their livelihood, livelihood in legal formalised sectors of the economy. And these are people who will not be supporting, you know, the black, the generation of the black economy in the country. Hang on. Am I hearing from Karan, that he really supported people working in the parallel economy? And not, and not, you know, contributing, to this economy?

Thapar: Karan, Karan, is not making a statement of who he supports. Karan is asking questions to suggest that in fact, the hit on growth, and the hit on jobs is pretty sizeable, even though some of the gains haven’t materialised as yet. They may down the road when the black money is detected and the tax paid and the exchequer gains.

Kumar: The biggest gain –

Thapar: But at the moment, the losses are apparent, the gains are not.

Kumar: The biggest gain is, and I repeat myself, one, I am not repeating myself – to start the process of formalising the economy and pushing back, the whole, the whole, black, parallel illegal economy. And the biggest, and the other big gain is that there is for the first time, those who were working honestly and earning an honest living can hold up their heads, and not be having to say that those who, you know, just become rich somehow are my social icons.

Thapar: I am happy to say, amen to that, but let me quote to you the Business Standard and The Economist. The Business Standard said on September 1, “Demonetisation was a blunder, poorly thought through and badly executed.” The Economist, in the most recent issue, which came out earlier this week, says, “It caused great hardship and disruption, without any clear benefit.”

Kumar: Completely disagree, and I think these are the people, who for some, I don’t know their motives, but I think they are, they are people who are not in favour of this, the Indian economy, getting on to a sustained, transparent, clean, and you know a legal basis.

Thapar: So these are biased opinions?

Kumar: Absolutely.

On ease of doing business

Thapar: Alright, let’s leave demonetisation aside, let’s come to the good news we’ve had this week, about ease of doing business. There’s no doubt, that when it was announced that India’s ranking had moved in just three years, from 142 –

Kumar: The Business Standard has endorsed it I suppose.

Thapar: Not just the Business Standard, everyone in the country has endorsed it.

Kumar: Including the Business Standard?

Thapar: But you have to still let me ask the question, because you are still suggesting, that I am asking questions, not as an interviewer, who’s presenting facts that are awkward, but because there is a bias in me. And that, I question, but you have a right to think I am biased, I am simply questioning it. Let’s come back to the –

Kumar: When somebody quotes to a single source all the time, and not other sources–

Thapar: I haven’t quoted a single source all the time–

Kumar: No, but you did for the last, last whatever minutes.

Thapar: No, I quoted the Business Standard once to you just now and I quoted The Economist as well. It’s not all the time, just once. Just once.

Kumar: We’ll have to rewind and see that you’ve done it before.

Thapar: I haven’t done it in this interview. I may have done it conversationally, and some other time, but not in this interview. But anyway, let’s come to ease of doing business. There’s no doubt that when India’s ranking improved in just three years from 142 to a 100, that was a remarkable achievement. And in fact the vice president of the World Bank has said so in so many words. On the other hand –

Kumar: There you are –

Thapar: On the 30th of October, sitting beside Arun Jaitley, Sunil Bharti Mittal, one of India’s highly regarded industrialists said, and I am quoting him, “The ease of doing business remains a major concern.” And the example he gave was that in Ghana, in just three days, you can get permission for a merger, even though one of the companies is based in the Netherlands. In India, he said, even when both companies are wholly Indian, permission for a merger can take over five months. So my question is that beyond the ranking, which we are all very pleased with, is there actually a genuine change on the ground? Cause Mr Mittal is suggesting there isn’t.

Kumar: Yeah. So, in the ease of doing business, there are several aspects. One let me say, that ranking is different from a score, and there are ten different categories that ease of business has. And a country like India’s score towards the, towards the, you know, the frontier has been improved in nine out of ten, as it has done in this case, and yet, its ranking may not show that, because others may have improved as well. So ranking is relative, score is absolute and we should’ve looked at the score, you know, in looking at these things. First point. The second point, of course, is that, we’ve just improved from 136 to 100, we are not yet there in the top ten.

Thapar: 142 actually, if you combine full three years.

Kumar: Yeah, 136 last year and 142 before. 136 was questioned because you know, the base is not the same etc. Nonetheless, we are still 100 on those rankings. That means that there is a lot more to do. And this is being done. And, for example, in one of those cases, we’ve become, we’ve actually declined, due to enforcement of contracts – now that’s a judicial problem. Now that problem is – exist with us, for years to come because there is a new ball game out there.

Thapar: In fact, it’s just not a decline in terms of enforcing contracts, when it’s a question of starting businesses, our position is 156.

Kumar: Yes.

Thapar: Out of 190, that’s pretty bad.

Kumar: Hang on.

Thapar: When its the question of construction permits, we’re 181.

Kumar: Can I –

Thapar: Can I just, can I just finish, there are many areas, where in fact, we are not making it easy to do business.

Kumar: Has anybody in the government made the claim that the ease of doing business work is, we have achieved what we wanted to achieve?

Thapar: But you haven’t let me finish the question, the question I was putting to you is the one that arose on social media, and I think it’s also being brought up by one or two columnists in papers. That because there are simply ten areas where in fact your score, your ranking is judged –

Kumar: Nine out of Ten.

Thapar: Now, now, you can actually, concentrate on just those and game the system. And the question that was raised, and I am putting it to you, is was there a sense in which, and this not a criticism, was there a sense in which we very clearly gamed the system and identified areas that we can target, get improvement on and make sure our ranking goes up?

Kumar: In positive terms, if you care to, if you look at it that way, it’s also called going after the low hanging fruits. And that is supposed to be clever, and that is not just –

Thapar: I am just asking, did we do that?

Kumar: We went for the low hanging fruits that we could achieve. Now we can’t change the judiciary overnight, you and I know that. But, but, the more important one, cause that’s where I know a lot of improvement has been done – it’s on starting the business. What has happened is that, you, the respondents are prima – principally, a great majority of them are those who are already in business. A very small segment of those as a percentage of the business sample, come from those which have just started the business last year. So, this comes out of memory of those who have been in business for a few years, and you will see, that there will be a radical this year, or the year after as newer entrepreneurs who have benefitted from the changes, get sampled and interviewed.

Thapar: That’s what I want to ask you about, because if you look at the ranking of other countries, The Botswanas and Zambias are in the mid 80’s. Bhutan is at 75. Rwanda, and most Indians won’t even know where Rwanda is, Rwanda is at 41.

Kumar: Sure.

Thapar: When are we going to catch up with them?

Kumar: I don’t know. I can’t say, it depends upon what they do and what we do. But we are going to try for sure.

Thapar: But they are doing something terribly right.

Kumar: We are going to try for sure, and we are going to fulfil the prime minister’s objective, of being in the top 50, within the next few years. And, and–

Thapar: Well, actually, in 18 months.

Kumar: No, and by the way, a lot of it, and this is where, I honestly believe that comparing Rwandas and Botswanas and Mozambiques, or whoever, or Ghanas is so completely out of place Karan.

Thapar: But that’s what this system does.

Kumar: Hang on, hang on just a second.

Thapar: This system does, this system does it –

Kumar: Yes, because you are a continental economy, and all of those indices are much more dependent on the state governments than on Delhi. And therefore to pull them all along, if Rwa – you know, if you, I mean, this is where I just fail to understand why our learned interviewers and columnists fail to –

Thapar: Don’t turn it now to your learned interviewers, but thank you for the compliment, you’ve called me learned, which is an adjective that I am flattered by, but actually, what you are suggesting. Let me finish professor Kumar. What you are suggesting is that don’t pay too much attention to the ranking between different countries, because actually, we’re a continent-sized economy, Rwanda is a small little, wee little state. Right? Bhutan is even smaller. The problem is that actually it is the government that pays huge attention to the ranking, and the government wants its ranking to go up. You’re saying the opposite of the government, you’re saying, don’t pay attention to ranking, the government pays nothing but attention.

Kumar: I am saying that the effort required to move an oil tanker, learned interviewer, is far bigger than to turn a little, small dingy around. And there, you have to appreciate that, and for the first time in 70 years you’ve got the central government getting 29 governments on the same page and filling up, and putting their data on the portal, around 98 variables, telling us where they, how they are trying to improve the ease of doing business.

Bullet train

Thapar: Alright, you honourable interviewee, I hope you allow me to be Chinese and repay you the compliment. Let’s come to another subject. An issue that is in the news, it’s one that has captured the imagination of the Indian people is the bullet train. Now there’s a debate among economists, some say, that in a country where 30% live below the poverty line and where many begin to feel that perhaps the railway system, particularly in terms of safety, is now in a state of shambles, a bullet train is the wrong priority. Others say, given India’s ambitions, this is the right sort of investment to make for the future. Where do you, as chairman of NITI Aayog, come in on this debate?

Kumar: On the latter, because I saw the same criticism being made on Rajiv Gandhi when he wanted to introduce laptops into the system.

Thapar: And it was the BJP that said, ‘We want, we want, potato chips, not computer chips.’ I am just putting that in because it was the BJP and L.K. Advani who made that criticism.

Kumar: Having flattered me by calling me a professor, honourable interviewer, don’t bring in now spurious and extraneous activity.

Thapar: It is not spurious, extraneous I believe.

Kumar: You asked me a question, I gave you a straight answer.

Thapar: Go ahead, go ahead.

Kumar: For an economy, which is aspiring to be on the frontline of global technology, and which is aspiring to leapfrog the technological, you know, stages, that are, you know, in front of us –

Thapar: This is a wise investment?

Kumar: This is a very wise, symbolic investment.

Thapar: Let me then put two concerns about this to you, and again, these are concerns that have been in the media. The first is to do with the fact that the prime minister has made a lot of the fact that Japan is giving us a loan for some $13.5 billion, which is roughly 88,000 crore in rupees – for a 50 year period, at an interest rate of just 0.1%. And the prime minister said in one of his speeches, this is practically as good as free.

Kumar: Biswajit Bhattacharyya in The Wire –

Thapar: But let me finish my question, and then you can answer it. And you’re absolutely right, I will end up at some point quoting him, but not at this moment. At this moment, I am saying something else. The point I am making is this, the prime minister thinks that an interest rate of 0.1% is practically free, but if you know, as you do, that the Tokyo Interbank offer rate is 0.06%, and Japanese government bonds barely get a yield of 0.04%. In Japanese terms, an interest rate –

Kumar: You’re good at quoting decimal figures.

Thapar: But I can’t help it, cause that’s how the Japanese system works. That’s not my problem with them. But in Japanese terms, a 0.1% interest rate is making good money. Because actually, there they charge 0.06%. Yields are 0.04%, so I put it to you, when the prime minister says this is as good as free, is he mistaken, or is his description misleading?

Kumar: You got it completely wrong. You know, and the reason is that if you are a millionaire, and you have your marginal utility of – I hope you are conversant with that view, with that concept, a marginal utility –

Thapar: I am not conversant, unfortunately, with being a millionaire, I would like to be, but I am not.

Kumar: I am, I am sure you are conversant with both. Being a millionaire and with the marginal utility of money declining as your money goes, money increases. You’re giving me a thousand rupees, means nothing to you at all. But me receiving a thousand rupees, the poor government servant that I am, means hell of a lot. So, in a country where the rate of discounts, social discount, and rate of interest that the government pays is more than 8%, receiving something at 0.1% is practically free money. Moreover Karan, the fact is that if you look at the social discount rate at 6-8 or whatever percent and extend it for 50 years, the net present value of 18,000 crore would actually turn out to be zero.

Thapar: That would work perfectly, but for the fact that we aren’t sure what will happen to the rupee, vis a viz depreciation against the yen. This is where –

Kumar: And Biswajit Bhattacharyya, I know what you’re –

Thapar: Sir, sir, but the audience doesn’t. It’s only fair that the audience should hear the questions, so that they know what you’re answering. Biswajit Bhattacharyya has pointed out that in fact the great danger could be that if the rupee depreciates against the yen, India’s debt burden could escalate hugely. He points out and I am making this point for the audience, that in fact today, the rupee –

Kumar: You’re misleading the audience.

Thapar: Let me, you can answer that when I’ve made the question. He points out, in an article for The Wire that one rupee today buys 1.72 yen – ten years ago it bought 2.80, in 85 it bought 19.77. And he says that if the rupee similarly depreciates over the next 50 years, we will be returning to Japan not the 88,000 crore we borrowed, but arguably, possibly, 300,000 crore, and that’s not counting the interest.

Kumar: What a foolish recession to have made. Because that, the basic assumption there is, that your currency will continue to depreciate, at the same rate, that it did for the last 32 years. Without recognising the fact, and I don’t know, I have not met Biswajit, hang on, without recognising the fact that as economies grow, productivity improve, and as productivity improves, as happened in the case of Japan for example, in 1964, it was I think it was nearly 380 yen to the dollar, and it has now come to the lowest. It came down to 84 yen to the dollar. The same thing happened to the Chinese currency, why should Mr Biswajit Bhattacharyya assume, even for a minute, that if we are going to achieve our growth rates going forward, our currency will not stabilise –

Thapar: So clearly –

Kumar: And improve.

Thapar: There’s a gamble or an assumption.

Kumar: No, no.

Thapar: On the a) stabilisation and b) on the improvement of our currency vis a viz the yen. And assuming it will be in our favour, not against us, that’s an assumption.

Kumar: The only assumption, the only assumption, Karan here is that you will achieve your target, of, of your GDP growing by the, by by much higher amount, and your productivity improving. Remember, Japan is already, at more than, nearly $15,000 per capita. Their productivity improvements cannot be as high as yours. Cause you’ve got a huge gain here. So that Bhattacharyya assumption is completely false.

Thapar: You are maybe right in saying that his assumptions are false, but all doubt will be removed, if instead of relying on a Japanese loan, we had used $13 billion, out of our $400 billion-plus reserves. Should that not have been the preferred route?

Kumar: Not in a, not in a world where your northern neighbour has about $4 trillion in reserves, and uses that war chest against you all over the place, in all sorts of geo-strategic manner. This is talking out of your head.

Thapar: So Chinese –

Kumar: And this is why Raghuram Rajan has said that it is better not to touch your reserves, cause these reserves are your guarantee, that you will not get the shock of people moving out, and your portfolios moving out, and you will not get into an external finance problem.

Thapar: So you endorse, as far as this point is concerned, Raghuram Rajan’s position about using reserves.

Goods and Services Tax

Kumar: Of course, of course.

Thapar: Let’s then come to GST –

Kumar: And I hope Biswajit Bhattacharyya also uses that.

Thapar: Alright. Let’s now come, to GST. You know better than me that there are great concerns about the number of rates, there are great concerns about, the way those rates equate with individual items, there’s great concern about the fact that small companies have to go through cumbersome procedures which they find difficult to handle. And finally, there’s great concern about the efficiency and functioning of the GST and network. And this has led many people to say the government shouldn’t have rolled out GST on the 1st of July. It should have waited till September so that the system was more prepared and ready. So that these problems were hopefully eradicated. Did the government roll out GST somewhat hastily?

Kumar: No, not at all. And the only thing is that one must recognise that policymaking is the art, is is, the art of, the best, making the best in the world –

Thapar: You’re suggesting policymaking is trial and error?

Kumar: No! I am just suggesting that the first best answer would have been a single rate, as everybody has said, including the Kelkar Committee, which first proposed GST, I think about 11 years ago or something. But policymaking is to find the best in the world of second best. And and this is where, just a second, just a second, see achieving a consensus across all our states and getting there is like putting your foot in the door and opening your door to the biggest historical change, both in economic and political terms – and the fact that the GST counsel is acting, is responding sensitively, means that you would get to the first best.

Thapar: Dr Kumar, your argument would be very convincing, but for the fact that since GST was rolled out in January,on the first of July, we’ve had over 40 amendments and notifications, over a hundred cases, the rate has changed. Clearly, to many people this suggests, proper, careful, meticulous thinking was not done in advance. It was hastily rolled out, and now, the government is having to correct, what it should have actually put in the place the first time. And by the way, there is another GST council meeting on the 9th and 10th, where more amendments and corrections will happen. So that’s my point, shouldn’t more time have been spent, more effort made?

Kumar: They will continue, because in a case as complicated as GST being applied to, you know, again, to assert again, on a continentally diverse economy, there will not be ever a situation where you would have been able to work out, everything in advance. Because there are, millions of commodities, millions of products –

Thapar: So it’s better to start and get it a little wrong and correct it, rather than wait to get it perfect because you can never get it perfect.

Kumar: It’s better to start, and, and having waited 17 years, have the courage to do so.

Thapar: In other words, don’t make the perfect, the enemy of the good.

Kumar: Touche.

Thapar: Let me put it like this, there’s a lot of concern about the impact of GST on exporters and exports, and on small businesses. How serious are those concerns?

Kumar: The concern about the exporters is very serious, and which is why the council, actually, removed that. And exempted the exporters from registering under the GST and –

Thapar: And the small businesses? And the jobs that they create?

Kumar: The small businesses already have a lot of exemptions. There is a whole scheme of composite GST whereby they can just pay 5% and and not even file their returns monthly. These small businesses have been a special focus of this government, that they are not harmed.

Thapar: But actually the composite scheme eligibility is to be increased from one crore to 1.5. And the taxation is to be reduced to a flat 1%. All of that is a proposal for the 9th, so it seems that even now further changes are needed, to secure small businesses.

Kumar: Because as the government sees.. Look the GST council actually is responding with so much alacrity and so positively –

Thapar: After the problems created, couldn’t they have foreseen the problem and acted in advance?

Kumar: This is, this is exactly what I am trying to tell you, Karan, that you cannot foresee everything in as complex a subject as GST.

Thapar: So this was inevitable?

Kumar: And the complexity has arisen because of your attempt to get equity into the picture. You could have said, hang on, you could have said, flat 12% or 15%, and be done with it. You didn’t, why did you not do it? Because you said, “Oh, there are millions and millions of people.”

Thapar: I can’t be unfair to the poor, hence I make it more complicated. Hence there will be problems. And you’re saying–

Kumar: Would you rather not do that?

Thapar: And you’re saying to me that these problems were not just inevitable, but they couldn’t have been foreseen and, attended to, in advance.

Kumar: Given the complex structure that you chose to go with, in the interest of equity. And I cannot see anybody, and I cannot see anybody challenging the government for having safeguarded equity in this economy.

On the state of the economy

Thapar: There are, by the way, many who write newspaper columns who’ve done that, but leave that aside, they’ll defend themselves, I am just pointing it out for the audience. Let’s come quickly, because we are running out of time, to the general state of the economy. Since May, sorry, I beg your pardon, since, March of last year, right? The growth of the economy has fallen fairly considerably, from something like 9.1% to 5.7%. Over a similar period of time, manufacturing has declined from 10.8% to 7.9%. Construction from 5% to 1.7%, whilst the value of stalled projects has gone the other way. It’s increased from 10.7 lakh crore to 13.2 lakh. Now you know better than me, that gross fixed capital formation is stuck somewhere at 38.4%, bank credit –

Kumar: 38% is too high –

Thapar: It’s even lower?

Kumar: Oh yes, because 38% was the peak.

Thapar: So there you are, it’s even lower.

Kumar: 38%, oh 38% is the peak, and you know, it has come down unfortunately.

Thapar: You’re making my point for me now, and I am very grateful for that and bank credit growth is just marginally above 5%.

Kumar: Public sector bank credit growth –

Thapar: Absolutely.

Kumar: Please correct yourself. And, and growth from the HDFC –

Thapar: But the question I am asking you is how do you, as vice chairman of Niti Aayog, view this economic picture?

Kumar: I am very troubled by the fact that the economy had gone down, but we did start this government’s tenure with a legacy of 4.1% – is what we were handed over. After the BJP government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee handed over to UPA a growth rate of 8.3%. Now, rather than quote 9.3%, you could’ve said –

Thapar: Under the way of calculating GDP, 4.1% went up considerably higher but you’re not using that.

Also read: Even the Optimism of Official Economists Cannot Ignore the Warning Signs

Kumar: No, in the last three years, the average is 7.1%. I’ve said this many times, I have seen the economy bottoming out in July. And that, you know, the last, the first quarter number that you got at 5.7%, is the result of many contingent facts, includin –

Thapar: Will the next quarter be higher?

Kumar: Absolutely.

Thapar: What do you think it’ll be? I know I am asking you to guess, but roughly.

Kumar: About 6.2%.

Thapar: And what do you think we’ll achieve for the year as a whole by March of 2018?

Kumar: Nearly 7%.

Thapar: Nearly 7%. So it’ll actually be under 7%? Nearly 7% means under 7%.

Kumar: About 7%.

Thapar: About 7%. 6.8%, 6.9%?

Kumar: 7.1% maybe.

Job creation

Thapar: Okay, another key concern is to do with jobs. One frequently hears commentary that India is simply not creating enough jobs, and now, depending upon whether you go by newspaper, anecdotal reports, or you go by the centre for monitoring the Indian economy, jobs are also being lost. How worried are you about the job front?

Kumar: I am so worried about the job front that in NITI Aayog we have just started the process of trying to collect as much high-frequency data as we can to get a better handle on what’s happening to the jobs.

Thapar: Do we not have good data on jobs?

Kumar: We don’t. Unfortunately, not. And in all these –

Thapar: Can I ask you why do we not have good data?

Kumar: Because, we the elite, you and me don’t give a damn about those who are not employed. That’s it.

Thapar: Well this is actually the irresponsible attitude of our class or our –

Kumar: Because why wouldn’t you have had employment data once in five years otherwise? Tell me that.

Thapar: So, the –

Kumar: NSSO comes up with this very thick round, where he gets the actual data, once in five years and then thin data, once in two years. Why would you have not got the data?

Thapar: So you’re actually saying to me that we do not have a good idea, of how many people have jobs and how many people don’t.

Kumar: And this is why my predecessor, Arvind Panagariya, shared a task force, set up by this government, to try and collect much better data, and that’ll be coming out next year.

Thapar: I tell you why I am surprised by what you’re saying because you’re making it crystal clear, we do not have a good handle or hold, on how many jobs exist and how many don’t. How many are being created, and how many not. But just –

Kumar: Especially because a lot of jobs are being created on contract basis which has been legalised, and yet not reflected perhaps.

Thapar: But how do you know they are being created on that basis when you also say to me that we don’t have a proper idea about what the job situation is? You can’t say both things.

Kumar: No you can, because you can make some estimates. Which is what I said –

Thapar: Estimates or assumptions?

Kumar: Estimates, very different from assumptions.

Thapar: I’ll tell you why I asked that question.

Kumar: Now hang on, just a minute.

Thapar: Sure.

Kumar: The EPFO figure says that their numbers have gone up by about ten million this year. You know, this is employment, EPFO is the Employment Provident Fund Organisation. Similar figures come out of ECI etc. And for example, let’s, if there are, if there are let’s say, I don’t know where to get the numbers, that if there are for example, you know, a hundred thousand trucks sold every month, they would need drivers. I don’t see that data anywhere.

Thapar: Well yes, and that’s an assumption. But let me put it like this, why I asked you this question, seven to eight weeks ago, Amit Shah said at a rally, that something like seven or eight crore jobs had been created in the unorganised sector. Where he got that figure from, he didn’t say. And, let me just, let me just finish. He made this statement, it was picked up by the papers and he is president of the BJP. In May, when Bandaru Dattatreya, speaking as labour minister, as he was then, said the following, ” The current growth is jobless growth. Growth is being reported, but it is not reflecting in employment generation.” Now, either Mr Shah is right, or Mr Dattatreya was right, but they both can’t be correct.

Kumar: I of course can’t comment on either one of them. What I can say that as the vice chairman of the NITI Aayog, which is the body which is responsible for getting better data in the economic system, we have started a process with the help of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme implementation, to collect much better data, you know, through our –

Thapar: And you are seriously worried about the job front, as you said a moment ago?

Kumar: I am, I am more seriously worried about getting the right data so as to know whether there is, whether there is, how big is the problem, it could be big –

Thapar: When will you have the data?

Kumar: Next year, I think around this time.

Thapar: So we will be in state of semi-limbo till next year this time?

Kumar: As we’ve been for the last 70 years.

Thapar: As we’ve been for the last 70 years. But it will take another full year, before you, as vice chairman are happy, that you’ve got the data and taken a step.

Kumar: But in the meantime, as I told you, to begin with, I am trying to plug this gap, by collecting as much high-frequency data as I can, using big data analytics for it, I have set up a group with some of the best minds in the country, to help me with that and you will see numbers coming out of NITI Aayog, before the end of this year.

Thapar: So this is a key priority, for Rajiv Kumar.

Kumar: This is a key priority for the government. Because for our young population, their aspirations must be met, and the only way to meet them is to get them productive, good quality jobs.

Thapar: Rajiv Kumar –

Kumar: And this is why, we’ve had the MUDRA, the MUDRA scheme as well.

Thapar: Rajiv Kumar, on that point, we have to end this interview, unfortunately, we don’t have time to raise questions about the recapitalisation of banks. That we’ll have to leave for another occasion. But we’ve been through, fairly comprehensively, all the subjects we’ve touched on, and I am deeply grateful for the time you’ve given me.

Kumar: Honourable Mr Karan."
The Mystifying Experience of Being Muslim in India,https://m.thewire.in/article/communalism/the-mystifying-experience-of-being-muslim-in-india,"Apr 21, 2016  |  Mohammad Azeemullah","My father, Munshi Abdul Mabood, was a government employee in the department of posts in Bihar. He was a Muslim.

In 1947, he did not migrate to Pakistan as he did not feel threatened by the post-partition communal flare-up in the country. He did not even know why India was divided.

As time passed by, he came to understand that the goal of partition was to create an India for Hindus and a Pakistan for Muslims. I don’t know how he came to learn this but the belief left him shaken. Was he now a stranger in his own land?

Without protest but with a heavy heart, he wrote out an application as a possible nominee to migrate to Pakistan and submitted that to a local office. He then began to wait for approval from the government.

Migration to Pakistan was not an easy task by then. It involved great risks of physical and mental pain. The waiting, and the uprooting which lay ahead weighed heavily on him. His face grew longer by the day.

One morning, Harihar Thakur, a practicing Hindu working in the same postal department, noticed my father in low spirits. He was inquisitive and asked the reason.

When Harihar came to know about my father’s plan to migrate to Pakistan, he got furious and said fervently in Bhojpuri: ‘Sab Musalman ke Pakistan jaye ke zaroori na ba‘ meaning ‘all Muslims need not necessarily go to Pakistan’.

My father did not know about the alternative being given to Muslims – that they could choose between India and Pakistan. He was oblivious of politics.

Harihar Thakur thundered in their dialect: ‘Ghar bar duar chod ke kahan jaibe? Tu pagla gaile ka?‘ (‘Where will you go leaving your house, land and people behind? Have you gone mad?’)

Thereafter, he went to the office where my father had submitted his application as a possible nominee for migration to Pakistan. Somehow, he managed to get my father’s nomination paper back. He then proceeded to tear it up, throwing the pieces up in the air.

That is how a Hindu secured our future in India and shielded us from embarking upon a journey of chaos, confusion and heartbreak. The way Harihar Thakur reasoned, a Muslim had the right to remain in India with as much dignity and security as a Hindu could have in a secular state.

There must be hundreds of thousands of similar anecdotes in which ordinary, God-fearing Hindus helped to reassure millions of Muslims in India at the time of partition that they had no reason to leave their homes and homeland.

Fast forward to 2016, when a Muslim in India is lynched on the mere suspicion of consuming beef or trading in livestock, when a Muslim can be thrown out of a legislature or thrashed simply for refusing to obey demands that they chant a slogan. When a Muslim man and a young boy were lynched in Jharkhand, the chief minister of the state said, “We have an Act in place … prohibiting smuggling of cattle to other states,” suggesting their murder could be linked to smuggling on their part.

I am working in Libya, thousands of miles away from India, and when I surf the Indian channels and come across such stories, my heart sinks and I recoil in fear. I wonder whether I would be ‘safe’ in my own motherland. Or could I ‘also’ end up a target of mob violence.

Muslims today are deeply apprehensive about the way vested interests are playing politics to target the community. Such events demoralise them psychologically and belittle their aspirations for a secure future. In particular, Muslims who work abroad in so many adverse situations are alarmed by these incidents and worry about what awaits them when they return home.

What is the value of money earned abroad when Muslim Indians find their own motherland questioning the integrity of her own children? Nothing is as upsetting to the heart as this mystifying experience of being Muslim in India.

India's Star Rises Higher With LIGO's Third Gravitational Wave Detection,https://m.thewire.in/article/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-blackholes-merger-astrosat,"Jun 02, 2017  |  Vasudevan Mukunth","Indian physicists verified a century-old prediction and then used ASTROSAT to firm up another. The country’s own gravitational-wave detector is expected to be ready in seven years.

Bengaluru: The first time it happened, we knew we were on the cusp of a new era. The second time it happened, the era was said to have finally begun. Now that it has happened for the third time, gravitational-wave astronomy is firmly on its way.

On June 1, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatories (LIGO) collaboration announced that on January 4, it had detected gravitational waves emanating from the merger of two blackholes. While the actual detection and logging of data is performed by the twin LIGO instruments in Louisiana and Washington, an international collaboration of more than a thousand scientists and engineers analyses them to obtain meaningful results. This includes 40 Indian scientists from 11 institutions, involved primarily in checking if the data fit expectations and in estimating the properties of the blackholes.

But in the third detection, the Indian effort was more pronounced than it has been before. It involved the ASTROSAT space telescope launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation in September 2015, as well as testing a prediction of a century-old theory. And both have further cemented the role and importance of the country’s physics community in this grand enterprise.

The blackhole merger

According to the LIGO collaboration, two blackholes weighing about 31 and 19 times as much as the Sun were rapidly orbiting each other, coming closer and closer. They eventually merged, about three billion lightyears away, emitting a gale of gravitational energy. This is “the farthest among all the LIGO detections so far,” Parameswaran Ajith, an astrophysicist at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bengaluru, and a member of the collaboration, confirmed in an interview with The Wire.

The resulting blackhole was 270 km wide and weighed about 49-times as much as the Sun, meaning almost two Suns’ worth of mass had been converted to energy and radiated away. This radiation is in the form of gravitational energy, travelling as ripples through the fabric of spacetime, away from the coalesced blackhole. On the first two occasions, reported in February and November 2016, LIGO detected waves worth three solar masses and one solar mass of energy, respectively.

The waves’ effect on our reality is deceptively simple. They compress and stretch space by very small amounts for very short durations as they pass by. An analogy: the distance we call one metre increases and decreases by minuscule spans as the crests and troughs of the waves pass through. The LIGO instruments use high-precision optics to make these measurements, being sensitive to changes of the order of 1-10,000th the width of a proton.

LIGO consists of two corridors, each 4 km long, joined at a vertex in the shape of an ‘L’. At the end of each corridor is a very shiny mirror. Laser pulses are shot simultaneously towards the mirrors from the vertex. They are reflected and return to reconvene at the vertex, forming an interference pattern in a detector installed just for that. In the absence of gravitational waves, the pulses’ electromagnetic waves cancel each other, yielding no pattern. But when a gravitational wave passes through, one pulse ends up travelling a longer distance than the other. Their electromagnetic waves then fall out of step and register an interference pattern when they reconvene. Scientists begin by working backward from this pattern.

Getting better data

Because there are two detectors, scientists also compare the data from both detectors to divine additional insights into the source. For example, Susan Scott, a physicist at Australian National University, Canberra, said in a statement that the data indicated “that the two black holes could be spinning in opposite directions, which provides a tantalising clue as to how the binary system may have formed.” Another scientist agreed, saying that it might be a hint that the blackholes formed in different places but were forced to pair up as their surroundings got too crowded with stars.

Last year, the LIGO collaboration decided to install a third detector in India to improve sensitivity as well as their ability to zero in on the blackholes’ locations. According to a statement issued by the LIGO-India consortium, “Scientific and engineering teams at IPR Gandhinagar, IUCAA Pune and RRCAT Indore are actively engaged in the pre-construction activities of LIGO-India.” At last check, the instrument was supposed to be installed either near Chittorgarh (Rajasthan) or Marathwada (Maharashtra).

According to Ajith, the LIGO instruments were able to tune in to the last six orbits of the blackholes before they merged, as well as ‘listen’ to the ringdown phase. This is when the coalesced blackhole settles down into a stable shape. The signal-to-noise ratio was comparable to the second event’s.

However, the second event was also “deeply buried in the noise”, as Karan Jani, a LIGO analyst, had told The Wire at the time, and required a special technique called matched-filtering to fish it out. Given that the signal-to-noise ratio was comparable, was the same technique enlisted this time as well?

No, because the mass made a difference. “This event was much more massive than the second event – it is comparable to the first event, but slightly less massive. For massive blackholes, the observed signals are short and look like a short burst,” Ajith said. “As a result, they can be detected without using matched-filtering. One can look for some short-lived excess power in the data.”

The Indian effort

Because of the tremendous energies at play when blackholes collide, these events are natural laboratories in which physicists can test parts of their theories for which no earthly workshop will ever do.

For example, one such theory is Albert Einstein’s general relativity, which first predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916. Apart from their other responsibilities, the Indian contingent of the LIGO collaboration used the blackhole merger to verify if the speed of the waves through space depended on their wavelength, a property called dispersion. They did not – proving Einstein right. According to Bala Iyer, the principal investigator of the Indian team in LIGO, this paves the way for the use of “a new class of astrophysical sources to test Einstein’s theory … in extreme conditions.”

For another, scientists were also curious about whether the release of gravitational waves would be accompanied by flashes of light. “According to our current understanding of astrophysics, these binary blackholes will not produce” them, Ajith said. “However, as astronomers, we have to keep an open eye – our current understanding could be wrong!” Subsequently, India’s first and only space telescope was among the many telescopes around the world involved in the effort.

ASTROSAT has a suite of six instruments studying high-energy events in the universe. Among them, the Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride Imager instrument is adept at X-ray and gamma radiation studies and is among the best of its kind. The scientists following up after LIGO’s tip used it to conduct an extensive search for fleeting X-ray flashes in the sky coinciding with the time and location of the merger. Nothing turned up. Then, its operators teamed up with the international GROWTH collaboration of 18 observatories to rule out the merger’s association with another event.

The takeaway was that the current understanding of astronomers was right after all – so far.

But that would not be the end of the story: there is still the matter of answers we don’t have yet, and despite being three detections down, gravitational-wave astronomy has only just begun. For example, as Scott had alluded to earlier, scientists are not sure how binary blackholes form in the first place. And we probably won’t know better until more LIGO observations – joined by the Indian LIGO in 2024 and assisted by ground- and space-based telescopes – reveal a wider assortment of possibilities.

“We are also anticipating other kinds of sources – such as mergers involving neutron stars, which are amazingly rich and complex,” Ajith elaborated. “Astronomers around the world are preparing to observe electromagnetic flashes from such events.”

“I think the big discoveries are yet to come. Who knows, something completely unexpected might show up in the skies!”"
COVID-19: Rohingya Refugees in India Are Battling Islamophobia and Starvation,https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/india-rohingya-refugees-starvation-covid-19,"May 01, 2020  |  Tapan Kumar Bose","Nearly all Rohingya refugees living in various refugee camps across the country have been left to fight the coronavirus pandemic on their own. The strict lockdown for India’s 1.3 billon people to prevent the spread of the virus has turned into a human tragedy for many, particularly the migrant workers, daily wage earners, street vendors and several others whose survival depends on their daily earnings. Most of the social protection packages announced by governments to feed and pay the working class daily wagers have no provisions for non-citizens. Even the Delhi government’s alternative livelihood assistance of Rs 5,000 for migrant workers does not include the Rohingya who are seen as ‘illegal migrants’. As a result, 18,000 Rohingya refugees living in India are facing a very uncertain future and situation of starvation.

Vilified as ‘Corona Bomb’

In recent times, Rohingya refugees have become highly visible due to the vicious campaign launched by the BJP and its Hindu right wing partners calling the Muslims “Corona Bomb”. This started after TV9 Bharatvarsh, a free to air TV news channel, began broadcasting a so-called investigative report linking the Rohingya refugees with the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at the Markaz mosque in Nizamuddin during the month of March. The report claims that several Rohingya refugees were deliberately infected with COVID-19 at the Markaz and then sent out to different parts of India to spread the infection on a large scale. Since its broadcast, video clips of this so-called investigative report have gone viral on social media, particularly on tweets with the hashtag #CoronaJihad and #biojihad. According to Time magazine, Equality Labs, a digital human rights group has said that these tweets have appeared nearly 300,000 times and have been seen by approximately 165 million people on Twitter

After the broadcast by the TV channel claiming that some Rohingya refugees had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, the Union home ministry on April 15 wrote to all states and union territories that, “Rohingya Muslims attended ijtemas and other religious congregations of Tablighi Jamaat and there is a possibility of their contracting COVID -19.” The letter directed the police chiefs of the states and union territories to track down and screen Rohingya Muslim refugees. However, the letter does not specify the period when the Rohingya Muslims had visited Nizamuddin Markaz and whether there were any Rohingya Muslim participants in the Tablighi Jamaat congregation that was held in the month of March in Markaz.

Rohingyas left out of safety-net

Unfortunately, despite an April 17 Delhi government order that all the inmates of Rohingya refugee camps should be tested, no such tests have been done till date. This behaviour of the local administration is not only ill-advised but dangerous. It reduces the effectiveness of the efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Even if a single Rohingya refugee in the Madanpur Khadar camp is infected and remains undetected due to the negligence of the local administration, there is a serious risk of large scale coronavirus outbreak. And, if that happens, the contagion will spread to several other communities living in and around that area.

While everyone is scared of being infected by the virus and are taking precautions – maintaining social distance, wearing face masks, washing hands and feet with soap – the Rohingya refugees unfortunately cannot take any of these preventive measures to protect themselves as it is impossible for people living in makeshift shanties that lean on each other with poor sanitation and virtually no access to healthcare. For them, soap is a luxury, let alone buying facemasks and sanitizer. Jaffar Ullah, who teaches young Rohingya girls and boys to operate a computer run by the Rohingya Human Rights Initiative, lives in one of the shanties in Madanpur Khadar, near Sarita Vihar in South Delhi. He finished his last bar of soap in the third week of March. On March 31, he told Al Jazeera, “Only a few families have soaps in our slum, while most of them can’t afford to buy one.” He also pointed out that while the local municipal workers sprayed disinfectants in nearby residential areas, they did not do so in the slums.

The Rohingya refugees did not fall out of the government’s healthcare and food support programmes during the lockdown period by mistake. They were deliberately overlooked as the Rohingya Muslim refugees have been identified by the Hindu majoritarian government as a ‘potential threat’ to India’s national security and marked for deportation.

The UNHCR which has the mandate for the protection of refugees, was apparently not aware of the dire situation of the Rohingya. However, after being informed by several NGOs, UNHCR’s New Delhi office has swung into action and the Indian office has organised organise various COVID-19-related awareness programmes in the slums over the past few weeks. It seems that the UNHCR has asked its NGO partners to distribute hygiene kits containing soaps. However, face masks are yet to be given.

In an email response, the UNHCR’s Delhi office has said, that the UNHCR and its partners have conducted sensitisation and mass information campaigns on COVID-19 prevention and response for refugees and asylum-seekers across India. This included health and hygienic messaging in different languages (including Rohingya language) through various media platforms. This was largely to ensure that refugees receive reliable and actionable information that could help them protect themselves from this unfolding crisis. Pointing out that the UNHCR operation in India is not designed to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to a large number of refugees and asylum-seekers, the e-mail claims that UNHCR in India, through its partners, has distributed food ration and hygiene items, such as soap, directly to 3,715 Rohingya families in different parts of the country.

Laudable as these efforts of the UNHCR are, it is important to remember that in the densely packed refugee camps in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Telangana and elsewhere, the options for social distancing or self-isolation are remote, with many refugees living in cramped conditions in makeshift shelters. Even simple hygiene practices such as regular handwashing become complicated feats of logistical planning when access to clean water is severely limited. The most urgent need for the Rohingya is access to food. The UNHCR needs to reassess its policy and focus on humanitarian aid urgently.

Situation in different refugee camps

In India, Rohingyas fear the religious polarisation and campaign of hate that is likely to emerge if they catch the disease. There are 250 Rohingya families living in a camp in Nuh in Haryana, which is about 100 km from Delhi. The good news, so far is that the district administration of Nuh has not found any infected person in the camp, but the adjoining areas have reported 48 cases. The bad news is that since the district of Nuh is under severe lockdown after it was declared as a COVID-19 red zone, voluntary groups have not been able to deliver food and essentials.

The simple fact is that the community at present is facing starvation as they are unable to go out and work to earn a living. With no work and no savings, they are left dependent on NGOs and benevolent locals who extend charity to them in these times of need.

Nearly 1,500 Rohingya families living in Jammu, who rely on walnut factories for work, are also running short on grains. Abdul Rahim who is a ‘community head worker’ for Save the Children, a partner of UNHCR in India, told the Anadolu Agency that malnourishment of children was already a severe problem in his community. The camp houses over 7,600 people. Because of the lockdown, they are unable to get proper food. This is taking the worst toll on women and children. Although nearby areas in Jammu have so far reported 20 cases, none are from the refugee camp in Jammu till date. Refugees say that it is a matter of days before they will have to sleep with empty stomachs. As Hafiz Mubashar, a Rohingya refugee living in Jammu told Al Jazeera, “We are struggling with both hunger and coronavirus at the same time, but I think hunger will kill us before the virus does.”

Rohingyas mobilising relief

The young volunteers of the Rohingya Human Rights Initiative belonging to the refugee community are trying their best cater to their needs in the time of the pandemic induced lockdown across the country. They have put together a kit containing five kilograms of rice and flour, one litre oil, a kilo of sugar and dal and few basic spices for one family. This group has been able to distribute about 468 such kits to Rohingya refugee families as well about 30 families of migrant workers who live in the same camp with the Rohingyas in Jammu, Delhi, Haryana and Hyderabad.

In Delhi’s Khajuri Khas, the New Trade Union Initiative has come forward with funds for food and rations. In Punjab’s Dera Bassi, about 80 families of Rohingya refugees who worked in the local in abattoirs, which are now shut, are being looked after by a local peasant’s organisation. The Salamah Trust of Hyderabad, Delhi based NGO DAJI and several individuals from across the country have contributed generously to the Rohingya Human Rights Initiative. In addition, rations have been distributed in some camps by the UNHCR and its partner NGOs.

However, considering the manner in which the pandemic has been given a communal colour in the country, often led by senior members of the ruling BJP, Rohingya Muslims could be the next potential target. A TV channel and several social media messaging portals have already labelled the Rohingyas as the ‘Corona Bomb’. In the midst of rising Islamophobia, the campsites of the refugees deserve extra protection and care. There is an urgent need to test the Rohingya on a war footing.

Chinese Warships Enter East Indian Ocean Amid Maldives Tensions,https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/chinese-warships-east-indian-ocean-maldives,"Feb 20, 2018  |  Reuters","A fleet of destroyers, at least one frigate, a 30,000-tone amphibious transport dock and three support tankers entered the Indian Ocean, a Chinese news portal said.

Shanghai: Eleven Chinese warships sailed into the East Indian Ocean this month, a Chinese news portal said, amid a constitutional crisis in the tiny tropical island chain of the Maldives now under a state of emergency.

A fleet of destroyers, at least one frigate, a 30,000-tone amphibious transport dock and three support tankers entered the Indian Ocean, news portal Sina.com.cn said, without linking the deployment to the crisis in the Maldives or giving a reason.

“If you look at warships and other equipment, the gap between the Indian and Chinese navy is not large,” Sina.com.cn said on Sunday.

It did not say when the fleet was deployed or for how long.

Rivalry between old foes India and China for influence in the Maldives became evident after President Abdulla Yameen signed up to Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative to build trade and transport links across Asia and beyond.

India, which has had longstanding political and security ties to the islands about 400 km (250 miles) away, has sought to push back against China’s expanding presence in the overwhelmingly Muslim country of 400,000 people. Maldivian opposition leaders have urged New Delhi to intervene in the crisis.

China’s Ministry of Defence did not respond to requests for comment.

On Friday, the People’s Liberation Army posted photos and a story on rescue training exercises taking place in the East Indian Ocean on its official Twitter-like Weibo account.

China earlier this month advised Chinese citizens to avoid visiting the Maldives, famous for its luxury hotels, scuba-diving resorts and limpid tropical seas, until political tensions subside.

China has been striking deals with countries in Asia and Africa in line with its Belt and Road initiative to improve imports of key commodities, upgrade infrastructure and trade routes in the region and boost its diplomatic clout.

Yameen imposed the emergency on February 5 for 15 days to annul a Supreme Court ruling that quashed convictions against nine opposition leaders and ordered his government to free those held in prison. He sought parliamentary approval to extend the emergency for 30 days on Monday.

China has drawn criticism in the West for its perceived military buildup of the neighbouring South China Sea, where it has built and expanded islands and reefs.

China claims most of the sea where neighbours Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims."
Looking Back at a Hundred Years of Research in Indian Economics,https://m.thewire.in/article/uncategorised/hundred-years-of-research-indian-economics,"Feb 24, 2017  |  J. Krishnamurthy","The Indian Journal of Economics, which was founded in 1916, well before independence, played a crucial role in highlighting the achievements of Indian economists.

The contributions of present-day home-grown Indian economists are not adequately appreciated by the establishment today. It is important to stress that India has a long tradition of work on Indian economics. I believe there were not many countries at India’s level of development in the period before independence that had such a thriving community of economists. They made original and pioneering contributions to environmental economics, macroeconomics, planning and employment analysis and many other fields.

Unfortunately, these contributions remain either unknown or are forgotten. Not many know, for instance, that the Indian Journal of Economics (IJE), founded in 1916, recently completed a hundred years of its existence. For a technical journal to continue to exist after a hundred years is a truly spectacular event.

The IJE was founded in Allahabad University by the first professor of economics at that university, Herbert Stanley Jevons, son of the famous economist, William Stanley Jevons. Herbert, the son, was the editor from 1916 to 1922, before he moved to the University of Rangoon.

The journal underwent several vicissitudes over the 1920s and 1930s, but established itself as the premier journal of economics in India. However, by the 1950s, it had lost this status, as several rivals entered the scene, including the Indian Economic Journal, the Indian Economic Review and the Economic Weekly. Apart from this, some journals devoted to business and commerce also emerged.

An important reason for the pre-eminence of the IJE was that from the early 1920s to around 1950, it was not only the journal of the University of Allahabad, but also the journal of the Indian Economic Association which had been formed in 1917. In its early years, the IJE was the forum where many of the important works of Indian economists appeared. Several of these were remarkably original for their time and some led to strong critiques and rebuttals in the pages of the IJE.

The IJE published a wide variety of articles. Some were distinctly original, while others were not. While there were several expatriate contributors to the early issues, over time more and more of the articles were by Indian economists, working in the Indian universities and colleges and in government. A number of the papers that appeared in the IJE had been read at the annual conferences of the Indian Economic Association where there had been lively debates on them.

Several of these and other contributions have been discussed at length in my book, Towards Development Economics: Indian Contributions, 1900-1945, and in my paper entitled, ‘The Indian Journal of Economics: Looking Back at the Early Years’ published in the special centennial issue of the IJE (Vol. XCVI, No. 383, April, 2016, pp.621-635.)

The IJE was not the sole outlet for original work on Indian economics. Many original contributions appeared in the form of books; a few in other journals, and at least one remained unpublished until after independence. I would cite just a couple of examples. B.R. Ambedkar published a highly original paper on industrialisation as the solution to surplus labour and the Indian agrarian problem. This appeared in the short-lived Journal of the Indian Economic Society in 1918. Around 1949, A.K. Dasgupta in his lectures at Lucknow University anticipated the work of Arthur Lewis on surplus labour and transfer of labour from agriculture to non-agriculture. This, however, appeared in published form many years later in the Economic Weekly in 1954. (For an extended discussion, see my ‘Indian Antecedents of Disguised Unemployment and Surplus Labour’, Indian Journal of Labour Economics, Vol 51, No. 1, 2008.)

Among the important papers published in the IJE before independence, I would single out four papers, all of which are reproduced in my book. I am confident others would come up with other lists.

In 1934, Radhakamal Mukherjee published a highly original paper on the ‘Broken Balance of Population, Land and Water’ dealing with the ecological problems of the Gangetic valley. This was long before environment economics became part of professional and popular discourse.

In 1935, Gyanchand in his paper ‘The Essentials of Economic Planning for India’, questioned the then current euphoria over economic planning. He pointed to the futility of achieving redistribution with growth in a colonial setting. This paper was a precursor to the debates after independence on the relevance of trickle-down economics and whether growth by itself would lead to better redistribution.

Again, in 1935, P.J. Thomas in his paper, ‘A Plan for Economic Recovery’, used the employment multiplier of R.F. Kahn to plead for public works in the context of the 1930s depression in India. He estimated that four men newly employed in public works would lead to three or four more secondarily employed. Unfortunately, the government in India was tied to conservative finance and did not give up its belief in balanced budgets.

What was perhaps the most original paper published in the IJE in 1938. This was V.K.R.V. Rao’s paper, ‘The Problem of Unemployment in India.’ It was the earliest attempt to apply Joan Robinson’s concept of disguised unemployment to a less developed country.

There were several important issues on which sharp differences of views were expressed in the journal by different Indian economists. Their brilliant arguments and counter-arguments leave one in no doubt that economics was live and had taken deep root in India. Several of the economists who wrote in the IJE, like B.P. Adarkar, B.R. Shenoy, Radhakamal Mukherjee, Jahangir Coyajee, V.G. Kale and A.K. Dasgupta, were well known in Europe and the US. Several had published books and articles in international journals. Through the IJE they work reached a much larger, Indian, audience.

Unfortunately, many of the past issues of the IJE are no longer easy to procure and read. I was fortunate enough to be able to read many of the old numbers at the Joseph Regenstein library of the University of Chicago. I cannot stress the importance of getting all past issues digitised before they disintegrate or disappear.

There is no doubt that after independence Indians have made a name for themselves in the field of economics by their original contributions in a variety of fields. However, this should not obscure the contributions of Indians to economics well before independence. We should also acknowledge the role of the IJE in the development of Indian economics over the last hundred years.

Princess Hind Al Qassimi: 'I Pray For an India Without Hate and Islamophobia',https://m.thewire.in/article/communalism/gulf-india-islamophobia-hate,"Apr 30, 2020  |  Shaikha Hind Al Qassemi","A lotus flower grew from Lord Vishnu’s navel with Brahma sitting on it. Brahma separated the flower into three parts: the Heavens, the Earth and the Sky. Out of loneliness, Brahma split himself into two to create a male and a female and from this all beings were created.

In the heart of a giant lotus flower amphitheatre I sat next to an Israeli senator, an author of a book called Tears of a Jewish Woman. I had never met knowingly a Jew, let alone a Zionist and political member of the Knesset (Israeli parliament). I was intrigued, but was calm and collected. We spoke briefly as we were both new to exploring yoga in a Bengaluru ashram (hermitage). She later invited me to visit her and I hope to meet her again.

There I was enlightened and delighted to meet people from around the world who simply came together purely for the pleasure of practising yoga. We all went vegan during our stay, which I didn’t mind because I wasn’t an avid meat-eater to start with. I just missed my cereal with milk and my prawn cocktail crisps, a guilty pleasure. The Harvard graduate doctor friend of mine had joined me and we had a delightful time exploring the sari market, bindi and tika accessories.

I still remember how people would smile whenever I would introduce myself. Everyone found it entertaining to meet an Arab princess named Hind. “Like Jai Hind?” They would ask, and I would smile in affirmation. We would rise just before dawn and head to the hall, to do our morning yoga sessions, of which there were several. It was like a pilgrimage and in it was a journey at how simple you could live. We would wear simple slippers, light cotton clothes, but I still wore my kajal, bindi and Arabic perfume. There were hundreds of people from around the world in this village that hosted an orphanage that was running on the donations of the yoga members. They had functioning buildings for IT, services and a resort with a spa.

Modern day utopia

In this melting pot, my American friend and I would meet and share our treasure of discoveries of people and their tales. There was never a moment of discrimination. A questionable resemblance to a modern day utopia. I had the pleasure of meeting the guru, along with many ambassadors and their wives who spoke about how religion didn’t matter, it was simply a rediscovered art of living in harmony.

To be able to live in union with people so different from your race, religion and region was an epiphany. I slipped into my new glass slippers like Cinderella rushing to a ball. A sense of liberation that I thoroughly recommend for everyone to try once, to simply live a day without bias or hate. It beats whatever rush adrenaline can give you, and I admit I was hooked and I am addicted to love. When your heart is open, there is no more room for hate. Anger may appear, but never take it to bed. The art of letting go, is truly the art of learning to live. Surely there are some stands worth fighting for, but being an industrial and productive person by nature, I look for solutions and hate to procrastinate and mope. I like finding answers. Fury and deep-seated prejudice is like an anchor on a sinking ship.

I am working on my PhD, which is all about Sustainability in Developing Nations, and it’s all about countries that have taken that journey of truth in recognising where their strengths lie, capitalise on it, treat and correct their weakness, recognise the opportunities and neutralise their threats. India was one of these nations, which rose from a poor farming colony to a super power today. Singapore, South Korea, Germany and Japan are in the list as well. My beloved home country as well, the UAE, that was once a handful of pearling villages that used the new-found oil wealth to educate, build and create a happy prosperous nation that hosts 3.3 million Indians that send back to their families in India $17 billion (Dh62.52 billion) a year.

Elevated rate of religious tolerance

The above-mentioned nations did not rise without guidance. Each nation had a wise leader that planted the seeds and after two generations we today reap the fruits of our labour. Some would say that an elevated rate of religious tolerance is what allowed the astronomical development as they were in these countries. Education, health, social capital, safety, security, opportunity, economy and entrepreneurship are all integral parts of the strategy of success of any one nation today.

While visiting Gandhi’s museum and reading a letter he had written to Hitler requesting him to halt the war, I bought his biography. He instilled in India the need for education, toilets, which was directly related to health and safety of their women, and demanded that they use Indian cotton and textiles instead of imports. That gave rise to entrepreneurship and boosted the economy. Hats off to having that farsightedness. The quality of governance is the final piece of the puzzle that guarantees continuity. Rome wasn’t built in a day and the result of Gandhi’s actions can only be seen a generation later. Let us not forget that Nelson Mandela was also part of the Gandhi school of thought to pursue peace. No one can deny that Gandhi was the liberator of India. Pardon me if I speak of India with so much passion, it is the land of milk and honey, and in my culture we say if you drink the milk of India she becomes your mother.

There is an unbreakable bond between Emiratis and Indians that others may not understand. We grew up with more Indians around us as children in our homes than Arabs, so a certain affinity and undeniable connection exists in our DNA. Our daily language has borrowed words and customs familiar with our own. Also Read: ‘Media and Top Central Leaders are Complicit in Communalising COVID-19’ | Ramchandra Guha

It is a shock for those of us who were familiar with India to see a rise in animosity, Islamophobia and a regular bloodbath happening, and now a pandemic that is called the ‘Qurano-Virus’. I feel that I brought back the essence of peace with me from that giant lotus hall.

World doesn’t need another Hitler

Don’t these successful so-called powerful millionaires know that hate speech is the prelude to genocide? Nazism wasn’t born in a day. It was allowed to grow like a weed that went wild because people chose to look the other side and it thrived on that specific weakness called silence. Hate is being preached openly in India against Muslims, in a nation of 182 million Muslims. BJP [India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party] and RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] leader Rajeshwar Singh, have, in an example of intimidation and hate speech, said that “Muslims and Christians will be wiped out of India by December 31, 2021”.

The world doesn’t need another Hitler, but it needs another hero like Martin Luther, Nelson Mandela, or Gandhi. Killing your brethren doesn’t make you a hero, it makes you a dictator and murderer. A snowballing movement has been started, which has reverberated across the Arab world. People have taken note and with the start of Ramadan the Muslim hearts are deep in prayer and will not allow the sparks to burn a country down. The hate must stop now as it is simply not welcome.

In the UAE, it is illegal to preach hate. People may find it funny that such a law exists, but at a rebellious time, it maintains the peace in the land. Why burn a country when you can build it? I am sure this law will allow any leader that has seen the prosperity it yields to implement it in his country.

Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, “the world is one family”, in one of the most important moral values in the Indian society. This verse from Maha Upanishad is engraved in the entrance hall of the parliament of India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi quoted it, Gandhi implemented it. I pray for peace in India, especially during this pandemic that needs to educate the masses to remain isolated to limit the spread of the shadow of death and crippling of the economic and society."
The 'Cutesy' Indian Fabric That Changed History,https://m.thewire.in/article/culture/the-cutesy-indian-fabric-that-changed-history,"Apr 30, 2020  |  Joobin Bekhrad","In a letter to her sister penned in 1851, the novelist George Eliot gave her opinion on some muslin fabrics. “The quality of the spotted one is best,” she said, “but the effect is chintzy”.

Eliot, to whom the first use of the term ‘chintzy’ is attributed, was most likely slighting not bona fide chintz but rather an inferior copy of it. The real thing was vivid and luxuriant. Its production is something that “modern science still cannot explain,” says Sarah Fee, the curator of a future exhibition about chintz at the Royal Ontario Museum. “By that time, Britain’s factories had flooded world markets with cheap imitations of chintz, industrial imitation [which made] it widely available to the masses, disassociating any original connotation of luxury.”

Chintz — although it might today be largely associated with twee or cutesy armchairs and wallpaper — is, in its true form, a fabric that was not only once highly prized the world over, and helped revolutionise fashion and design, but also changed the course of history — in many cases, unfortunately, for the worse. “[Chintz tells] a story that is much larger, and often much less pleasant”, according to Harvard historian Dr Sven Beckert. “A tale of armed trade, colonialism, slavery, and the dispossession of native peoples.”

A coverlet of typical English chintz – the floral fabric in fact originated in India

The story Beckert is referring to begins, for the most part, in the late 15th Century; but the history of chintz extends far beyond that. Chintz — which comes from the Hindi word chint, meaning “‘spotted’, ‘variegated’, ‘speckled’, or ‘sprayed’”, as Fee writes in the book Cloth That Changed the World — originated in modern-day India and Pakistan thousands of years ago. Contrary to what many think, chintz does not necessarily have anything to do with glazed fabric, or even floral prints. Simply put, chintz is cotton to which substances called ‘mordants’ and ‘resists’ — used to help dyes adhere to it — have been applied.

Over time, the word ‘chintz’ came to be used to refer to a variety of fabrics. “The term was appropriated in [the] English-speaking world in the 18th Century to reference industrially printed cottons,” says Fee. “In popular imagination, over the 19th Century, the term became associated with floral designs and heavy glazing”. As Alexandra Palmer, another curator at the ROM, explains, “More costly Indian chintz had a glazed finish… which added a stiff, luxurious hand”. Whether glazed or not, the use of mordants, resists, and dyes originally defined chintz, the intricate patterns of which were painstakingly produced by hand in two main ways: either with wooden blocks or through the more complex process of kalamkari (from the Persian “ghalamkari”, meaning “pen-work”).

Richard Quinn – worn here by Billy Porter at London Fashion Week, February 2020 – is among the current designers who favour chintz

India has been producing and exporting chintz for millennia, but it wasn’t until the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama successfully reached Calicut in India in 1498 that Indian chintz really started to create a stir around the globe. Unlike Christopher Columbus, who several years earlier had tried in vain to find India, as Beckert puts it: “[da Gama] returned to Portugal not just with highly desired spices, but also some of India’s fabulous cottons. This was the beginning of a trade that was often violent… and that climaxed a hundred years later with the establishment of various European East India Companies”.

Flowering trees are depicted in this early textile, created in western India for the Egyptian market in the late 13th or early 14th Century

After da Gama returned to Portugal, European traders began exporting textiles to markets in the Indian Ocean region. They were quick to find out, however, that their wools and linens weren’t appreciated there, and so they turned to Indian chintz instead. At first, they traded in Indian chintz in markets in the same region, but they later set their sights on Europe itself, realising the profits they could make at home.

While they were at first dependent on Arab and Turkish merchants for much of their trade in textiles, they later, as Beckert states, “[grew] tired of … [these] middlemen” and discovered sea-routes that afforded them direct access to and from India. Their efforts more than paid off, for the chintzes they started bringing back with them in the 1500s resulted in the ‘calico craze’, which peaked in the late 17th Century.

Before it appeared in fashion, chintz was big in interior design. Indian chintzes in Europe, Fee says, “were coveted as elite home furnishings, particularly to beautify small antechambers and bedrooms with colourful carpets, wallcoverings, and bedcovers”. In 1663, for example, Samuel Pepys bought chintz wallpaper for his wife’s study. According to Dr Rosemary Crill, a senior curator at the V&A Museum, chintz was used in such settings as it “was mainly seen as a feminine, informal fabric”.

A palampore (wall or bed hanging) made in southeast India for the western market, around 1720-1740

Until 1625, the chintzes brought to Europe largely featured exotic designs. Most prominent amongst the images featured in these was the Iranian and Chinese-inspired ‘flowering tree’, which, writes Crill “has come to epitomise India’s textile trade with Europe”.

The chintzes made for consumption in India and nearby featured coloured backgrounds, but the ones sent to Europe mostly had white ones, as Chinese porcelain was popular at the time. Crill writes that white also “reflected new sociocultural attitudes about health, cleanliness, and purity: all clear signifiers of luxury”.

‘Purposefully exotic’

Things changed in the middle of the 17th Century, when chintz began to be used to make clothes. While there was still demand for Indian designs, from 1625 onwards, European traders began sending Indian artisans instructions to make ones more in line with European aesthetics. The way in which chintz was adopted as a dress fabric, however, differed across the continent. In France, it was first sought after by the aristocracy; but in England and Spain, the elites only began wearing chintz “from the 1670s [onwards],” says Fee, “decades after working women had already adopted the fabric. Working women [in these countries] would use cast-offs [of furnishing fabrics] for clothing”. As it was worn by all classes and both women and men throughout Europe — “there were rules against the masses wearing silk, but not cotton”, she notes — Indian chintz “is recognised as the first mass fashion”.

These men’s banyans made of Indian chintz are glazed brown, and were created around 1765

While European importers of chintz were profiting immensely from the calico craze, local European textile merchants were far from happy. “Long-established silk, linen, hemp, and wool manufacturers,” Fee writes, “rose up in protest and even rioted against ‘the tawdry, bespotted’ cottons made by ‘Heathens and Pagans’”. Accordingly, in order to protect domestic businesses, chintz was fully banned in France between 1686 and 1759, and partially banned in Britain between 1700 and 1774. There were also various edicts issued in Spain, Venice, Prussia, and the Ottoman Empire pertaining to the import and use of chintz and other Asian textiles. However, despite traders facing even the threat of execution, they continued to smuggle chintz into Europe, and it was still extensively worn.

In the 1700s, a European manufacturer began to imitate chintz at home, sparking a series of technological innovations. This resulted in the emergence of Britain as Europe’s main printer of textiles. At the same time, though, Britain had to remain largely dependent on Indian manufacturers for its supply of cotton base cloth.

As with the Arab and Turkish middlemen, British traders did not want anyone else taking away from their profits. Unfortunately, their solution to this problem was to lead to devastating consequences. The US developed varieties of cotton that could withstand frost and were well suited to machinery. There was a double tragedy enacted: slavery and the removal of indigneous Americans. To cultivate this cotton, British (and other European) planters used slaves from West Africa, whom they obtained in exchange for European and Indian cottons. Fee writes that this was concomitant with “the tragic state-sponsored removal of indigenous American populations”.

Through such unethical means, these British traders brought about a “burst of technological innovations from circa 1770 to 1830… leading to the first massive factories and mill towns” in Fee’s words – or, as Beckert writes in his book Empire of Cotton, “the launching pad for the broader Industrial Revolution”.

Following the US Declaration of Independence in 1776, chintz’s fortunes in the West started to wane. For one, Britain had lost the US as a market for its machine-manufactured chintz. Also, minimalist ideals in 19th-Century European fashion meant that the multicoloured fabric had more or less gone out of style. In addition, Britain’s Arts and Crafts movement of the mid-1800s was influential in rejecting “industrial production and [promoting] instead handcrafts and Eastern designs, including those of India”, according to Fee. In interior design, however, as well in chinaware, chintz was still in demand, both in Britain and amongst British ex-pats in colonial India, and there was actually a growing desire for chintz clothing in countries like Iran, one of India’s major markets.

Created in coastal southeast India in around 1740-50, this highly detailed textile is typical of the era

Although chintz largely fell out of style in Western fashion in the 19th Century, it has made various comebacks since then, most notably in the hippiedom of the 1960s, when Marc Bolan sang about a man “upon the seas of Abyssinia… [whose] robes of chintz were melting in the snows”. In the 1980s, it was used extensively and again popularised by interior decorators like the late Mario Buatta (‘The Prince of Chintz’) and home furnishing brands like Laura Ashley; but Ikea put an end to this resurgence with its influential 1996 ‘Chuck Out Your Chintz’ ad campaign.

Thanks to George Eliot’s coinage of the term ‘chintzy’ in reference to the cheap British imitations of real chintz, as well as its use as a catch-all term for gaudy floral designs, it has come to evoke images of “your grandmother’s curtains”, among other such “dowdy” things, to quote Fee. There are those, however, who would beg to differ. In India, for instance, chintz and other indigenous textiles are being used by contemporary designers like Sufiyan Khatri and Rajesh Pratap Singh, according to senior V&A curator Divia Patel. Likewise, Eiluned Edwards of Nottingham Trent University says that varieties of Indian chintz like ajrakh “[are] seen on the catwalk at India Fashion Week, as well as on the rails of retailers… in the malls of metropolitan India”.

Intricate small-scale floral patterns are used in this 18th-Century textile

Not that the fabric is only appreciated in its place of origin today. Since the 2010s, chintz (in the Western sense of the term) has been used by designers such as Alexander McQueen’s Sarah Burton, Richard Quinn, Erdem Moralıoğlu, and Mulberry’s Johnny Coca. And designers like Cath Kidston and Betsey Johnson have used and been inspired by chintz for decades. “I have always been fascinated by chintz,” says Kidston, whose new book A Place Called Home more than bears its mark. “It’s the ultimate fabric in terms of printing and drawing and so versatile.” Similarly, Johnson tells BBC Designed that “chintz patterns and the whole look of chintz have been my mainstay in all my work over the last 35 years. I’ve always loved the feeling of being in a garden that chintz gives you. It’s beautiful and floral, like Scarlett O’Hara and Southern belles.”

In the 2010s, numerous publications wrote about the chintz comeback, including Vogue, which in 2018 called it “the print that’s back in a big way”. This remains to be seen; but, if history is any guide, it can be said that chintz won’t, at least, go the way of powdered wigs in fashion. “It will always come in and out of home decor and fashion,” says Betsey Johnson, “because it’s so damn good”.

"India Presents Draft Protocol On Customs, Roads At Chabahar Project Trilateral Meeting",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-iran-afghanistan-draft-protocol-chabahar-project-trilateral-meeting,"Oct 24, 2018  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: Even as the US has still not given a clear sign of a waiver, India, along with Iran and Afghanistan, have triggered the relevant clauses of the 2016 Chabahar agreement to a follow-up committee to finalise the draft protocol required harmonise standards and customs to “fully operationalise” the strategic Iranian port.

This was decided at the first trilateral meeting of the Coordination Council of the Chabahar agreement that took place in Tehran on Tuesday, October 23.

According to a press release from the ministry of external affairs, “detailed discussions were held between the three sides on full operationalisation of the trilateral Agreement for international transit and transport through Chabahar Port”.

“All sides shared the view that full operationalisation of trilateral Chabahar initiative will promote connectivity and economic development of Afghanistan and the region,” it added.

The commitment to “full operationalisation” was given by the three countries in the background of the looming deadline of renewed US sanctions against Iran.

Last month, senior State department official had said that they understood the importance of Chabahar in India’s strategic calculations in the region.

“We very much appreciate what India has done to provide both assistance to Afghanistan, including through using Chabahar Port for the delivery of wheat. We also very much appreciate what India has done to allow Afghanistan to diversify its trade relationships, and again Chabahar has played a role there. So those factors will certainly be taken under consideration,” principal deputy assistant secretary for the bureau of South and Central Asia region Alice Wells told PTI in September.

However, there has still not been any clear green signal from US that there will be a ‘carve-out’ for Chabahar from the sanction regime.

For India, Chabahar is not just a conduit to Afghanistan, but also to the central Asia region and beyond.

The MEA press release noted that Indian delegation, led by MEA’s Secretary (Economic Relations) T.S. Tirumurti, presented a draft protocol for harmonising soft infrastructure that will make the “route attractive, decrease logistic costs and pave the way for smooth implementation of the Trilateral Chabahar Agreement”.

The follow-up committee would hold its meeting before the end of this year to “discuss and aim to finalise” the protocol to harmonise transit, roads, customs and consular matters. This is as per article 10 of the 2016 Chabahar agreement, which states that the follow-up committee should be at the level of director general or joint secretary.

Iranian news agency, Tasnim News reported that the Iranian side “put forward some suggestions to his Indian and Afghan counterparts, including ways to tap the potential of various transit corridors of the region, especially the north-south corridor, and facilitate and accelerate easy and safe access to the transit routes”.

The next meeting of the Coordination Council will be held in the first half of 2019 in India."
How Economics Is Forging Renewed Links With Social Sciences,https://m.thewire.in/article/education/economics-forging-links-social-sciences,"Oct 04, 2017  |  Arjun Jayadev, Rajiv Sethi, Wendy Carlin and Samuel Bowles","When ‘political economy’ became just ‘economics,’ the shift came at the cost of its links to other social sciences.

Economics began its life as ‘political economy,’ and the 18th and 19th-century classical economists grappled with questions that are fundamental throughout the social sciences. Adam Smith was the author of The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments. David Ricardo, in the preface to his path-breaking Principles, identified the distribution of the total produce of a country among the different classes – in the form of rents, profits and wages – to be the “principal problem in Political Economy.” And Thomas Malthus’s essay on population is known to have influenced Darwin.

Over time, economics narrowed its focus, allowing it to explore a tightly circumscribed set of questions with great depth and mathematical rigour. Political economy became just economics. But this came at the cost of broken links with other social sciences or attempting to impose on them its own methodology. Economics became a science of resource allocation, with issues such as distributional conflict, institutional change and historical development receding into the background. And it began to operate within a mathematical framework with claims of universal applicability, as relevant in economies from Bengaluru to Boston.

The limitations of this approach began to be apparent more than a generation ago. Since then, we have seen a flowering of research in experimental and behavioural economics and network theory, as well as renewed interest in history, institutions and politics. This has started to broaden not only the questions but also the methods and models that we use.

But this re-engagement of economics with the world did not make it into the undergraduate curriculum, where from Santiago, Chile, to Manchester, UK, student revolts demanded more relevant teaching. These twin pressures produced the Curriculum Open-Access Resources in Economics (CORE) project.

CORE project

The CORE project began when a group of about 20 collaborators from around the world came together in 2013 to improve economics teaching for undergraduates. We recognised that even though the economy itself was a gripping object of study, the profession had done very poorly in conveying both what economists actually know, and also in providing any understanding of the seismic global changes and challenges being witnessed by students on a daily basis.

Changing the paradigm would be difficult, if only because of the sheer inertia associated with decades of teaching in a particular way with hundreds of hours in sunk costs of preparing serviceable if dated lecture slides and test banks. At the very outset, we realised that it would be akin to turning a supertanker around. Just as challenging, we were committed to developing these materials to providing them at zero cost to students, following an old but correct economics principle: knowledge is a global public good and once created making it available to additional students is free. In economics language: its marginal cost is zero and so too should be its price.

With some initial funding from the Institute for New Economic Thinking as well as from academic institutions such as Sciences Po in Paris and Azim Premji University in Bengaluru, we produced a beta version of what was to become our textbook ‘The Economy.’ We then began to experiment with it at different universities across the world, as an alternative to the standard microeconomics and macroeconomics introductory sequence.

The reception was more successful than we could ever have imagined. Our curriculum has been adopted for introductory courses at some top European universities, including University College London, the Toulouse School of Economics and Sciences Po, as well as some leading undergraduate institutions in the US, such as Barnard College and Middlebury College. In India, it has been used at Azim Premji University for the past two years, and instructors at other institutions such as Ashoka University are currently experimenting with it.

Reasons for the success of the conventional economics approach

Why has the old paradigm persisted so stubbornly? A mid-20th-century economist, Abba Lerner, had an explanation for the success of the conventional economics approach that has until now dominated the textbooks. According to Lerner: “An economic transaction is a solved political problem… Economics has gained the title Queen of the Social Sciences by choosing solved political problems as its domain.” He went on to explain that the conflict of interests that exists in every transaction is fully resolved in a contract that will be enforced by the courts, not by the parties to the transaction. “The solution is essentially the transformation of the conflict from a political problem to an economic transaction.”

Lerner was absolutely right: in the standard model, there is no space for the exercise of power. If a worker does not work as hard as stipulated in an agreement, then she simply would not be paid. The employer has no need to exercise any power over the employee, for example through the threat of job termination. The contract itself, being completely specified, is sufficient to guarantee the outcome desired by the firm.

This aspect of the conventional model was what motivated Paul Samuelson – who wrote the most famous of the standard textbooks – to remark: “In a perfectly competitive market, it really doesn’t matter who hires whom, so have labour hire capital.” We’re quite sure that he considered this to be a feature of the approach. But to the CORE project, it is definitely a bug.

By focusing on an idealised “perfectly” competitive model the awkward question of who has power and for whose benefit it is wielded could be deftly sidestepped. ‘The Queen of the Social Sciences’ could reign alone, ignoring the insights of:

Legal scholars who study real contracts and the challenges of enforcement,

Psychologists and sociologists who seek to understand the motivations and thought processes of real people,

Philosophers and ordinary citizens animated by concerns of economic justice and individual freedom and dignity,

Political scientists who consider the top-down structure of a firm as in part a system of power,

Historians, anthropologists and archaeologists who study the variety of institutions governing our economic lives and which have shaped our development since pre-history; and

Biologists and ecologists who see the economy as a part of the biosphere with unavoidable “external” effects on its functioning and even sustainability.

By contrast, the paradigm motivating CORE draws upon such insights from other disciplines in order to understand how prices, wages and interest rates are determined, how the aggregate economy functions and other central questions at the heart of the discipline.

But even including these insights, as critical as they are, is not going to be sufficient to achieve some of our other aims. We wish the introductory course to speak to students throughout the world, without assuming that the same universal concerns apply with equal force everywhere. Thus, for example, it is important that Indian issues such as informal markets, mass unemployment, structural change, liberalisation, caste and gender inequalities and rapid urbanisation that are central to the experience and concerns of India’s students are placed front and centre and not relegated to special topics the students who stick it out may encounter in more advanced courses.

This is why we are now in the process of working on a South Asian version of ‘The Economy.’ Having a digital and readily changeable electronic format allows us to do this, and we hope to develop an effective adaptation that not only prominently features some unique features of the Indian economy, but also provides students with a strong empirical understanding of their lived experience. Further, in order to encourage the adoption of our curriculum, we plan to run annual workshops for instructors and postgraduate students beginning next year.

Our hope is that these changes will help economics return to its original orientation to study what exists, with the best insights that are available from all disciplines. In doing so, we hope that students of the CORE course will become citizens better equipped to address the pressing problems facing India and other countries today.

"In 'Moderne' India, Social Apartheid Is Sparking Millions of Small Mutinies",https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/noida-inequality-zohra-bibi-social-apartheid,"Jul 26, 2017  |  Monobina Gupta","There is a new element, a twist, in the age-old tale of discrimination and exploitation in India – and that element is rage.

It’s one of those hot and enervating mid-July afternoons. Anjum is sitting in her class at a government school in East Delhi’s Patparganj. The class of 30 students is struggling to concentrate on the lesson at hand. Concentration doesn’t come easily when you are sitting in a makeshift tin building without electricity (though a fan and light were finally installed earlier this week). “A new school building is coming up in the complex. Till construction is complete, students will continue to huddle in the cramped classroom,” Anjum’s father, Tarun Das*, tells me. Till recently, Das was working as a driver in Delhi. Now he ferries passengers – school students, office-goers, anyone in need of a ride – in his new e-rickshaw. “I can’t drive around in this city any longer. The traffic is too chaotic,” he tells me.

Like tens of thousands of others, Das, originally from West Bengal, came to Delhi in search of a job. That was well over a decade ago. “Low-income people have found it harder to survive throughout this period,” he says. With wry humour, Das talks about how indifferently and callously the national capital treats its poor – especially workers, both migrants and non-migrants. He talks about how the benefits of subsidies never reach those they are intended for. Take, for instance, the case of the electricity tariff, which, due to the AAP-led Delhi government’s initiative, has substantively come down. But tenants like Das still have to cough up more money than they ought to – exceeding the actual bill amount – simply because landlords never show tenants the actual bill.

Despite the government’s tall talk of improved governance (not just the present government but every government of the day for years), ordinary people have not been able to get the system to respond to them. “The government could have made life so much easier for people had it done its job in the education and health sectors,” he claims. He narrates a story about his nasty encounter in an East Delhi government hospital: “A couple of nights ago, I suddenly felt extremely ill. It felt like a heart attack. We rushed to Guru Teg Bahadur hospital in Shahdara. The Emergency compounder gave me an injection. After that I lay on a stretcher the whole night. Not a single doctor attended to me. I left the hospital in the morning.”

Our conversation turns to the sordid face-off between domestic workers and residents in Noida’s Mahagun Moderne, the housing society that recently grabbed media headlines. Zohra Bibi, who worked as a domestic worker in Mahagun Moderne – a posh apartment complex in Noida – went missing on July 12. There were conflicting media reports about how and where Zohra was later found, even as a group of her friends and neighbours stormed the apartment complex. In photographs splashed across newspapers the next day, Zohra Bibi appeared near unconscious. According to a report in Scroll.in, “Though both sides traded charges and police cases were filed against the workers as well as the residents, only the group of workers who stormed the society were detained. Of these, 13 were charged with attempted murder even though none of the FIRs filed over the incident mentioned a physical attack on residents. About 81 workers were ‘blacklisted’ and barred from entering the society for protesting on July 12.” What’s more, the Noida Authority razed more than three dozen shanties in the area where the protesters lived.

These narratives focus on three different arenas of social life – education, health and domestic work; each distinct from the other on some level. Yet, these narratives also share the common elements of disaffection and rage stemming from the reality of social and economic inequality. If Das’s daughter sweats it out in a tin building, her father lies unattended to in a government hospital the whole night. In a different part of the National Capital Region, friends and neighbours of a domestic worker, furious over the treatment meted out to her, express their rage by throwing stones at an apartment complex, rattling its secured gates. Then, some of their own homes are demolished by a vindictive administration. Das, too, is bitter about how heavily tilted the system is in favour of the rich or the better-off. But he has more at stake than Zohra Bibi and therefore exercises restraint.

One could say that these stories are as old as the republic of India itself. Why then go on chronicling the same narratives of despair? One reason perhaps has to do with systemic flaws that, far from being dealt with and removed, continue to work – perhaps with even more efficiency than before – against the underclasses. Ironically, the inequality graph has moved upward even as India has become more integrated with the global economy, even as new opportunities have opened up. Since the onset of economic liberalisation in 1991, class stratification has deepened, as has the indifference towards the underprivileged along axes of class, caste and other such determinants. In many ways, Delhi is the prime site where you encounter some of the glaring manifestations of such systemic social apartheid. The rich and the poor exist side by side – often separated just by a street. But territorial proximity is offset by economic and social distance.

The underpaid and the badly exploited Zohra Bibis, without whose services most middle-class households would grind to a halt, sit on the ground, eat food from plates separately kept for them and are not allowed to use toilets in the houses they sweep and clean. The signs of class apartheid are simply too many to compile a holistic list. One particularly embarrassing sight many of us are likely to have been confronted with on more than one occasion is that of young working class girls in restaurants standing by or sitting awkwardly in silence as a chattering middle class family tucks into a meal and she minds their brattish child. Class apartheid is undoubtedly not peculiar to India. Yet there does seem to be a certain uniqueness to the audacity with which the privileged leverage their status to both degrade the poor and mark out a space for themselves.

All this has led to a singular attrition of the dignity of labour in Indian society – although there was never much dignity to begin with. In his book Capital: A Portrait of Twenty-First Century Delhi, Rana Dasgupta writes about an array of Delhi’s underclasses – domestic workers, cooks, gardeners – all of whom are essential to their well-heeled employers leading comfortable lives. Reviewing his book in New Republic, historian Ramachandra Guha writes: “Reading Dasgupta on Delhi’s urban underclass recalled for me what Eduardo Galeano once wrote of their Latin American counterparts, who likewise ‘sell newspapers they cannot read, sew clothes they cannot wear, polish cars they will never own and construct buildings where they will never live.'”

But there is a new element, a twist, in this age-old tale of discrimination and exploitation. And that element is rage. The stone-throwing and gate-rattling at Mahagun Moderne is just one of the many public and spontaneous expressions of anger which we have been witness to in the recent past.

The Danger of a Bigger Black Economy Based on Invalid Currency is Emerging,https://m.thewire.in/article/banking/black-money-new-economy-demonetisation,"Nov 14, 2016  |  Gulshan Sachdeva","If people continue to exchange in old currency notes with the faith that it will be accepted at least within the black economy, it may become a permanent feature of Indian monetary system.

Knowingly or unknowingly the Modi government has pushed the country into something resembling the Soviet era. The whole country is queuing up for hours in front of banks or ATMs in search of few thousand rupees. The unpreparedness of the whole demonetisation scheme has exposed the gross inefficiencies of the Indian banking system. With $217 billion (86% of total currency value in circulation) currency out of the system, markets are deserted and economic activities are at a bare minimum. If the present chaos continues for some more time, there is a danger of a parallel black economy emerging based on banned currency. This could be a much serious phenomenon than existing black economy.

Most people waited patiently for two-three days for things to settle down. Now it seems it is going to be much longer than just a quick transformation to a new system based on new currency notes. Finance minister Arun Jaitley has admitted that it will take at least couple of weeks for the system to become normal. After waiting for new currency notes for a few days, many small businesses have already started accepting old currency notes of 500 and 1000. This trend may increase in the coming days. At the moment this is based on the hope that these old notes will be deposited in savings accounts which has acceptable limit of Rs 2,50,000. Apart from their current accounts, most small businesses will also have a few savings accounts per family member. So transactions up to couple of days of business and trade could be accommodated. Instead of closing their shops for the next few weeks, these are desperate measures adopted by some small shopkeepers. In the absence of valid currency, these informal measures are providing a cushion to small traders and ordinary people who have limited or no access to electronic money transfers.

However, if the present situation continues for a longer time, the non-legal tenders may also find some permanent acceptability (perhaps at a permanently lower value) within the black economy. Two major functions of money include medium of exchange and store of value. If people continue to exchange in old currency notes with the faith that it will be accepted at least within the black economy, it may become a permanent feature of Indian monetary system. It may be used for many transactions which are illegal any way and will never show up in the formal banking system. It is expected that at the end of the demonetisation period of March 2017, a significant amount of money may still be in the hands of people who will not be able to deposit or convert it with new currency. The chaotic situation in the next few weeks will provide an opportunity for this kind of black economy based on banned currency to emerge. So it is very important that the whole transformation to new currency notes is completed as quickly as possible.

Overall, the economic benefits of this demonetisation scheme were always questionable. This was broadly seen as a political move by the government to show that it can take bold decisions and is serious about black money. The immediate euphoria created by sudden announcement has already been wiped out. Emerging anger in the streets will benefit political opposition more than the ruling party. The only option for the government is to activate all its administrative capacities to deliver transformation as quickly as possible. Slow and chaotic transformation will harm the Indian economy seriously. Any rollback now will be very expansive for the government, politically and economically.

ICAN has shaken the NPT system but India remains uncomfortable about arms control treaties that bypass the Conference on Disarmament.

New Delhi: India may have gone from being a state that decried nuclear weapons to one that possesses them but its continued commitment to an international treaty banning their stockpiling and use has made it somewhat of an outlier among other nuclear armed states. So why then has South Block not popped the champagne (or performed the sanskari equivalent of a celebration) in honour of the winners of the 2017 Nobel peace prize, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons? After all, ICAN has pushed the idea of a ban to the stage where a full-fledged treaty text now exists, signed by 53 countries around the world, and is scheduled to enter into force (for its signatories, at any rate) later this year.

India abstained on resolutions and boycotted talks in the run up to the treaty largely due to procedural reasons. But Indian officials acknowledge a sense of grudging admiration for the doggedness of the new breed of disarmament activists who are trying to upend the business-as-usual consensus on the part of the five official nuclear weapons states – whose indefinite possession of deadly weapons of mass destruction has been sanctified by the NPT.

While India, like other nuclear-armed states, stayed away from the treaty negotiation process, it was careful not to attack the initiative. The sense of frustration among most countries at the unwillingness of nuclear weapon states to implement their disarmament obligations was palpable, say officials. Therefore, for India, it was important to note this ground-swell.

Even as it opposed the new initiative in October 2016, therefore, New Delhi made special mention of “efforts made by some of the cosponsors to reach out to India”. “Continued dialogue and consultation is necessary to bridge the current divides on nuclear disarmament which remain deep and substantive,” India had asserted.

Among the nuclear weapon states, the Indian delegation was the only one to go up to the activists at the UN’s first committee to acknowledge their expertise. “We have our differences [with ICAN] but always had mutual respect,” a senior Indian diplomat told The Wire

In March this year, India’s permanent representative to the UN Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva, Amandeep Singh Gill formally announced India’s intention to stay away from the ban conference. At the same time, India had described the efforts behind the initiative as being “sincere”.

A month earlier, in February 2017, India had also admitted that “whatever the prospect of the proposed ban Conference, it reflects the aspirations of a large number of states and a dedicated NGO community led by a new generation of young leaders passionate about the noble cause of ridding the world of nuclear weapons”.

In July, 122 countries voted in favour of the final draft of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons – a legally binding instrument which reached fruition 10 years after the ICAN movement was launched. The treaty will come into force in December.

The Nobel committee’s official citation commends ICAN, an umbrella group of NGOs in 100 countries, for drawing “attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons”.

Though there has been no official statement from India on the winner of 2017 Nobel peace prize, a senior MEA official told The Wire that ICAN’s achievements may still be illusory but it did illustrate the new reality of policy activism.

“In a world of brutal and self-serving cynicism, the [Nobel] prize acknowledges there is still place for innocent but passionate commitment to a popular utopian goal,” he said. “It is a prize for a 21st century generation NGO that has taken the lead in breaking the back of one of the pillars of 20th century nuclear order – the NPT [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty].”

The prize is also a demonstration of the new, coordinated method of campaigning between states and civil society actors. ICAN may have created and sustained the public campaign, but it required the institutional backing from states to carry the proposal through the corridors of United Nations.

Why India stayed away

The main reason India boycotted the ICAN-sponsored treaty initiative was that it believes the CD is the only forum to negotiate the elimination of nuclear weapons.

“The CD is the right place for pursuing nuclear disarmament in all its essential elements. It has the mandate, the membership and the rules for embarking on the path to nuclear disarmament,” India had said in March.

This was reiterated by India’s permanent representative to the UN, Syed Akbaruddin in New York at the high-level plenary to commemorate and celebrate the international day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons. “India considers the Conference on Disarmament – the world’s single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum – as the appropriate forum for the commencement of negotiations on nuclear disarmament,” he said on September 26.

Of course, the CD remains deadlocked and can’t take forward its agenda on the proposed Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty and Prevention of Arms Race in Outer Space, mainly due to procedural objections by Pakistan – backed by China.

“We regret that the [CD] has been prevented from adopting a programme of work that reflects the international community’s desire for progress on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects,” Akbaruddin said.

Senior Indian diplomats told The Wire that even now India “stands ready” to commence negotiations in the CD on a comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Convention along the lines of the Chemical Weapons Convention.

India was not the only country which boycotted the two nuclear ban negotiating conferences in March and July. None of the other eight nuclear weapons nations – the US, UK, China, France, Russia, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea – participated in the talks. Overall, 69 countries kept off – most of whom included Asian and European countries who are under Washington’s nuclear umbrella.

While the instrument is a legally binding treaty, it will obviously not be applicable on those who do not sign it.

“We do not intend to sign, ratify or ever become party to it. Therefore, there will be no change in the legal obligations on our countries with respect to nuclear weapons,” the UK, US and France said in a joint statement after the UNGA adopted the new treaty on July 7.

Over a week later, India also reiterated that it cannot be party to the treaty and “so shall not be bound by any of the obligations that may arise from it”.

The external affairs ministry spokesperson also underlined the fact that “this treaty in no way constitutes or contributes to the development of any customary international law”.

Utility of the ban treaty

In line with this reality, the press release announcing the peace Nobel acknowledges that the prize has been given for an aspirational idea. “The Norwegian Nobel Committee is aware that an international legal prohibition will not in itself eliminate a single nuclear weapon, and that so far neither the states that already have nuclear weapons nor their closest allies support the nuclear weapon ban treaty”.

The proponents of the nuclear ban treaty have asserted that the nuclear ban treaty’s first job will be to “stigmatise” the possession of nuclear weapons.

A critique published in the Bulletin of American Scientists after the UNGA vote had questioned this assumption. Well known US arms control experts Scott Sagan and Benjamin Valentino had said that there “was simply no evidence to suggest that the ban’s approach to stigmatising nuclear weapons will be an effective path to disarmament”.

They pointed out that research has shown that it is easier to predict compliance if others in the peer group also observe the laws. “In the case of the ban, all nuclear weapons states know that the rate of compliance among other nuclear weapons states is zero. Such a ban, therefore, might ultimately do more to undermine the gradual and step-by-step disarmament norm rather than strengthen it,” said the authors.

Indian officials have spelled out their formula for a comprehensive nuclear weapons convention – prohibition on use, universal prohibition on possession, complete elimination and international verification. New Delhi’s reference to the CWC as a model is due to the fact that it is the only international “verifiable” pact eliminating an entire category of weapons of mass destruction.

“A treaty focused primarily on prohibition of nuclear weapons would have made eminent sense in 1945, before the military utility of nuclear weapons was demonstrated and acted upon – by one country after another, in one form or another – so much so, today, 25 years after the end of the Cold War and 71 years into the nuclear age, the security policies of countries having almost half the world´s population are linked to nuclear weapons,” said Indian ambassador to Spain D.B. Venkatesh Varma, one of the MEA’s top disarmament experts, at an international seminar on “A World Free of Nuclear Weapons” in February 2017.

Accordingly, the first step cannot be ‘stigmatisation’ as nuclear ban treaty supporters assert, but reducing the military utility of nuclear weapons by narrowing the circumstances of their use.

The second phase, as delineated by Varma, is a global treaty that would ensure nuclear weapons were retained only for deterrence. The final phase would be to conclude a legal instrument that would prohibit their use under any circumstances."

New Delhi: In a bid to boost people-to-people relations with India, Myanmar will provide visa-on-arrival for Indian tourists, President Ram Nath Kovind said on Tuesday as he began his five-day visit to the country.

President Kovind’s visit to Myanmar will continue India’s high level engagements with Myanmar under the rubric of ‘Act East Policy’ and ‘Neighbourhood First Policy’.

“Coinciding with President Kovind’s visit, and to further people-to-people relations, Myanmar has also announced a visa-on-arrival facility for Indian tourists entering the country through the international airports of Nay Pyi Taw, Yangon and Mandalay,” the president’s office tweeted.

The President said that residents of India’s Northeast region have particularly welcomed and are beginning to reap the benefits of the Land Border Crossing Agreement concluded recently.

The landmark Land Border Crossing Agreement between India and Myanmar, signed on May 11, 2018, was brought into effect in August with the simultaneous opening of international entry-exit checkpoints at the Tamu-Moreh and the Rihkhawdar-Zowkhawtar border between the two nations.

“They look forward to the early conclusion of the Motor Vehicles Agreement,” Kovind said.

Several agreements are expected to be signed during the President’s visit which comes amid China’s foray into the southeast Asian country with which it has signed a mega port deal.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Myanmar last year, while Myanmar’s State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi visited India in January for the India-ASEAN Commemorative Summit."

New York: The world‘s top sugar exporters have initiated a legal review of government supports in the EU, India and Pakistan that may violate World Trade Organization restrictions on direct subsidies, according to an industry executive.

The Global Sugar Alliance launched an investigation this year into whether the EU, India and Pakistan are in violation of WTO rules, with plans to conclude by July, the group’s secretary, Warren Males, told Reuters along the sidelines of New York “Sugar Week.” The group represents top exporting nations, including Brazil, Australia and Thailand.

Members of the Global Sugar Alliance met during the annual industry conference in New York, with plans to reconvene after finishing the review, Males said. The group will discuss next steps, with plans to ask their governments to either step up talks with counterparts in the EU, India and Pakistan or to take action with the WTO, he said.

“We had been weighing this for some time, (but) the issue became more pressing,” said Males, who is also the head of economics at Australia’s Canegrowers trade group.

Raw sugar prices traded in New York are languishing near 2015 lows as global supplies swell, outstripping production at record levels. That has the world‘s millers and refiners churning out sugar for prices below production costs."
"National Convention Highlights Role of Women's Studies, Urges UGC to Continue Financial Support",https://m.thewire.in/article/education/national-convention-highlights-role-womens-studies-centres-urges-ugc-continue-financial-support,"Aug 24, 2017  |  Amanat Khullar","The Indian Association for Women’s Studies highlighted the contributions of women’s studies centres over the last three decades and discussed how attempts to dilute them could be stopped.

New Delhi: Printed in white, bold letters, the word ‘save’ was hard to miss on the badges worn by several dozens of people inside the brightly-lit Speaker’s Hall of the Constitution Club on August 23. Under ‘save’, the words ‘women’s studies centres’.

The Indian Association for Women’s Studies (IAWS) – prompted by a notice by the University Grants Commission (UGC) – held a national convention on Wednesday to discuss the significance and contributions of these centres over the last three decades and talk about how the attempts to dilute the centres could be stopped. Over 200 faculty members, students, research scholars and representatives of women’s organisations from across the country attended the convention.

On June 16, the UGC issued a notice expressing uncertainty about continued funding for 163 women’s studies centres and schools across the country. These centres have run on plan-to-plan budgeting for decades.

“All the on-going schemes of the UGC under the Plan Head would continue up to 30.09.2017 and expenditure therein would be admitted up to 30.09.2017. Their further continuance beyond 30.09.2017 would depend on the outcome of the review by the UGC,” the notice stated.

This notice counters a previous one about the extension of financial support till March 31, 2018, and implies that funding for women’s studies centres may be withdrawn in the middle of the academic year at the end of September.

Amidst the present political climate of “somewhat regression,” growing violence against women and politicising of education, there is an ever increasing need to preserve the women’s studies centres, according to the IAWS president Ritu Dewan. “It is time we all come together, from activities to students. A threat like this will only makes us stronger.”

This, however, is not the first time that an attempt has been made to dilute the autonomy of women’s studies centres. In 2003, the NDA government – under the 10th Five Year Plan – sought to rename the centres in different universities as women and family studies centres. This change would have moved focus of the interdisciplinary courses taught at these centres away from that of gender equality and the questioning of patriarchal gender roles.

History of women’s studies

In 1986, women’s studies was introduced into the National Policy of Education, and as part of the 12th Five Year Plan, women’s centres saw an expansion in India at a time when they were declining globally.

Since then, the students and scholars at these centres have made significant contributions towards eliminating violence against women, highlighting the role of women in various fields and have even managed to penetrate the macro economy. According to Devika Jain, a founding member of IAWS, feminist economists have managed to get their ideas into reading lists, which policymakers have been able to access. “Women’s studies centres have been able to put feminist footprints on the blackboard of macro economic policies,” she said, as part of a panel discussion at the convention. “We researched and that was fed into policy.”

The government turns towards such centres when they seek a gender dimension to the economic policy and the students and scholars, in turn, provide an “endless supply line” to the government.

“The government should encourage dialogue between women’s studies centres and ICMR, ICAR, NITI Aayog etc. for enabling growth in the Indian economy,” Jain added.

Women’s studies, since becoming part of the mainstream, have reflected women’s struggles. According to Maithreyi Krishnaraj, the former director of RCWS, women’s studies have made their mark in exposing comfortable myths about the Indian and Hindu society. “It has exposed black spots and countered ideas of colonial regime, and tries to uncover the selective evidence that is often present.”

Field research done by these centres shed light on the fact that households in India were not a unit, but instead consists of men and women making individual contributions. Research even shed light on the role of women in agriculture and exposed the role of women in various mass movements. “Feminism is not an export,” added Krishnaraj. “It’s an indigenous experience as various studies have shown.”

Role of women’s studies centres

Big movements prompted by episodes in history like the Shah Bano case, Mathura rape case and the Roop Kanwar case further enabled “us to bate into lawmaking as well,” said Malini Bhattacharya, former director of SWS, Jadavpur University. The energy of these movements prompted uncomfortable questions about what was being done in terms of law and policy, debates were being held throughout the country and women’s studies filled that gap. “Women’s studies were energised by these movements. Women’s studies combined activism with studies, and they further interacted with the government.”

The 1974 ‘Towards Equality’ report by the Committee on the Status of Women lay the foundation of women’s movement in India, and uncovered discriminatory socio-cultural practices, political and economic processes. The report assumed the gender lens to talk about democracy and development, highlighting issues of declining sex ratio and condition of girl’s education.

Bhattacharya said that even though government funding was erratic even when the women’s centre began at the Jadavpur in 1989, “state universities were less cash strapped than they have become today.”

“Today, women’s movements need women’s studies just as much as women’s studies need women’s movements.”

At a time when the triple talaq judgement is being hailed by people across the country, there is a need to probe into the inequalities inherent in all personal laws and understand its nuances, according to Bhattacharya. For that, we need data and analysis. “That is where women’s studies comes in.”

Indu Agnihotri, the director of Centre for Women’s Development Studies, agreed. “Women’s studies centres have contributed to academic perspectives in India. The gender lens has enriched all disciplines in India, and contributed critical perspectives while breaking conventional academic boundaries.”

Despite their significant contributions, there is a likelihood that funding for women’s studies centres will seize. “How many universities will then fund the centres out of their own resources?” questioned Samita Sen of Jadhavpur University. Uncertainty in funding has a been a hallmark of women’s studies centres since their inception, she added as part of a panel at the convention. “There has never been a golden age.”

However, according to Zenetta Rosaline, director of the department of women’s studies at Bharathiar University, despite the uncertainty of long-term funding, “we have still managed to move forward.”

Students were also among the panelists at the event, and apart from stressing on the need for strengthening women’s studies centres they also said highlighted on the employability aspect of these disciplines. There should be critical thinking with marketable skills, according to Arpita Anand, a Phd student at Ambedkar University, Delhi.

Crisis in higher education

Several panelists also highlighted the fact that the crisis that women’s studies centres were facing was reflective of the status of higher education in India. Even mainstream disciplines are full of only ad hoc faculty. “Crisis of higher education in the whole country has reverberated in women’s students,” said Bhattacharya. The slash of funding, said Anand, will lead to seat cuts, prompting a rise in cost of education and will likely give these women’s students centres – where presently students from diverse background study – an elite character.

The funding crunch, agreed Sumi Krishna, a former president of IAWS, doesn’t affect women’s studies centres alone. The UGC notice, she said, has cast a shadow over funding for centres for social exclusion and wildlife ecology centres among others.

According to many, in the present scenario, there is a need to seek other sources of funding to keep the centres alive. It a struggle not just for funding, they said, but also for legitimacy and acceptance.

Despite all their contributions, women’s studies centres have remained marginalised due to continuing and entrenched biases in university structures, and have been able to grow largely due to the backing from the UGC.

The IAWS has thus, as part of a memorandum signed by over 17o present at the convention, urged the UGC to continue to support the 163 women’s studies centre’s currently being assisted. “We urge continuation of central grant support for WSCs until they are regularised as permanent departments with adequate faculty and staff positions and support for activities, i.e., until they are incorporate on equal status with other disciplines in the structure and institutions that govern university and college institutions.”

Despite the looming crisis, however, several remained positive. “We have been in a marginalised location since day one. It is the best place to conduct knowledge and politics,” said Mary John of CWDS. “We’ve known what it means to exist under uncertainty. We can use that knowledge.”"

New Delhi: One and half months after the International Court of Justice judgement, Pakistan announced on Sunday evening that it will grant consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav on September 2. On Monday morning, India accepted the offer.

“Today, after victory in the ICJ, India will be proceeding for consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav. Indian CDA [Charge d’Affaires], Gaurav Ahluwalia, will be meeting Jadhav,” official sources said. “We hope that Pakistan will ensure the right atmosphere so that the meeting is free, fair, meaningful and effective in keeping with the letter and spirit of the ICJ orders.”

Just three days ago, India had reiterated that it wanted “unimpeded” access to Jadhav, who has been sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court.

Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson Mohammed Faisal tweeted on Sunday evening that Jadhav would get consular access “in line with Vienna convention on consular relations, ICJ judgement and the laws of Pakistan”. The meeting is likely to take place around noon local time, as per media reports.

While Pakistan claims that Jadhav is a serving officer who was taken into custody in Balochistan, India has asserted that he had retired from the Indian Navy and was kidnapped from Iran.

India dragged Pakistan to the International Court of Justice in 2017, when the latter refused to grant consular access to Jadhav despite repeated requests. Pakistan has claimed that consular access with India for individuals charged with espionage and terrorism is governed by a bilateral agreement.

The ICJ, however, agreed with India’s view through an order on July 17 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s right under VCCR’s article 36. However, ICJ did not order Jadhav’s release, as India had asked, but instead called for a review of Jadhav’s trial in light of the violations of his rights.

Following the judgment, Pakistan first offered to hold the consular access on August 2, as per Pakistani laws. India had rejected the offer by stating that Pakistan had to provide “unimpeded consular access to Shri Kulbhushan Jadhav, in an environment free from the fear of intimidation and reprisal, in the light of the orders of the International Court of Justice”.

For India, “unimpeded” consular access means that Indian officials should be able to have a confidential conversation with Jadhav without any fear of being overheard by an escorting Pakistan official or through electronic surveillance. Pakistan, however, insists that there is no explicit provision for private conversations as per international law or domestic legislation.

Following the ICJ judgment, relations between India and Pakistan have further deteriorated over developments on Kashmir. There has been heightened rhetoric, but both sides have kept negotiations over consular access to Jadhav largely out of the media limelight.

US Senate Fails to Pass Amendment to Boost Defence Sales to India,https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/us-senate-fails-to-pass-amendment-to-boost-defence-sales-to-india,"Jun 16, 2016  |  Lalit K. Jha","Washington: They clapped and cheered when Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a joint sitting of the Senate and House of Representatives but a legislative amendment that aims to bring US defence sales to India at par with the US’s close allies and NATO members failed to get the the Senate’s nod on June 15.

Called “Enhancing Defence and Security Co-operation with India”, the legislative amendment was moved by Illinois senator Mark Kirk on May 25 as part of the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) 2017.

“Unfortunately the Senator’s amendment was not included in the final NDAA FY17,” a congressional aide to the senator told PTI.

Notably, the US House of Representatives has already passed a similar amendment attached to the NDAA-2017. The two versions of the bill would now have to be reconciled by both the chambers of the Congress through conference. It is only after the common version of the bill is passed that US President Barack Obama would sign that into law.

Another amendment moved by senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, that sought to recognise India as a global strategic and defence partner by making necessary modifications to defence export control regulations could not get the Senate’s nod either.

The legislative move is not linked with the recent joint India-US statement in which the Obama administration had recognised India as a “Major Defence Partner”.

The statement was issued last week after the meeting between Obama and Modi at the White House.

As per the joint statement, as ‘major defence partners’, the US will continue to work toward facilitating technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners, it had said.

India, however, downplayed the US Senate rejecting a key amendment recognising the country as “global strategic and defence partner”, saying it would be “premature” to speculate about its final content. External affairs ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said, “We have seen media reports about non-inclusion of an India-related amendment in the consideration of the NDAA by the US Senate. The preparation of the NDAA in the US Congress involves approval of different versions in the House of Representatives and the Senate, and their reconciliation to evolve a single consensual text, which is again put to vote in both chambers.”



He also said that preparation of the NDAA is a process distinct from the decision of the US government to recognise India as a Major Defence Partner. “This was an executive decision and already announced in the India-US joint statement of June 7. A number of senators and congressmen have moved proposals that only seek to reinforce this decision of the US government. It reflects the bipartisan support in the US Congress for stronger defence cooperation between India and the US,” Swarup added.

Meanwhile, McCain in a statement expressed disappointment over the fact that even though they had bipartisan support they could not get the proposed changes through the Senate as part of NDAA-2017.

“I regret that the senate was unable to debate and vote on several matters critical to our national security, many of which enjoyed broad bipartisan support,” McCain said without specifically mentioning the legislative amendment related to India.

The McCain amendment said that the relationship between the US and India has developed over the past two decades to become a multifaceted, global, strategic and defence partnership rooted in shared democratic values and the promotion of mutual prosperity, greater economic cooperation, regional peace, security, and stability.

Arun Jaitley Spars With Economists Who Doubted Credibility of Official Data,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/arun-jaitley-spars-with-economists-who-doubted-credibility-of-official-data,"Mar 20, 2019  |  Indivjal Dhasmana","New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday took on 108 economists who had questioned the credibility of official data last week. He said “70% of these so-called economists are compulsive contrarians”, a term he had coined to thrash opponents of the Narendra Modi government earlier.

On a video released on Twitter, Jaitley said, “When the economy is growing on various fronts, how can one argue that jobs are not being created?”

Saying that 108 “so-called economists” had questioned the validity of official data a few days ago, the finance minister said they are critics of the government who have signed multiple memorandums against it in the last five years.

Most of these memorandums are on issues of politics and not economics, he emphasised.

“As against this, credible international institutions like the IMF and the World Bank have always accepted our data,” he said.

He said these economists believed the Indian economy has not created jobs, which is a myth.

To validate his point, he said infrastructure growth in this government has been the fastest.

He said this government builds 10,000 km of highways every year, has electrified every village, provided sanitation to every home, built houses, created urban infrastructure at unprecedented growth of metros, fly overs, roads.

“When the construction industry grows by 10%, when the electronics industry where we essentially relied on imports is today having a monumental growth as far as India is concerned and lastly huge infrastructure is being created in rural areas, in urban areas, manufacturing is going up in various sectors, the economy is the fastest growing, a fake campaign (has been launched) that all this growth does not create jobs. I think nothing could be further from truth,” he said, countering the economists.

On Thursday last, a group of 108 economists and social scientists called upon their colleagues from across the ideological spectrum to impress upon the government, irrespective of the party in power, “to restore access and integrity to public statistics, and re-establish institutional independence and integrity to the statistical organisations”.

“The national and global reputation of India’s statistical bodies is at stake. More than that, statistical integrity is crucial for generating data that would feed into economic policy-making and that would make for honest and democratic public discourse,” the economists said in an official statement.

They said that it was imperative that agencies associated with the collection and dissemination of statistics like the Central Statistical Office and the National Sample Survey Organisation not be subject to political interference.

The signatories included prominent economists and social scientists like Abhijit Banerjee, Pranab Bardhan, Jean Dreze, James Boyce, Jayati Ghosh, Amartya Lahiri, Sudha Narayanan, Ashima Sood, Jayan Jose Thomas, Vamsi Vakulabharanam and others.

Economists statement:

“Lately, the Indian statistics and the institutions associated with it have however come under a cloud for being influenced and indeed even controlled by political considerations. In fact, any statistics that cast an iota of doubt on the achievement of the government seem to get revised or suppressed on the basis of some questionable methodology.”

Jaitley’s counter:

“A few days ago, 108 so-called economists issued a statement questioning its (official data’s) validity. I analysed those economists and found out that 70 per cent of them are compulsive contrarians, critics of the government who have signed multiple memorandums against this government in the last five years. Most of these memorandums are on the issues of politics and not economics.”

"Slowing Credit, Output Cuts and Job Losses Aren't Anecdotal, Mr. Jaitley",https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/first-signs-demonetisation-economic-impact-becoming-visible,"Jan 10, 2017  |  Anuj Srivas","While Arun Jaitley talks of increased tax collection, banks are battling historically-low credit growth and small and medium businesses are staring at drastically decreased revenues.

New Delhi: While the medium-term impact of demonetisation may eventually be decided in terms of GDP loss versus the prospect of a potentially larger formal economy – setting aside whether the liquidity windfall that has hit India’s banks will be permanent or temporary – the last week has thrown up a handful of signals what the short-term scenario will look like.

On Monday, finance minister Arun Jaitley kicked things off by rubbishing “anecdotal claims” of a slowdown amongst India’s small and medium businesses and said that the collection of both indirect and direct taxes had registered “good growth” in the month of December.

Suggesting that the impact of demonetisation on economic activity had been limited, Jaitley added that most states had reported an increase in VAT collections in December, and that “well-administered states had not seen any impact on tax collections”.

AIMO study

Jaitley was of course responding to not only mounting anecdotal evidence of mass rural migration, as a result of the urban informal economy taking a hit, but also a study released by the All India Manufacturer’s Organisation (AIMO) on Monday.

The AIMO study points out that in the first 34 days since demonetisation, micro and small-scale industries on average cut 35% of their workforce and saw an up to 50% dip in revenue. The AIMO represents over three lakh micro, small-scale and medium-scale industries engaged in manufacturing and export activities.

Why has and the small-and-medium business industry been hit so badly by demonetisation? To be sure, there are a few economic factors apart from demonetisation at play: there’s some evidence to show that the Indian economy was slowing down a bit even before notebandi, uncertainty over GST remains a concern and a weaker rupee was also playing spoilsport.

The AIMO study points out that after demonetisation, zero cash inflows, rules curtailing cash withdrawals, staff absenteeism, an inability of banks to work on proposals and a derailed real estate sector created further havoc.

Apart from just SME businesses, medium and large-scale industries engaged in infrastructure projects, such as big-ticket road construction, also “reported an average 35% cut in jobs and a 45% loss in revenues”.

Slowdown in bank credit growth

The second visible sign of how demonetisation has impacted the Indian economy is the plunging of bank credit growth to a historic low.

An SBI report, produced by the economic research wing of the bank, notes that “fortnightly data of ASCB indicates that credit off-take (YoY) has declined to a historical low of 5.1% as on December 23, 2016”. Just after demonetisation, from November 11 to December 23, credit off-take has “declined by Rs 5,229 crore while banks’ deposits grew by around Rs 4 lakh crore”.

What does this mean, that the Indian banking system’s credit growth is at a near 20-year-low? Simply put, corporate borrowers not see future economic activity or demand that would prod them into borrowing money.

The RBI’s data shows that there is a slowdown in credit for the month that demonetisation was announced (November) and a slowdown in credit across most sectors on YTD (year-to-date) basis. The table below (Table 1) shows that on a year-on-year basis, the only sector that saw an increase in credit growth was services and automobiles (vehicle loans). SBI chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh notes that “major sub-sectors in ‘Industry’ which witness deceleration/contraction in credit include infrastructure, food processing, chemical and chemical products, all engineering, textiles and basic metal and metal products”.

Market economist largely agree that credit growth could slip to 6% in the next financial year, and that the drop in November and December were largely due to demonetisation. CRISIL’s chief economist DK Joshi notes that while credit growth has been low throughout 2016, the significant drop in the last two months was because of demonetisation’s disruptions. “Otherwise there was no reason for credit growth to fall. The economy was looking up, there was the pay commission hike, there were good rains, and some interest rate cuts were being passed on to borrowers, which would have created more demand for credit,” he told The Times of India.

Sectoral Deployment of Credit in November 2016 (Table 1)

YoY Growth (%) YTD Growth FY’ 16 (Nov’15) FY’ 17 (Nov’16) FY’16 (April-Nov) FY’17 (April-Nov) Bank Credit 8.6 4.0 4.0 -0.8 NF Credit 8.8 4.8 3.9 -0.2 Agr & Allied 11.8 10.3 7.9 3.2 Industry 5.0 -3.4 0.4 -5.5 Services 6.8 7.1 1.9 0.1 Personal Loans 18.0 15.2 11.9 8.0 Housing 18.6 15.6 12.2 9.2 Vehicle 15.5 21.4 10.7 9.4 Source: SBI Research and RBI data

The Indian banking system in the last week has reacted predictably to the slowdown in banking credit growth. Flush with an “unprecedented surge in liquidity” – courtesy the Rs 14 lakh of demonetised currency that has come back into the system – SBI cut its lending rates by 90 bps. Most other public sector and private sector banks also reduced their MCLR in the range of 10-85 basis points.

How much will this help, bearing in mind that the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy has noted that the average daily value of new investment proposals announced since November 8 have slumped by nearly 60%?

An SBI analysis shows that from November 2008 to August 2010, banks had slashed lending rates (back when it was BPLR) by 75-80 bps and “there was an incremental credit growth of around Rs 7.3 lakh crore from an yearly average growth of Rs. 4 lakh crore”. After banks shifted away from the BPLR mechanism of pricing lending rates, there was a decline in rates which “pushed average credit growth 22.0% during July 2010 to march 2011.

Consequently, a SBI report believes that credit growth could pick up. The housing sector, for instance, could be one bright spot. Even during the demonetisation months of November and December, “housing credit managed an increase of Rs 4,063 crore”.

The slump in credit growth should not take away from two other fundamental concerns. The first is the general and acute shortfall in bank capital. Secondly, the general slowdown in small-and-medium businesses and the Modi government’s decision to underwrite loans to this sector up to Rs 2 crore. As commentator Andy Mukherjee notes and as the AIMO study makes clear, this is not a sector you want propping up the Indian banking system’s credit growth at the moment. Not atleast until the process of re-monetisation is over and free-flowing cash supply has been restored.

Jaitley right or wrong?

Lastly, how much truth is there to Jaitley’s statement on increased tax collections being a sign of a healthy economy? Or a sign of demonetisation not having had a negative economic impact? In his speech, he notes that advance tax collections were up 14% in December (y-o-y) and that indirect tax collections from April- December 2016 and central excise collections from April- December 2016 were up 25% and 43% respectively.

There are two caveats that should be kept in mind here. Firstly, in 2013-14, when GDP growth was at a dismal 4.7% (later revised after base year changes), direct taxes and indirect taxes grew by 14% and 15%! Tax collection therefore, in general, is not a good sign of GDP growth or the healthiness of an economy, experts say. Increased collection could simply point to better compliance or tax administration in that specific year.

Secondly, as a number of commentators have noted, the whopping increase in central excise collections largely comes taxes on from the oil and gas sector. An-ever increasing excise tax on petrol and diesel is why indirect tax collection has increased. As The Wire reported, in late December 2015 and early 2016, the excise duty on petrol diesel was hiked five times over just three months, increasing the excise duty on petrol by 34%.

Therefore increased tax collection says very little about the effect of demonetisation on India’s economy. The developments that we need to watch out ahead include the Union Budget and what role it will play in increasing consumer demand, looking out for whether the Indian banking system’s liquidity windfall will last, and how the recapitalisation of banks will play out."
Norway Advocates Restraint Over Indian Child Custody,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-norway-child-custody-welfare,"Dec 24, 2016  |  The Wire Staff","India, on the other hand, said it it is ready to intervene if a formal request is made by the mother.

New Delhi: The Norwegian embassy on Friday called for “restraint”, even as India said that it was ready to intervene if the mother, an Indian citizen, approached the government for help in getting back her son from Norway’s child welfare services.

On Dec 13, Norway child services had taken away a five-year-old boy into foster care over allegations of abuse. While the father is a Norwegian citizen of Indian origin, the mother is an Indian passport holder.

Following Indian media reporting on the case, the embassy of Norway issued a statement on Friday stating that child welfare cases are handled as per the Norwegian Child Welfare Act, which incorporates the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

“The Act applies to all children in Norway, regardless of their background, residential status or citizenship. The basic principle of the Act is that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration,” said the statement.

Refusing to go further into the details, the embassy noted that children welfare cases are “highly sensitive” and “are therefore subject to strict duty of confidentiality”.

“The Embassy, therefore, requests restraint and assures that the Norwegian authorities are dealing with the case with complete sensitivity,” it said, adding that public updates will be made available when available.

In Delhi, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Vikas Swarup said that external affairs minster Sushma Swaraj was herself monitoring the case.

He said legal proceedings were currently underway for continuation of the custody by Norway’s child welfare services. “We are informed that the father has engaged a Norwegian lawyer to pursue the matter in the court”.

Swarup said that India can only intervene if there is a formal request made by the mother.

“Given the seriousness of the issue, should we receive a formal representation from the mother, who is an Indian national, our Embassy remains fully prepared to engage with local authorities to impress upon them that this is a humanitarian issue and that the separation of a child from his parents is a matter of distress to the entire family”.

In 2011, two Indian children were also taken into custody by Norway’s child welfare service after complaints of abuse. After India exerted diplomatic pressure at the highest levels and months of negotiation, they returned to India after an year in foster care."

While government is of the view that the nature of the tax reform required it to be a shock, implementing it in a phased manner could have helped avoid much of the disruptions being experienced.

Last week, the Indian government tinkered once again with the tax reform introduced on July 1. While it is to be appreciated that the government is responding to the difficulties being faced in the economy, could the basic reform itself have been substantially different in the first place? Now the political view in the government – and sometimes even the academic view – appears to be that since the newly-introduced Goods and Services Tax (GST) involves goods and services, the Centre and the states, buyers and sellers and one indirect tax vis-à-vis a multiplicity of indirect taxes, it could not have been anything but a big bang disruptive reform.

However, the reform could have been gradual.

Consider the following hypothetical administrative system in the absence of the GST. In other words, the old-style taxes are still in place. The government picks up, say, the cement industry. A cement manufacturer is chosen at random, and told to provide a list of those it has sold its cement to. Suppose that cement has been sold to 26 different dealers (who, in turn, sell to builders who use cement in actual construction). Let us label these 26 dealers as A, B, C, … Z. Next, the government picks a dealer at random. Suppose this is dealer A. Now, the government inspects the accounting records of the cement manufacturer to find out the quantity and price of cement sold to dealer A. The government also inspects the accounting records of dealer A to find out the quantity and price of cement it had purchased from the manufacturer. If the quantity and price in the two separate records are the same (and the taxes are computed in accordance with the accounting records), then it is clear that there has been no attempt at hiding anything in this context. However, if the records do not match, then either or both parties are possibly involved in some wrongdoing. This opens the door for further investigation. On completion of the investigation, appropriate penalties, if needed, can be imposed on the wrongdoer(s). It can also help, as Suranjali Tandon and Kavita Rao have shown in a recent research paper, to include stigma alongside monetary liabilities.

The above illustration is in the context of the cement industry and its dealers. But the methodology is more general. It can be used for any industry and its dealers. Indeed, it can be used for any business-to-business transaction. This may involve a manufacturer and a dealer. Or it may involve one dealer and another dealer. It may also involve one manufacturer and another manufacturer. The application of methodology can be on a large scale. However, as already mentioned, it can be done selectively on a random basis. The idea is to keep a check on the costs of administration. Furthermore, there can be a possible check of the government officials to keep the probability of collusion between government officials and taxpayers low. This can help keep a check on wrongdoing. It can also check the use of bogus firms in evasion of indirect taxes.

In the above model, the investigating agency is from the central government rather than from any of the states because of the possibility of the seller being from one state and the buyer from another. In such situations, it would be appropriate for the government to be involved in a (random) check. The investigating agency of the government can, in turn, inform the concerned tax department, which can be at the state or central level depending on whether the indirect tax evaded falls in the jurisdiction of the Centre or the states, given the multiplicity of the old tax structure. The concerned tax department can take the necessary action to recover the tax under the proposed plan.

Detecting tax evasion

Observe that in this alternative model, no GST is involved. Thus, GST is not necessary to keep a check on evasion of indirect taxes. This is not to say that GST should not be adopted, instead that it should be done separately after tax compliance has improved significantly. That way, there is hardly any disruption to economic activities because the public authorities are, under the proposed plan, attempting to accomplish one objective at a time.

In contrast, GST – as it has been introduced – is a big bang reform that is at once targeted at keeping a check on tax evasion and at making the indirect tax system more efficient. There exists an alternative plan that can address both concerns and yet avoids significant disruption. Broadly speaking, the changes in the tax regime could have been brought about in two different phases:

Improve tax compliance within the framework of the multiplicity of taxes, and the old tax rates (basically, without introducing any GST), and

Introduce GST after tax compliance has improved substantially.

The old tax system that prevailed till July 1 already included a value-added tax (VAT). So, this makes it easier to match the records of the buyers and the sellers. Even where VAT was absent, in any case the records of the buyers and sellers need to match. This enables the investigating agencies to detect evasion of taxes and impose appropriate penalties where required. Ex-ante, given that the investigating agencies may match the records of buyers and sellers, the tax compliance can improve.

The above is a simplified and stylised picture of detecting possible evasion of indirect taxes. There is, of course, a need to use expertise on various details; the expertise can be based on theory and evidence from all over the world. The objective is not to achieve perfect tax compliance in phase (a); it is instead to bring about a significant improvement.

A gradual approach

Indira Rajaraman has suggested a random check instead of a comprehensive check within the big bang reform as it stands in practice. This is a welcome suggestion. However, it can be used within phase (a) of the plan proposed in this article before GST is to be introduced under phase (b) of the proposed plan.

It is true that phase (a) would need changes in the structure of tax administration and in the budget for tax administration. It would also entail an increased manpower. It would require changes in legislation. It would also require (more) co-ordination between Centre and states. Last but not the least, it would need political support and the political will to improve tax compliance. But all this is required anyway even under the big bang reform. In fact, all such changes are required on a smaller scale initially under the proposed plan as only phase (a) needs to be implemented to begin with.

In fact, even within phase (a), the changes can be brought in, say, five different sub-phases. These can be sub-phases (a.1), (a.2), (a.3), (a.4) and (a.5). Suppose that the Indian economy can be meaningfully divided into five sectors (for illustration). Then sub-phase (a.1) can be introduced in the first year, sub-phase (a.2) can be introduced in the second year, and so on till sub-phase (a.5) is introduced in the fifth year. After five years of implementing phase (a), the government can proceed to bring about phase (b). Note that it is the changes in phase (b) which need to be brought about in one go but the changes in phase (a) can be further subdivided. This is because it is only under phase (b) that the GST will be introduced under the proposed plan.

Phase (a) is, in a sense, preparatory as it keeps bringing ‘firms’ in the informal sector under the tax net, and as it keeps making the firms in the formal sector more tax compliant. This happens first for firms related to sector one, then to firms related to sector two and so on till firms related to sector five are covered.

The advantage of a gradual approach is that it gives time to businesses, tax departments and professionals like chartered accountants and lawyers to learn and adapt. The word spreads from one firm to another on the need to change and on the modalities of change. This avoids disruption. The Indian economy has already gone through the adverse aftereffects of demonetisation on output and employment; a recent CMIE report by Mahesh Vyas shows that 1.5 million jobs were lost in the first four months of 2017. Even though it is hard to be sure that this is a direct consequence of demonetisation alone, it helps to bring about tax reforms in a phased manner to the extent possible.

There is a large literature on Transition and Economics. Though much of this is in the context of transition from a planned economy to a market economy, the broader lessons can be applied to the transition from a variety of indirect taxes to GST in India. In this context, this literature suggests that a gradual approach can be better than a shock therapy.

Will COVID-19 Lockdowns Generate Public Support for Climate Change Mitigation?,https://m.thewire.in/article/environment/covid-19-lockdown-public-support-climate-change-mititgation,"Apr 30, 2020  |  Rama Mohana R. Turaga","In the article published in The Wire Science on April 4, Siddarth Goel presented a good analysis of the initial impact, including the response of business and government, of the ongoing global pandemic on the environment, particularly climate change. The article ends with a note suggesting that heightened awareness and support among the general public might determine whether the current crisis will provide a more conducive environment in the future for improved climate action. In the context of the prevailing uncertainty around the pandemic, it is foolhardy to attempt any predictions; nevertheless, in this article, I will examine extant academic research to understand the likely impact of the pandemic on public support for environmental protection in general and climate change mitigation in particular.

The economic impact of COVID-19

While the world is trying to come to terms with the rising infections and the death toll, which is close to 217,674 (as of April 29), the mass lockdowns announced across the major economies in order to flatten the spread of the virus has brought to focus the potentially huge economic impact of these containment measures. One of the most visible impacts has been on jobs. The US data on unemployment benefit claims shows a loss of 16 million jobs in three weeks since the onset of the crisis. In India, the already bad unemployment numbers are made worse with the urban unemployment rising to 31% and the overall unemployment rate to 23%. Globally, the International Labor Organisation expects a job loss equivalent to 195 million full-time workers in the second quarter of 2020. It is not clear how many of these jobs will return and how quickly after the pandemic crisis subsides. The International Monetary Fund estimates negative economic growth in most countries and for India, the latest prediction is no GDP growth during 2020.

The economic impact is already reflected in the public sentiment, as indicated by a few opinion polls that have begun to capture the mood of the general public during this crisis. A poll of 10,000 individuals across 12 countries including India, conducted by Ipsos, found that people view COVID-19 as much, if not more, an economic crisis as a public health crisis. Majorities in most countries foresee a personal financial impact. In India, 71% of the respondents perceive personal risk to their health due to COVID-19, whereas 75% foresee a personal financial impact.

Economy and public preference for environmental protection

What does this mean to public support for environmental protection and climate change mitigation going forward? Prior research does not exactly provide good news. Using both aggregate data (at the country or state-level) as well as individual-level respondent data, this research consistently shows that support tends to be lower during economic recessions. Using survey data from the World Values Survey, I studied the support for environmental protection over economic growth in India over two periods: 2006, when Indian economy was booming and 2014, when the GDP growth was in a prolonged decline. The results were consistent from other countries. The support for environmental protection was significantly lower in 2014 compared to 2006, controlling for other individual characteristics. While a coherent theoretical explanation for this phenomenon is lacking, one prominent explanation relates to the role of media framing, which may amplify economic issues and underplay environmental and climate change issues during economic recessions.

Climate change mitigation post COVID-19

Thus prior research suggests that the adverse economic impact resulting from the lockdowns is likely to reduce public support for environmental protection and climate change mitigation. Strong public support is important for a wide range of environmental policies, especially those policies that provide future benefits but require immediate investments and prove to be costly in the short run. Even during normal economic conditions, climate advocates in many countries, particularly the US, have been struggling to mobilise public support for a more aggressive climate action. Research shows that even when climate change mitigation policies are framed as being beneficial to the economy, enhanced public support for climate mitigation policies is unlikely.

Climate science is unequivocal that we are rapidly building towards potentially catastrophic impacts from climate change in the absence of strong action. Is there a path in which we can mobilise greater public support for climate action using the experience from the COVID-19 crisis, in spite of the adverse economic impacts that most people will experience? An interesting insight from the public opinion polls of Ipsos cited earlier is that a good proportion of respondents are willing to support strong measures such as closing down the country borders even when such measures might affect the economy and in turn their own jobs or financial status.

In the survey conducted by the National Council of Applied Economic Research in the National Capital Region (NCR), more than 85% of the respondents supported the extension of nationwide lockdown in India by another two weeks, beyond the initial three weeks, although 85% reported losing income and wages during the first lockdown. This suggests that the public is willing to support strong measures to reduce the impacts from COVID-19 even if they are associated with negative economic impact.

An implication of these findings for mobilising public support for aggressive climate actions post-pandemic might be to use climate science to construct possible scenarios of climate crisis with which the larger public can relate based on their immediate experience during the ongoing pandemic. An opportunity might be to make more salient the potential health impacts of climate change, including the likelihood of the increasing occurrence of infectious disease.

A strand of emerging empirical research has been demonstrating that framing climate change mitigation actions in terms of their health benefits is likely to increase public engagement and support for climate mitigation policies. This could be quite challenging though, given that unlike the pandemic crisis, the health impacts of climate change are likely to be less dramatic and visible and establishing cause-effect relationship between climate change and its impacts is much less straightforward.

In an interview to Wired, the epidemiologist Larry Brilliant said: “The whole epidemiological community has been warning everybody for the past 10 or 15 years that it wasn’t a question of whether we were going to have a pandemic like this. It was simply when.” Clearly our collective failure globally to respond effectively to the pandemic crisis is a reflection of our inability to act on available science. The warnings from climate scientists now are perhaps similar to that of epidemiologists 10-15 years ago. If we do not learn our lessons from this crisis and act aggressively on climate change, we may, unfortunately, end up with a similar crisis sooner than we can imagine now.

It is an imperative that needs absolute unity of purpose and complete trust amongst all humankind. How we confront the menace will not only make a life-and-death difference to us all but will go down in posterity as our contribution to succeeding generations.

To see some people continue to underscore imagined communal divergence in this dark hour makes one wonder if we have decided to be suicidal. Whatever the purveyors of hate might think they are achieving by the toxicity of their discourse, it is not going unnoticed across the globe. People elsewhere might have taken to conservatism but inclusive democracy has not been repudiated entirely. Populism might lead countries to pay a price they not have anticipated but nowhere in the world will current decisions cause irreversible damage to civilisational values. Sadly, in India we are on the verge of losing our liberal moorings as we go adrift in an unfathomed sea of hate disguised as imagined victimhood, myopic minority appeasement and self-centred majoritarianism.

Having for years discouraged people from seeking exclusive community representation because of alleged communal implications, Muslim public figures are being asked to comment on and condemn real or imagined transgressions of people and organisations co-incidentally associated with their community.

The Tablighi Jamaat is an extreme case, given their mysterious credentials and character as indeed the over zealous attempts of their detractors to amplify their short-sightedness and insensitivity. Prima facie, it will be impossible to pin criminal liability given the facts that are available in the public space. Even negligence will have to be stretched somewhat to make them culpable without establishing mens rea. Of course, one person infected is certainly one too many but the figures that we hear are either grossly exaggerated or a result of concentrated testing of Jamaat members. Be that as it may, they have certainly walked into a storm and not helped themselves or the Muslims at large.

And yet the blame or responsibility most objective observers place on the Jamaat will not explain the false allegations about a guard in Defence Colony, the vegetable seller somewhere in Delhi, or the tragic lynchings that have taken place in India in the name of COVID-19. Is it not true that vendors are being warned not to enter streets if they are Muslim?

The BJP had good reason to be comfortable with its majoritarian agenda and believes it to be its guarantee for winning successive elections. Party leaders might yet be wrong on this, at least in many states. But they seem to have secured a safe haven in Uttar Pradesh, where the BSP-SP combine has handed over the state to the BJP, wiped out the Congress and squeezed themselves into a meaningless, minor presence in the Lok Sabha. The Congress has been doing badly for a while but not entirely due to the rise of the BJP. Our decline started with the riots of the 1980s and Ayodhya; the BSP and SP ruthlessly clawed our traditional vote and now with fresh rounds of violence that had an imprint of state sponsorship and Ayodhya a done deal for the BJP, we hear not a whisper from them – just as in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal distances himself from Shaheen Bagh and JNU students, and unselfconsciously paints the Tablighi Jamaat in the darkest colours.

Congress leaders and workers who are Muslim but chose not to be mere ‘Muslim leaders’ are expected virtually daily to speak up against some indiscretion some Muslim has indulged in. Every report of rape and murder is read with anxiety and trepidation in the hope that the perpetrator is not a Muslim. Every assault or lynching of a Muslim makes them look around for a colleague from the majority community to speak out lest a communal colour be given. When party colleagues welcomed the judgment in favour of the Ayodhya temple, we demurred on appreciating the ‘balancing’ exercise by the court granting land for a mosque. When triple talaq was criminalised, we kept quiet despite having compelling arguments on why the new law was unnecessary. When Article 370 was abrogated, we pretended it had nothing to do with us, even as some young party colleagues echoed the BJP line. On the Uniform Civil Code, we remain perplexed.

Shaheen Bagh came as a burst of energy shattering pre-conceived notions but showed us how irrelevant we were to our community’s aspirations. Now, as the police retaliates by resorting to vague charges of sedition and terrorism, we remain helpless bystanders.

For years we have engaged in strategic expression because we know that polarisation hurts us and our party. And then we are told that we cannot mould our community to modern requirements. Meanwhile, the community thinks it can happily bypass us and deal with the party, even the BJP, directly on a need basis.

Of late, some have even gathered under the banner of ‘Indian Muslims for India First’, as though we need to present our certificates of allegiance afresh. If we are of India and India is ours, why the need to say such things again and again? From Akbar to Bahadur Shah Zafar, Brig Usman to Havaldar Abdul Hamid, Maulana Azad to Zakir Husain, Dilip Kumar to Shahrukh Khan, Meena Kumari to Shabana Azmi, Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali to Amjad Khan, Mirza Ghalib to Javed Akhtar, Nawab Pataudi to Azharuddin, Syed Zahoor Qasim to Abdul Kalam, Chief Justice of India Hidayatullah to Chief Justice Badar Ahmed of J&K High Court et al, there are unending legions who never placed India any less than first.

Changes in politics and emerging social conditions have made people like us virtually unelectable. Farrukhabad, the constituency that elected me twice and even in defeat gave me more than a lakh votes, relegated me in 2019 to a position where voting for me would be a waste. But it matters not. The daunting barricades of political indifference I confront will not persuade me to look for greener pastures. Rather, circumstances force me to search for a sense of belonging in a seemingly long march to freedom from our current predicament.

India retains a place for inclusive, secular politics but we cannot secure that for ourselves if we do not believe, as is the case with some friends, that there is such a place. It is true that too many of us have seen the political world from the prism of what there is in it for us. It makes sense too, given that politics is a full time career in our country. But ideological comfort is also about self esteem and intellectual ambition. As ideology takes a back seat and allows transactional politics to drive us all,, we have an existential choice to make.

It matters not who the preferred soldiers are in our army of volunteers so long as we know that together we are honestly and unreservedly fighting for the Gandhian and Nehruvian vision of India. If some of our colleagues and comrades are persuaded that we need to move on to modern day machinations minus ideology, we must get rid of them, no matter their numbers, or else they must vanquish us. The battle for the Idea of India will not be lost because we chose to compromise our conscience, for other valiants will take our place. We have to choose between going down fighting for a noble cause and surrendering timorously to the ignoble trends of our times.

The fight for democracy cannot be premised on limited democracy. The imperfections of democracy, of course, must not be an alibi for ditching democracy. But equally, its imperfections should not be caused by our own weaknesses. People who assume a brave new world will unfold by itself in the post COVID-19 era should not nurture the illusion that it will be business as usual for their ambitions. Justice as fairness must inform all our actions; constitutional morality must be our guide; equal respect and consideration must be our credo. The pilot project of these building blocks of new India must be earnestly implemented in our party to make it the vehicle of transformation once again. No longer should we fear defeat and death, having seen it both from near. It is time to be re-born.

Watch: 'Govt Callousness Towards Millions Who Are Starving Endangers India's Democracy',https://m.thewire.in/article/government/watch-karan-thapar-interview-yamini-aiyar,"Apr 28, 2020  |  Karan Thapar","The president of one of India’s highly-regarded think tanks, the Centre for Policy Research, has said that the manner in which the central government has responded to the plight of tens or hundreds of millions of daily wage workers and unemployed unorganised sector workers has placed India’s democracy in danger.

Yamini Aiyar says she is seriously worried.

In a 25-minute interview to Karan Thapar for The Wire, Aiyar said: “A democracy that treats its citizens with callousness and a complete lack of compassion, cannot survive, regardless of the consequences of the epidemic.”

When specifically asked if she was saying the allegedly callous manner in which the Modi government has responded to the plight of India’s tens of millions of poor and vulnerable during the lockdown was placing India’s democracy in danger, she said, “yes”.

In the interview to The Wire, Aiyar spelled out the steps the government needs to urgently take to help the poor and vulnerable. The top three are: immediate universalisation of PDS ration distribution, an immediate cash payment which, depending on the states concerned, might have to involve the physical handing over of money as is happening in parts of Odisha and arrangements to transport migrants stuck in shelters or state borders to their homes."
Why India Needs Scheduled Tribes to Educate its Future Judges,https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/why-india-needs-scheduled-tribes-to-educate-future-judges,"Apr 28, 2020  |  Nandini Sundar","The recent five-judge bench Supreme Court judgment in Chebrolu Leela Prasad Rao and Ors v State of AP and Ors, shows us once again how little the 5th Schedule of the Indian constitution which is meant to protect adivasi rights is understood.

The reasoning in the judgment – which struck down an Andhra Pradesh government order from 2000 providing 100% reservation for Scheduled Tribe teachers in Scheduled Areas of the state – moves perilously close to dismantling the entire edifice of the 5th Schedule.

If 100% reservation for teaching jobs is not permissible, the next step will be for someone to argue against the ban on alienation of tribal land, or overturn the Samata judgment prohibiting mining leases being given to non-tribals in 5th Schedule Areas in undivided Andhra Pradesh. After all, both these ‘discriminate’ against non-tribals. As non-adivasis from other districts flood scheduled areas leading to clear demographic change, the clamour to do away with the protective provisions of the 5th Schedule is only getting louder.

The Andhra Pradesh G.O. of 2000 was aimed at promoting education in tribal areas and addressing the problem of rampant teacher absenteeism. As anyone even slightly acquainted with the problems of tribal areas knows, non-tribal teachers are often reluctant to travel to or live in remote adivasi hamlets. Another big problem is language. Many non-tribals, including lower government officials, have lived for years in tribal areas without feeling the need to learn tribal languages. At the primary level, mutual incomprehension between non-tribal teachers and tribal students hampers the basic education of children.

The judges tell us that “It is an obnoxious idea that tribals only should teach the tribals” (para 133), but for far too long, the really obnoxious idea that has pervaded the educational system and is reflected in judgments like this one is that only non-tribals should teach tribals, to “uplift and mainstream” them because “their language and their primitive way of life makes them unfit to put up with the mainstream and to be governed by the ordinary laws” (para 107).

Also Read: Andhra Order on 100% Reservation for ST Teachers Was Response to Maoist Challenge

A standard view is that expressed by Justice S.B. Sinha in his (minority) judgment of the Andhra high court on the same issue in 2001, where non-tribal teachers are axiomatically assumed to be more efficient and meritorious (para 86); and “(f)or upliftment of the educationally backward people, it is necessary to impart education through teachers who are more informed and more meritorious regardless of their caste”(para 126).

For the Supreme Court to say, “They are not supposed to be seen as a human zoo and source of enjoyment of primitive culture and for dance performances” (para 107 of Chebrolu) betrays a mentality that thinks of Scheduled Tribes precisely in those terms rather than as people with the right to define their own educational future. For far too long, education in India has been seen by the establishment as a ‘civilising’ mission designed to make adivasis and dalits into mental clones of the upper castes, even if they continue in their subordinate jobs. Merit is defined merely as efficiency in achieving this goal, rather than in terms of success in tapping indigenous ecological knowledge, preserving adivasi languages and culture and giving confidence to adivasi students by acting as role models. Even though many adivasi teachers have also internalised this idea of non-tribal superiority, having hundred per cent adivasi teachers in Scheduled areas is a small step towards reversing this condescension.

The idea behind the order goes back to the educational experiments pursued by anthropologists and advisors to the Nizam’s government, Christoph Von Furer-Haimendorf and W.G. Grigson, and the efforts by concerned administrators like B.D. Sharma, S.R. Sankaran, B.N. Yugandhar and E.A.S. Sarma to provide a governmental alternative to the pull of the Naxalites. The legal defence of the government order, however, has fallen to the lot of the anthropologist J.P. Rao, along with adivasi teacher and leader Sondhi Veeriah, as well as lawyers like K. Balagopal and Rajeev Dhawan, who fought the case pro bono.

The Supreme Court judgment came in response to an appeal by non-tribals against the majority 2001 high court judgment, which upheld the G.O. of 2000. The Supreme Court verdict essentially replicates the minority view in the high court in favour of non-tribals.

The court framed four questions for itself:

• the first deals with the power of the governor in 5th Schedule areas to make laws, and whether this can override Part III of the constitution or fundamental rights;

• the second, whether 100% reservation is constitutionally permissible;

• the third, whether the GO involves a classification under Article 16 (1) dealing with equal access to state employment, rather than under 16 (4) which provides for reservation;

• the fourth, to do with the reasonableness of the eligibility requirement for reservation, i.e. continuous residence in the area since 1950.

In answering each of the questions, sadly, the court shows itself unmindful of the realities of the country and the history of the constitution it has inherited.

The scope of the governor’s law-making powers

The court’s first argument in striking down the 100% reservation is that this was in effect a new law, since G.O. Ms. No. 3 of 2000 did not amend the Act dealing specifically with reservation, and rules did not count as an act of parliament or state legislature. Under Section 5 (1) of the 5th Schedule, the governor can only apply or decide not to apply laws that have been framed by the parliament or legislature, not make fresh law. On the same point, the majority judgment of the HC in Pulusam Krishna Murthy had held that “application of law is one of the recognised forms of legislation” (para 21) and “it is illogical to hold that the same power does not extend to delegated legislation” (para 37 of judgment by Justice V.V.S. Rao).

Whichever interpretation one chooses, it is important to remember that when the law-making power of the governor under the 5th Schedule was discussed in the constituent assembly’s Sub-Committee on Excluded and Partially Excluded Areas, the concern raised was not whether s/he could or should make fresh law, but that this power should not be used undemocratically, exercised over and above the elected legislature. It is for this reason that a Tribes Advisory Council was created and the governor was required to refer matters to it. (Para 11b of the sub-committee report). In this case, the Tribes Advisory Council had concurred with the 100% rule.

Fundamental rights vs Fifth Schedule?

On the question it posed to itself – of whether the legislative powers of the governor under Section 5 of the 5th Schedule could override fundamental rights – the Supreme Court answered in the negative.

On the face of it, who would quarrel with the proposition that any governor enacting a law or applying a law to Scheduled areas should be mindful of fundamental rights? For instance, one would hardly condone not applying a law on ‘witch’ killings because it was a ‘customary’ practice. But to argue that fundamental rights – and that too when interpreted narrowly as in this judgment as ‘equality’ for non-tribals– should always trump other parts of the constitution is to forget the way the constitution was crafted to allow for diversity-in-unity, whether Article 370 or its 5th and 6th Schedules.

Both fundamental rights and the 5th and 6th Schedules were intrinsic and coeval pre-conditions to the existence of the constituent assembly (CA). Clause 20 of the cabinet mission plan under which the CA functioned provided for an advisory committee to report on “the list of fundamental rights, the clauses for the protection of minorities, and a scheme for the administration of the tribal and excluded areas.” The rights of the Scheduled Tribes in the Indian constitution are not an act of benevolence to “mainstream and uplift them” but a recognition that the “mainstream” of Indian society has many streams that flow into it, each of them equally valid.

In the framework of the constitution, as Justice V.V.S. Rao noted in the majority judgment of the HC (para 16), there are several laws, including freedom of movement in Article 19 (5), whereby “the protection and interest of Scheduled Tribes would take precedence over the fundamental rights of the non-Scheduled Tribes.”

The Supreme Court makes much of the fact that G.O. of 2000 comes into direct conflict with a presidential order under Article 371 D which takes the district as the unit of recruitment and reservation for jobs. This order came into being since people from some districts of undivided Andhra were grabbing jobs everywhere. The court claims that since non-tribals cannot apply outside their district, and they are barred from Scheduled areas, they lose out on employment altogether. This is, unfortunately, an altogether specious conclusion since Scheduled areas form only a small portion of any district. For example, the Scheduled area in Visakapatnam district (the maximum in any district) is 52.9%, in Srikakulam it is 22.09% and in West Godavari (the lowest) it is 13%. Within these scheduled areas, the STs are in a clear majority and therefore deserve to have teachers from their own language communities – in Paderu/Visakapatnam, STs are 88% of the population, in Srikakulam 78% and in West Godavari, 47%. Outside the scheduled areas, only 6% of the posts are reserved for STs, 15 % for SCs, 25% for Backward Classes and 54 % (in effect) for the upper castes.

The minority HC judgment by Justice Sinha – now endorsed by the Supreme Court – also claimed that 100% reservation for ST teachers discriminated against non-ST students in Scheduled areas:

“If a school is manned by the teachers of a particular class, the students belonging to the other classes would be discriminated against.” (para 111).

It is amazing how those who talk so feelingly about the need for a caste blind society and the problem of casteism only see themselves as victims of caste prejudices. They never consider the possibility that adivasi (and dalit) children taught by caste Hindus may be discriminated against.

Article 16 (1) or Article 16 (4)?

The majority bench of the high court in Pulusam was persuaded by the argument made by advocates K. Balagopal and others that the GO providing for 100% reservation was not made under 16 (4) which provides for reservations, but under 16 (1), which promises everyone an equal chance at state employment, and allows for reasonable classification in achieving this. Teaching posts in Scheduled areas, they argued, were a different category of jobs altogether – with different requirements and different objectives.

The SC, however, is categorical that reservation for Scheduled Tribes (as well as SCs and OBCs) is exhausted under 16 (4), and that 16 (1) is only for other classes not covered by 16 (4) though it is not clear who these other classes would be. In any case, we are told, without further explanation, “Assuming, for the sake of argument, it is to be a case of classification under Article 16(1), it would have been discriminatory and grossly arbitrary without rationale and violative of constitutional mandate.”

Original dwellers vs immigrants

Finally, we come to the fourth question which is at the heart of many contentious issues in the country today – how to balance the rights of immigrants and the rights of original dwellers. In the case of Assam, this has led to 19 lakh citizens being disenfranchised in the name of the updated National Register of Citizens; in Kashmir, however, the protection for domiciles embodied in Article 35 A was portrayed as illegitimate.

In the case of Scheduled Tribes, while commenting on the eligibility requirement for jobs, the Supreme Court does not appear to think the problem of demographic swamping by immigrants is an issue at all, nor does it concern itself with the rationale behind Scheduled areas in 1950: “The G.O. in question requires candidate or the parents to reside in the area continuously w.e.f. 26.1.1950 to date. There is no rhyme or reason to require continuous residence for last 50 years or more. It overlooks the rights of various other persons who might have settled decades together in the area in question… The same is fixed in highly unreasonable and arbitrary manner and limits zone of consideration to minuscule where an opportunity for public employment has to be afforded to all concerned with reasonable rights.” (para 147).

Judging by the continued over-representation of Hindu upper castes in gainful employment in this country, one might well say that the same has come to be fixed in a “highly unreasonable and arbitrary manner” and there is no rhyme or reason to the upper caste Hindu conviction that it is only they who have the natural right to rule over, provide justice to, or teach in this country, and that children of all other castes and religions must be grateful for the education and justice they get.

US Religious Freedom Monitor Recommends Designating India As 'Country Of Particular Concern',https://m.thewire.in/article/world/uscirf-religious-freedom-india-communal,"Apr 28, 2020  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: A US government body monitoring international religious freedom has recommended that the state department include India in the list of “countries of special concern,” joining a group of 13 other countries that include China, Pakistan, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Russia.

Unveiling the 2020 annual report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, the chairman of the bipartisan body said that overall, there had an improvement in the global environment on religious freedom, but it singled out India as having shown a “sharp downward turn” last year.

“Though other countries deteriorated, particularly India, we see international religious freedom on an upward trajectory overall,” said USCIRF chairman Tony Perkins.

Countries of Particular Concern in #USCIRFAnnualReport2020: Burma, China, Eritrea, India, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Vietnam — USCIRF (@USCIRF) April 28, 2020



This is the first time that USCIRF has proposed to include India in the special list since 2004.

Three out of the nine commissioners appended their dissent note in the annual report, expressing their opposition to the recommendation.

The recommendations of the Commission were to redesignate nine countries – Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan – in the list of “countries of special concern”. Besides, it proposed that five other countries, India, Nigeria, Russia, Syria, and Vietnam, should also join this group.

The commission’s annual report claimed that the Indian government “used its strengthened parliamentary majority to institute national-level policies violating religious freedom across India, especially for Muslims”.

The annual report pointed to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December 2019, which is supposed to provide fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. “According to the government officials’ statements, this law is meant to provide protection for listed non-Muslim religious communities — but not for Muslims — against exclusion from a nationwide National Register of Citizens and the resulting detention, deportation, and potential statelessness,” it said.

Further, the Commission noted that there was impunity for non-state actors in their violence against minorities. “The national and various state governments also allowed nationwide campaigns of harassment and violence against religious minorities to continue with impunity, and engaged in and tolerated hate speech and incitement to violence against them. Based on these developments, in this report USCIRF recommends CPC designation for India”.

The US government designates nations as “Countries of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, for having “engaged in or tolerated systematic, ongoing, [and] egregious violations of religious freedom”.

As per the Act, the recommendations of the Commission are taken in consideration when the US secretary of state will transmit to Congress an annual report on international religious freedom on May 1.

Besides designating India in the special list, the Commission also suggested targeted sanctions on government agencies and individuals, freezing their assets and barring their entry into the United States.

The annual report mentioned that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had pledged “revenge” against anti-CAA protesters.

On the issue of lynchings, the report observed that despite directions from the Supreme Court to enact stricter laws, home minister Amit Shah said that current legislation was sufficient. Shah had figured also in the report, over a line in which he called migrants “termites”.

The Commission also urged the US Congress to continue to hold hearings that highlight religious freedom conditions in India and US policy towards India.

However, at the end of the India chapter, “individual views” from three Commissioners were appended, expressing dissent against the decision to recommend India to the list.

In his dissent note, Gary L. Bauer, who had served in the Reagan White House, wrote that while he hoped that US raised concerns on restrictions on religious liberty with India at all fora, “I am deeply concerned that this public denunciation risks exactly the opposite outcome than the one we all desire”.

Bauer’s observations made it explicitly clear that he viewed India as a bulwark against “communist China”.

Outgoing Commissioner Tenzin Dorjee that while he was not oblivious to interreligious conflict, but added that “even during the violence over the CAA, Sikhs, Muslims, and Hindus protected each other’s homes and places of worship from mob violence and held interfaith ceremonies”

He added that as Tibetan refugees, “we enjoyed complete religious freedom in India that is non-existent in Tibet and China”.

“Recently, I was on a personal pilgrimage to major Buddhist holy sites in India and saw Hindus, Muslims, and other faiths enjoying religious freedom at their places of worship, shops, and homes. India and the United States are vital strategic partners. As I exit USCIRF as a Commissioner, I highly recommend constructive engagement among India, the U.S. government, and USCIRF to advance mutual interests including religious freedom and human rights.

Another Commissioner, Johnnie Moore said, “I am gravely concerned that political and inter-communal strife will be further exacerbated by religious tensions, yet I am also heartened that India remains the world’s largest democracy, governed by a pristine constitution, and I am also encouraged that this great nation is a tremendous friend and ally of the United States”.

Just like Dorjee, Moore, founder of a public relations consultancy, cited personal impressions during travel in India for not going with the majority. “It is a country I love because of its pluralism and because of the transformative impact it has had on my own life through my many visits (and visits to vibrantly religious places in Varanasi, Old Delhi, Amritsar, Dharamshala, Agra, Ajmer, Hyderabad, Kolkata, throughout Kerala, and many other places)”.

The response from the Indian government dismissed the report and highlighted the dissension within the Commission.

“We reject the observations on India in the USCIRF Annual Report. Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels. It has not been able to carry its own Commissioners in its endeavour. We regard it as an organisation of particular concern and will treat it accordingly,” said the MEA spokesperson.

Earlier this month, the USCIRF’s Twitter account had expressed concern about a media report that stated that Hindus and Muslim patients suffering from COVID-19 were being segregated in a Gujarat hospital. This report has been, so far, vehemently denied by the government.

In the official rebuttal, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava accused the Commission of adding “religious colour” to India’s fight against coronavirus. “As if its peremptory commentary on religious freedom in India is not enough, the USCIRF is now spreading misguided reports on the professional medical protocols followed to deal with spread of COVID19 in India,” he said on April 15."
How Hindutva Hatred is Jeopardising India’s Gulf Ties,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/hindutva-india-gulf-ties,"Apr 27, 2020  |  Talmiz Ahmad","In his six years as prime minister, Narendra Modi has expended more time, effort and commitment to cultivating ties with the Gulf region than any of his predecessors, and India’s initiatives have been fully reciprocated by his regional counterparts. These interactions have been assiduously promoted with frequent exchanges of visits, warm expressions of personal goodwill, even affection and several agreements to impart substance to the relationship in political, energy and economic areas.

Now, when the world is grappling with the extraordinary challenge posed by the coronavirus pandemic, relations shaped, elevated and solidified by the prime minister have been jeopardised – not by external rivals – but by cohorts from within his own ideological and political bandwagon, the Hindutva brigade. All of a sudden, tweets on social media and reports on mainstream television and newspaper columns are awash with harsh and angry exchanges between India’s Hindu nationalists and some sections of the Gulf’s elite – royal family members, business persons, professionals and human rights activists.

These tirades began innocuously enough: in an exchange between two Indians, a resident in the UAE, Saurabh Upadhyaya, who heads a consultancy firm, tweeted abusive messages about members of the Tablighi Jamaat; he, inter alia, referred to the Tablighis spitting on people as a “new form of jihad”. He ended his virulent message with: “Death to radical Islamic tabligi (sic) terrorists and other radical Islamic sons of satan.” To this he added some choice expletives in Romanised Hindi.

The war of tweets

Then, in a unique development in Gulf annals, a member of the Sharjah royal house, Sheikha Hend Al Qassemi responded to this tweet. Recalling her family’s close ties with India, the sheikha said: “… your rudeness is not welcome. … You make your bread and butter from this land which you scorn and your ridicule will not go unnoticed.” She then quoted UAE laws prohibiting hate speech by citizens and non-citizens.

In her later tweets, she listed the several public gatherings by Hindu pilgrims in different parts of India between March 9-19, which had attracted thousands of devotees, and placed the Tablighi congregation of 4,000 attendees within this broad context. She countered the aggressive Hindutva users of social media by reminding them that “Gandhi was a fearless campaigner for the rights and dignity of all people.” “He [Gandhi] won my heart”, she concluded, “and I believe in his peaceful approach to handling hatred.”

In an interview with an Indian television channel, Sheikha Hend was asked if she would similarly condemn “Hinduphobia”; she replied that in the UAE, “No one hates Hindus”.

﻿

This royal intervention has opened the floodgates to comments from other sources. An academic based in the US, specialising in Islamophobia, Khaled Beydoun, wrote in The New Arab about how the entire Indian Muslim community had been stigmatised for the transgressions of the Tablighis: they were being “scapegoated as disseminators of the novel virus in India”, through such appellations as “Corona jihad” and “Muslim virus”.

He said that Islamophobia in India was “state-sponsored”, and, referring to the communal riots in Delhi in February, held Prime Minister Modi responsible for the spread of “this pandemic violence”. He thought that this “novel strain of the Hindutva menace” was capitalising on “national anxiety” due to the global pandemic to demonise Muslims.

A religious scholar in Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Abidi Al Zahrani, called for the listing of “militant Hindus” in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries who were “spreading hate against Islam, Muslims or our beloved Prophet” under the hashtag “Send Hindutva Back Home”. In another tweet, he noted that millions of Indians lived in the Gulf and were treated free of charge if they were infected by the COVID-19 virus, “while Hindutva terrorist gangs are committing crimes against Muslim citizens”.

While #Hindutva #Terrorists gangs are committing crimes against #Muslims citizens — م/ عبيدي الزهراني (@ZahraniAbidi) April 12, 2020

Another Gulf resident, Preeti Giri, an executive director with a major local company, in her tweet told her followers that the actor Amir Khan belonged to the Tablighi Jamaat which was “Sunni, Hanafi ideology which was 99% Deobandi”; she exhorted them not to be so naïve as to “run after his films”. A prominent Emirati businesswoman, Noora al Ghurair, reprimanded Giri: “By your hateful logic Sunnis by association are terrorists because of propaganda against Muslims in India? Do U know [in] the country you live in all rulers are Sunnis? U want to boycott us?”

An academic of Indian orign, Ashok Swain of Sweden’s Uppsala University, wrote an opinion piece in Gulf News, Dubai, on April 22 in which he detailed how the pandemic had been deliberately communalised by Hindutva elements. He said: “Islamophobia has reached its peak in India with the increasing rise of coronavirus crisis. This is not just a primordial reaction of society, but a very well planned and finely executed political project.”

Noting the mis-steps of the government in handling the pandemic and the attendant serious economic crisis, Swain concluded:

“India’s Hindu nationalist regime aims to give the coronavirus crisis a communal colour, which will give it an escape route from its abject policy failures and also at the same time the increasing anti-Muslim environment will bring them political benefits in the coming elections in crucial states like Bihar. Coronavirus has brought a very serious crisis for India, but for the Narendra Modi regime, it has also provided a powerful political opportunity.”

Indian hate campaign bleeds into the Gulf

While these exchanges were on, tweets by the BJP member of parliament, Tejasvi Surya from 2015, quoting the self-styled Islamic “scholar” Tareq Fatah (who had been popular in Hindutva circles in India a few years ago) cropped up. The tweet said, “95% Arab women have never had an orgasm in the last few hundred years. Every mother has produced kids as act of sex and not love.”

This obviously was found most offensive. Noora Al Ghurair, a prominent businesswoman in Dubai, said: “Pity your upbringing that respect for women couldn’t be instilled in U despite India having some great female leaders.” She advised that, if he were to join the Indian foreign ministry in future, he “should avoid visiting Arab lands. You are not welcome here”.

A commentator from Kuwait, Abdul Rehman Nassar tweeted directly to Prime Minister Modi insisting that Tejasvi Surya be deprived of his parliamentary membership. He told the prime minister that Indians in Kuwait constitute the largest community among those infected with the coronavirus and were being treated in the best hospitals. He reminded Modi that Indians remitted billions of dollars to their country and all of them (mostly Hindu) were treated well in all Gulf countries. How are Muslims treated in India, he asked.

A Kuwaiti lawyer and human rights activist, Mejbal Al Sharika, also questioned Modi on the Surya tweet, pointing out that Surya had “publicly humiliate(d) our women” and demanding punitive action. He announced he was attaching himself, with other Gulf activists, to the cause of the Indian Muslims against “Hindutva fascism”.

On April 19, Modi intervened for the first time with a tweet.

COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together: PM @narendramodi — PMO India (@PMOIndia) April 19, 2020

Most observers would see these remarks as reflecting little conviction and less enthusiasm. In any case, they are likely to have no impact on his zealous followers. As Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay has pointed out in his article on April 24:

“… his [Modi’s] words … were posted on a platform which is primarily a business and employment-oriented service used for ‘networking’ by professionals.

“The vital question is, was this message intended for his supporters who have been fanning hatred towards Muslims or was it just to put it on record that the prime minister was opposed to religious profiling of coronavirus patients? Modi’s messaging is odd on two counts. One, if this is indeed aimed at signalling to the proverbial bhakts or blind supporters, Linkedin was not the appropriate platform to convey. Secondly, the smear campaign does not contend that the virus ‘chooses’ victims on basis of their religious identity and instead depicts Muslims as the chief and wilful carriers of the pandemic in the country.”

Why this intervention can be seen as half-hearted is because the hate campaign against Muslims on social media has been rampant within the country for a few years, but it has only now seriously entered Gulf consciousness, with Twitter traffic today consumed by the Hindutva narrative and Gulf nationals expressing their sentiments vociferously. This has also provided a great opportunity for Pakistani agencies to join the anti-India discussion with fake messaging, though, of course, their task is facilitated by the relentless abuse concocted and proliferated by Hindutva zealots.

Demonising Muslims by blaming the Tablighi congregation as being primarily responsible for the spread of the virus in India became central to the Hindutva narrative from late March itself, with mainstream Indian media an enthusiastic accomplice.

Figures from official sources were quoted to show how the Tablighis, returning home after their congregation in Delhi, had spread the disease. To this were added stories of their misbehaviour and misconduct – walking without trousers in hospital wards, making vulgar advances at nurses, throwing vegetarian food, defecating in wards, and deliberating spitting into food to spread the virus. These reports pandered to the traditional caricature of the Muslim in Hindutva lore – dirty, lascivious, uncouth and very malevolent and dangerous.

Senior political leaders publicly spoke of Muslims as “human bombs” and “enemies of humanity” – “Corona jihad” and “Muslim virus” have entered the national vocabulary and stayed in the mindset.

And, all of this was fake. Stories of Tablighi misconduct were later denied by officials, but without the vehemence and enthusiasm with which they had first emerged. The story of the figures of contamination by the Tablighis is even more interesting. Irena Akbar has explained how this was done; she has pointed out: “If many positive cases from March 29-30 onwards are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat, it’s because its members and their contacts are being rightly but selectively tested while the overall testing remains abysmally low.” She refers to this as “sampling bias”.

Recognising the need for more effective damage-control, external affairs minister S. Jaishankar personally intervened in the imbroglio: on April 23-24, he spoke to his counterparts in the UAE, Qatar, Oman and Saudi Arabia. According to press reports, he assured his interlocutors that India would continue to provide food supplies during the holy month of Ramadan and would make available the medicines required to fight the pandemic. Reports on television said he affirmed India would remain committed to its “Look West” policy.

India-Gulf relations

The Gulf countries have now for the first time woken up to the scourge of extremist Hindutva to which they had so far paid little attention. It will come as a surprise to Hindutva cadres that, despite periodic rhetoric, faith has hardly played any role in determining the direction and strength of the Gulf countries’ ties with India. Through the Cold War, the GCC countries were tied to Pakistan politically and militarily not because it was a Muslim country, but because they were allies on the same side of the global divide, their ties being cemented by their shared affiliation with the US.

After the Cold War, the Arab Gulf nations, united in the GCC, stretched out their hand to India when we had a BJP government led by Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee. The visit to Riyadh of external affairs minister Jaswant Singh in January 2001 marks the commencement of fresh political relations, symbolically strengthened by the gift of two Arabian horses to the Indian minister. Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, the son of Crown Prince Abdullah, told Jaswant Singh what his father had said to him: “I like the minister. He is honest; he is a Bedouin like us.”

Indo-Saudi strategic energy ties evolved to a “strategic partnership” after the Mumbai attack of November 2008 which had clearly revealed Pakistan as the nursery and sanctuary of extremist violence. This was enshrined in the “Riyadh Declaration” signed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz in February 2010.

Over the last six years, Prime Minister Modi has built on these foundations with a focus on taking these relations to new heights. These relations flow from the millennia-old engagements that India has had with West Asia. Every joint statement concluded during Modi’s interactions with Gulf leaders recalls the age-old civilisational links between India and the Gulf, as also their shared views and concerns relating to the regional security scenario.

Thus, the India-UAE joint statement of August 2015 noted the “centuries-old ties of commerce, culture and kinship” shared by India with the UAE, and then celebrated their modern-day partnership to help “realise the vision of an Asian Century”. In the joint statement with Saudi Arabia of April 2016, the two countries recognised “the close interlinkage of the stability and security of the Gulf region and the Indian sub-continent”. In the later joint statement of February 2019, India welcomed the “moderation and openness” being pursued by the Saudi crown prince in his country, while the latter appreciated “the Indian model of ethos of inclusiveness, pluralism and tolerance”.

The India-Oman statement of February 2018 noted “the historically close bilateral ties, involving vibrant maritime trade and cultural exchanges” that had been fostered by the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, and had opened opportunities for a “strategic partnership based on trust and mutual respect”.

The ties fostered during Modi’s prime ministership have gone beyond rhetoric to concrete deals. Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia have offered to make major investments in India, amounting to $70 billion and $100 billion, respectively, to develop India’s infrastructure and the energy and industrial sectors. Investments of a few billion dollars have already been made in specific projects.

The countries have also manifested their personal regard for the Indian prime minister by bestowing high awards upon him: the UAE conferred on him the “Order of Zayed”, its highest civilian award in August 2019; it had first announced the award in February, in the midst of the general elections, making clear its support for him. In August, he also received the “The King Hamad Order of the Renaissance”, Bahrain’s highest civilian award. Earlier, in April 2016, the Saudi ruler conferred on him its highest award, “The King Abdulaziz Sash”.

Historical links

Hindutva zealots, blinded by the religious binary, seem largely unfamiliar with the 5000-year heritage that has bonded the Indian and West Asian civilisations and peoples – an engagement that has been uninterrupted, has been rarely influenced by considerations of faith and has been constantly refreshed to impart contemporary value to the relationship.

There is archaeological evidence on the links of the Harappan civilisation with Bahrain and Oman, with India providing cereals, textiles and items of gracious living, items which dominate India’s export basket to this region even now. Later, India had close maritime ties with Assyria, Persia and Egypt, and, through Arab merchants, with the Roman empire. For 2000 years before the advent of Islam, Indian and Arab peoples lived for long periods in each other’s lands and were familiar with each other’s religion, culture, social norms and values and way of life.

After the advent of Islam, the Arabs first encountered India militarily with the invasion and occupation of Sindh in 718-800 AD. While this had little significance politically, its cultural impact was profound; Malik Mohammed says: “The Arabs … were astonished at the superiority of [India’s] civilisation. The sublimity of Indian philosophical ideas and the richness of the Indian intellect were a strange revelation to them.” (The Foundations of the Composite Culture in India, Aakar Books, 2007, p. 58.)

Ancient Indian works in the areas of medicine, astronomy and mathematics was translated from Sanskrit into Arabic. These included: Arthashastra, Sidhandha Charaka Samhitha and the Panchatantra. In the reign of the Abbasid caliph Mamoon (813-33 AD), the mathematician Al Khwarizmi (780-840) adapted Sanskrit numerals into Arabic mathematics.

Arabs came to southern India as merchants and travellers and were warmly welcomed by local rulers. The Arab traveller Ibn Batuta (1304-77), during his travels along India’s western coast, saw several Muslims from Persia and Yemen living in prosperous conditions.

Between the 8th and 15th centuries there were considerable cross-religious influences, particularly with the initiation of reform movements by Vaishnava and Shaivite saints. The scholar Dr Tarachand has written: “[It was in the south where] Islam came into contact with Hinduism and leavened the growing mass of Hindu thought.”

This was reflected in the thinking and speculations of sages such as Ramanuja, Vishnuswami, Madhava and Nimbarka in the 12th and 13th centuries whose thought reflected a “closer parallelism” with Islam. Tarachand notes the following influences from Sufism: emphasis on monotheism; emotional worship; self-surrender (prapatti) and veneration of the teacher (guru-bhakti); loosening of the caste system, and indifference to mere ritualism.

Indian communities have been resident in the Gulf for at least the last millennium; there are records of Indians from Kutch residing in Muscat for the last 600 years. From the 15th century, it had colonies of Bhatias from Thatta, who were later followed by Kutchi Bhatias and Khojas from Sindh, known in Oman as Lawatis. A Kutchi merchant, Narottam, is believed to have supported an Omani uprising against the Portuguese in 1649; his descendants are honoured in Oman to this day.

In 1765, the Dutch explorer Carsten Niebuhr wrote of Muscat thus:

“In no other Mahometan city are the Indians so numerous as in Muscat; their number in the city is no less than 1200. They are permitted to live agreeable to their own laws, to bring their wives hither, and to set up idols in their chambers, and to burn their dead.”

The Gulf communities imported foodstuffs, textiles, wood and metal from India, while Indians imported horses and pearls which were then made into jewellery and sold globally. The Indian rupee was used in the Gulf from the 16th century up to the 1960s. Today, in Oman, about a hundred Kutchi families have Omani nationality; they are headed by their own “Sheikh”, Kanakbhai Khimji.

As the British consolidated their political power over the Gulf from the early 19th century, the administration was entirely manned, financed and controlled from India. Resident Indian communities flourished as business persons, professionals, technicians, government officials and skilled workers. James Onley has in fact argued that the Gulf constituted the outer edge of the British Indian empire:

“For over 4000 years, Arabia fell within the economic and cultural orbit of India. During the British rule, it also fell within the political orbit of India. Between 1820 and 1947, its political affairs were dominated by the East India Company and its successor, the British Government of India. Arabia was the western-most frontier of the British Indian Empire.”

India had a tremendous influence on the cultural life of people in the Gulf in terms of local architecture, clothing and cuisine. Gulf Arabs enjoy Indian curried lamb, biryani and seekh kabab and even the humble samosa is a delicacy to this day; the Indian “kadak chai” is an addiction. The Gulf countries are the main markets for India’s basmati rice.

With the influx of oil revenues, the Gulf went truly global – now major international corporations came to the region to execute high-value infrastructure, energy and manufacturing projects. India again rose to the challenge – it soon became the principal source of manpower to execute the projects. Commencing with just a million in the early 1980s, the Indian community expanded to three and a half million by 2000, six million by 2010 and now stands at over eight million. This community remits about $35 billion to India annually.

Indians are the largest expatriate community in every country of the Gulf and are the majority in three countries – the UAE, Bahrain and Qatar. The profile of the community has also changed: in 1990, it was 90% blue-collar; today, though six times larger, it is just about 65-70% blue-collar, with at least 20% being professionals – engineers, doctors, managers and accountants. Hundreds of Indian chartered accountants hold distinguished positions in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Oman and dominate the upper levels of the financial sector.

The last few decades have witnessed the emergence of entrepreneurs from within the community, from small business persons to tycoons of international standing in the areas of health, construction, education, infrastructure, finance and retail services.

Over the last 20 years, India has become a major importer of hydrocarbons from the Gulf – 50% of its imported oil and gas comes from the GCC. The GCC countries collectively are among the top three of India’s trading partners in terms of blocs, while two GCC countries – the UAE and Saudi Arabia – are in the top five of India’s trade partners. The UAE is also India’s number two export destination, after the US. Even as GCC countries have increased their investments in India, Indian corporations too have expanded their presence in the region in the infrastructure and energy sectors.

The Gulf countries – with the exception of Saudi Arabia – have not attached any significance to faith in the public domain; they have recruited people and given them opportunity without regard to their belief. Thus, the UAE has over a hundred nationalities, with Indians being about 55% of the total. All GCC countries, except Saudi Arabia, have temples and churches as well as burial and cremation grounds for non-Muslims.

Even in Saudi Arabia, which is founded on an affiliation with the narrow and rigid Wahhabi doctrine, faith has generally been an instrument for the assertion of political authority rather than reflecting a serious commitment to belief. On the one occasion when the kingdom banned the recruitment of Sikhs in the early 1980s (which was quickly reversed under diplomatic pressure), there has never been any bias in favour of Muslims in local employment. Hence, reflecting India’s population, the majority of Indians in the Gulf in different categories, including the tycoons, are non-Muslims.

Outlook for ties

At this point, it would be useful to place the recent acrimony in perspective. There has been no comment from GCC official sources. All told, there have been only a few hate messages from Indians resident in the Gulf. From the GCC side, the responses have been few and restrained: anger has been directed at specific sources of the tweets and collectively only against extremist Hindutva elements. There has not been a generalised critique of India; unlike the Hindutva messages, there has been no communal content in the GCC tweets. In fact, the GCC responses have expressed anguish at what they see as the betrayal of India’s time-honoured values – accommodation, moderation, respect for women, etc.

This is not surprising. The Gulf communities have never viewed India through a communal prism, only in the framework of India’s core principles – democracy, secularism and pluralism in a multi-cultural society. India is seen as unique among developing countries in that: it is a democracy; it is a secular and pluralistic society, where both personal law and civil codes co-exist, the latter even providing for cross-communal marriages; it has a free press and an independent judiciary; and, within this framework of democracy and pluralism, it has made great strides in economic and technological achievement.

It will surprise India’s zealots to learn that the Indian “model” has evoked extraordinary respect and admiration across the region over the last several decades.

It is not as if the region did not know of the periodic communal conflagrations in India; but these were viewed as aberrations in a large and diverse nation. Thus, there were no public criticisms of India from official sources after the destruction of Babri Masjid and the subsequent riots.

When this writer, as Indian ambassador to Saudi Arabia in 2002, attempted, under government instructions, to explain the post-Godhra violence to a senior Saudi minister and royal family member, the latter said no explanation was called for; this was an exceptional episode. Saudi Arabia had full confidence in India’s commitment to its essential values of pluralism and accommodation of all its diverse communities.

Still, there is no room for complacency. The hate messages that proliferated in the Gulf did not originate in the region; they were churned out in India where a hate industry is in full swing, disseminating fake news and abuse through hundreds of messages on social media that are then enthusiastically and mindlessly repeated by its cohorts. What the recent exchanges have done is to expose Hindutva in its full nakedness and ugliness to the Gulf public. It has planted the first concerns that India might no longer be shaped by its traditional values, that the India they knew and cherished is perhaps withering away before their very eyes.

Will this impact on India’s political and economic ties with the region and the continued recruitment of its people? Perhaps not in the immediate future. The region’s rulers are objective and hard-headed in understanding their interests – they know that India will continue to need their energy resources and they will continue to need India’s manpower. Certainly, there is no other nationality that can substitute for the skill, the discipline and the apolitical character of the Indian. In their recent personal interactions with the region’s leaders both Modi and Jaishankar have played on these realities.

But, while the rulers do not permit religiosity in the public space for political purposes, the pervasive society is still Muslim. And, whatever the wishes of the rulers, Islam, generally projected as “moderate”, remains a force in the region’s political order. Saudi Arabia uses its guardianship of the two holy mosques of Mecca and Madinah to promote its leadership of the global Muslim community. Qatar is firmly anchored in political Islam. It has affiliated itself with Turkey and Iran and regional Islamist movements to promote its interests on this basis. Kuwait has a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party that is influential in domestic politics.

The UAE prides itself as an exponent of moderate and “enlightened Islam”, but Islam remains an important factor in its foreign policy. As Giorgio Cafiero has noted:

“In what is called the ‘geopolitics of religious soft power,’ the UAE utilizes Islam to strengthen its regime’s legitimacy, compete with rival states’ visions for Islamic leadership, and project an image of moderation and tolerance before global actors, namely Western countries. Along with Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco, the UAE has sought to present itself as a purveyor of “moderate Islam” that stands firmly against extremism.”

Unquestionably, domestic considerations heavily influence the UAE’s use of Islam in its foreign policy. At the heart of the Emiratis’ reasons for utilising religion in this manner is the Abu Dhabi regime’s fears of political Islam fuelling change in the Emirates.

Now that the region has been made familiar with the ideology, agenda and aggression of Hindutva adherents, it is difficult to believe we can go back to business-as-usual. Can Modi’s persona continue to radiate across the Gulf’s firmament while the Muslim community at home is being demonised, abused and violated? The challenge before Modi and his colleagues is to sincerely and robustly confront the hate and abuse being spewed by their cadres at home that are then impacting attitudes and mind-sets in the Gulf and are jeopardising the centuries-old ties we have enjoyed with this region.

There is a sharp warning coming in from the Gulf – alongside several other sources. But are there listeners in Delhi?

Will India's Snooping State Survive Judicial Scrutiny?,https://m.thewire.in/article/government/india-snooping-state-judicial-scrutiny,"Dec 26, 2018  |  Agnidipto Tarafder","Last week, a directive from India’s ministry of home affairs (MHA) authorised ten government agencies to intercept any communication from any electronic device, including computers, and mobile phones, when investigating matters of national importance.

Opposition leaders cried foul, alleging privacy violation and the creation of a surveillance state, but the government staunchly defended the measure as vital for national security.

For any regular observer of Indian politics, the one certainty in this debate is that the directive will face a constitutional challenge before long. The question is, will it survive judicial scrutiny?

A circular by a ministry is an executive order, which satisfies the definition of ‘law’ as per Article 13 of the Constitution. This also states that any law in contravention of the fundamental rights is void and may be struck down by the High Courts and Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court in its recent judgments on the Right to Privacy and Aadhaar has established the twin tests of ‘necessity’ and ‘proportionality’ as the touchstones for judging such measures. A plain reading of the MHA circular suggests that it fails on both these counts.

Not only does it create a platform for mass surveillance by the government, but by alluding to national security, it plays up a prevailing anxiety among the public to justify this disproportionate power.

‘Big Brother is watching’

Clichéd as it may sound, this move by the MHA has the flavor of an Orwellian dystopia. The over-broad language of the circular presents a possibility for collecting and utilizing sensitive personal information on an unprecedented scale. The circular refers to ‘information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer’. Without any qualifiers attached, this enables the agencies to access the contents of every computer, phone or like device that is being operated in the country.

The circular states ‘interception, monitoring and decryption’ as its purpose. This implies that intelligence gathered by these agencies may be used for any purpose whatsoever; so long it fits into the broad understanding of ‘monitoring’.

This may be the most worrisome aspect of the circular, especially due to the absence of a Data Protection Act. The ideas of collection limitation and use specification do not flow naturally from existing laws. Collecting data beyond the requisite amount or purpose specified, and profiling individuals or groups based on such interception, are certainly not beyond the realm of possibility.

The national security justification

The justification of national security has been the favored arrow in the quiver of the investigative agencies in surveillance cases across the world. Courts have traditionally deferred to the executive’s prerogative whenever the National Security argument is introduced. The Court’s reluctance in striking down national security laws in the backdrop of rising terrorism is perhaps understandable, since it may feel that denuding the security agencies of their powers makes the Court indirectly responsible for acts of extremism to follow.

While the MHA order will no doubt aid the security agencies in their investigative capacities, what remains unclear, even apart from fears of misuse, is how much actual security such a measure would provide? Noted scholars such as Jennifer Chandler argue that heightened surveillance often leads to less rather than more security, since these measures have been known to disproportionately affect racial and religious minorities, based on profiling along those lines. These measures that seem to increase a feeling of security but don’t translate to an actual increase in physical safety create a condition described as a ‘security theatre’, where the mental aspect of ‘feeling secure’ is given greater importance than physical safety.

More than what meets the eye?

Curiously, while the rhetoric from the government harps on national security, Section 69 of the Information Technology Act has a far wider import. A direction issued under the section includes interception for the purposes of investigation of offences and preventing incitement to offences.

The current directive enlists agencies such as the Narcotics Control Bureau and Central Board of Direct Taxes, which seems to suggest that these powers may be utilized for the detection of financial and narcotics related offences as well. This contradicts the government claim that these powers are reserved for exceptional cases, especially those relating to national security.

Existing safeguards provide little consolation. The government claims that due process will be observed, since the agencies may only intercept data after approval from the home secretary. But without judicial oversight or need for warrants, the government will be the judge in its own cause; the executive and its officials will be in charge of the entire operation, including deciding its necessity and scope.

If data is the new oil, the central government is certainly its new baron. The MHA directive is part of the government’s continuous and concerted efforts to obtain greater volumes of citizen’s data. In the case of Aadhaar, data was collected under the pretext of greater transparency for welfare schemes; in this case, the pretext is national security.

The overbroad language, the excessive delegation of powers and the lack of meaningful accountability in the circular could be a potent weapon in the hands of the data handlers. Only the naïve would dismiss the possibility of misuse.

In the era of targeting dissident voices by branding them ‘Urban Naxals’, based on unclear evidence purportedly obtained from personal computers, this decision could be ominous.

"Sweden, India Agree to Strengthen Cooperation on Defence",https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/sweden-india-agree-to-strengthen-cooperation-on-defence,"Apr 18, 2018  |  Reuters","Stockholm: Sweden and India will strengthen their cooperation on defence, their prime ministers said on Tuesday, a move that could aid Sweden’s Saab in its bid to sell its Gripen jet to replace India’s Soviet-era MiG fighters.

Last week, India issued a request for information for 110 combat jets for the air force, marking the first step toward a long-delayed deal that could be worth more than $15 billion.

“Sweden and India have agreed to work towards a security agreement allowing us to exchange certain types of classified information required to work together on defence materials,” Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told reporters after meeting his Indian counterpart in Stockholm.

“This agreement would be an important step forward to deepen our bilateral cooperation in the defence domain.”

Lockheed Martin, Saab and Dassault Aviation are among the manufacturers expected to compete for India’s fighter order. The planes must be largely built locally as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s make-in-India drive to build a domestic industrial base.

“In the area of defence, Sweden has been a partner of India for a very long time and I am sure that in the future as well, we will find more opportunities for cooperation, in particular in the area of defence production,” Modi told reporters.

Saab had agreed to work with India’s Adani Group in a bid to sell single-engine planes to the air force, but India has since widened the brief to both single and twin-engined planes.

The two countries also agreed to cooperate on renewable energy, urban transport and waste management."

"Zika Virus's Effects Getting Clearer, But Not on Why it's Not Struck in India Yet",https://m.thewire.in/article/health/zika-viruss-effects-getting-clearer-but-not-on-why-its-not-struck-in-india-yet,"Jun 29, 2016  |  Raghavi Rao Kodati","As the 2016 Olympic games are a little more than a month away, to be held in Zika-prone Brazil, what do we know about the virus and its effects?

In February this year, the WHO had declared the outbreak of microcephaly cases in Latin America and the Carribean as a public health emergency of international concern. The Zika virus was then presumed to be just one potential cause of this outbreak. However, studies in the period elapsed since then have strongly ascertained a correlation between Zika and microcephaly, the condition in which infants are born with abnormally small heads. In fact, not just to microcephaly but also to ailments of the nervous system like the rare Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) or encephalitis, where the immune system attacks the nervous system.

The indication of this strong correlation has prompted the WHO to declare Zika virus itself as the public health emergency and target measures against the virus. These developments were announced in the WHO’s Emergency Committee meeting held on June 14, 2016. This move was an outcome of strong evidence put together by the large amount of clinical data and laboratory research pouring in from across the world. The body of scientific work tackling Zika has been growing and now focuses on various aspects of the disease: from causality, spread, diagnostics to prevention and infection management. These developments have been made available on the Zika Research Projects List and Zika Open, open access sites being maintained by Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) and the WHO to share developments in the field and ensure speedy dissemination of information.

Zika enters China but not India. Yet.

A person returning from Venezuela early this year has been reported to be afflicted with the first case of zika virus disease in mainland China, as reported by this Chinese journal. Another study study suggests that at least three such cases of infected travellers have been reported in the country so far and have been cured. There have been no incidents of local transmission though, as is evident in China’s absence in the WHO list of 60 countries that have showed widespread or sporadic locally transmitted cases of Zika.

India, on the other hand, has remained free of any cases since the outbreak, although the reasons for this are not clear. A University of Oxford study in April indicated that tropical climate zones like that of India have suitable environmental conditions for the spread of Zika. The authors however reasoned the lack of reported cases to be either due to “under-reporting, misdiagnosis, or high level of immunity in the human population”. The presence of a virus for a long time in Asian and African geographies could have potentially resulted in widespread immunisation.

Despite the WHO’s public health emergency status, significant money has not been pumped into Zika research in India in the face of a lack of seemingly imminent threat. However, as this report by the Economic Times quotes, the Indian Council for Medical Research is continuing its screening for Zika in cases that test negative for its close cousins, dengue and chikungunya.

Zika affects the eyes, too

The Zika virus usually cause a mild disease that goes unreported in at least 80% of the cases due to a lack of visible symptoms. Some affected may show a mild course of disease that includes fever, rashes and conjunctivitis. Diseases and fatalities like GBS and encephalitis are still rare among adults. Most complications of Zika occur in infants, causing microcephaly and affecting other parts of the central nervous system. A recent study published in the US’ National Institute of Health repository has shown the additional possible association of ocular impairments with microcephaly and Zika in infants. The reported conditions included pigment mottling and chorioretinal atrophy, a condition in which the retina of the eye and its associated nerve and blood vessel layer, called choroid, degenerate.

Molecular epidemiology

In any epidemic, it is crucial to understand the evolution of the virus’ molecular structure in order to predict and contain its future course of spread. A study in 2012, much before the outbreak, identified two lineages of the virus: Asian and African. A recent study building upon that has established that the virus currently circulating in the Americas is that of the Asian lineage, hinting that the virus could have travelled from southeast Asia to Brazil, possibly mutating and becoming virulent in the process.

An Indian group, headed by Dr. Sujatha Sunil at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biology in New Delhi, worked on comparing these virulent strains of Zika to the mellow old strains and identifying the mutation that might have been responsible for the outbreak. Their computational study indicated several changes in the genomic structure in the new strains. However, further experimental work will be needed to positively establish their correlation with the outbreak.

Olympics, vaccines and diagnostics

In the June 14 announcement, WHO presented data to assess the risk of an outbreak at the Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Zika-prone Brazil from August. Considering that at least 20% of the world’s population already lives in Zika-affected areas and that 30% of international air travel is to these areas, Bruce Aylward, the executive director of the Outbreaks and Health Emergencies department at WHO, concluded that the Olympics does not significantly alter these patterns. Further, given the nature of the gathering, there is no additional risk. He added that with enough surveillance and awareness, the risk of spread of the virus is minimal. Additionally, the onset of winter in the southern hemisphere during the games should also help limit any spread.

The WHO also announced that nearly 30 companies were making diagnostic devices for Zika and about four countries, including India, are developing vaccines. While the diagnostic devices may come out soon enough, the timeline for vaccine development is rather long as it includes animal and human trials over and above the initial research phase. But there is some good news.

“The close similarity of Zika with dengue and chikungunya means that the vaccine development process could be much shorter”, says Dr. Sunil, whose computational study on Zika strains was mentioned earlier. The three viruses, especially dengue and Zika, show great morphological and genomic similarities between themselves. The vaccine development for Zika can hence draw on the vaccine research for the other two. Bharat Biotech, the India company developing ZIKAVAC, a candidate Zika vaccine, was unavailable for comments on the progress of their animal trials."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi used strong words at The Economic Times’s Global Business Summit last Friday when he said the system will not accept “the theft of public money. That is the key to the new economy and new rules”.

At the same summit, finance minister Arun Jaitley also lamented that regularly occurring bank scams cannot help the economy and India Inc grow smoothly.

The front rows of the audience were occupied by some of the biggest business promoters of India and the sheer irony of the Modi’s assertion would not have been lost on them.

The most poorly kept secret of business operations in India – which is also the main cause of bank scams and wilful loan defaults by businesses – is that promoters greatly inflate project costs against which they access bigger bank loans. A good part of this money is used to build the personal wealth of promoters and to fund political parties. So has this changed in the “new India with new rules”? Going by the current scenario, very little has changed. Scams perpetrated by over-invoicing continue unabated.

The very start of a business, as seen in the case of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi’s modus operandi, is premised on a falsehood. The former managing director of Gitanjali Gems Ltd, Santosh Srivastav, who had resigned many years ago, told NDTV that the account books showed gems and diamonds worth over Rs 7,000 crore but physically the company had no more than Rs 200 crore worth of stocks. It is against such exaggerated inventories and receivables that the company likely get increased credit from banks. Srivastav says when he brought this to the notice of Choksi, he was told to mind his own business and look after the retail operations which he was heading then. Srivastav says he resigned soon thereafter.

So whether it is the diamond business or some big infrastructure project, the modus operandi remains the same – inflate the project cost and get the banks and taxpayers to foot the bill.

Gajendra Haldea who, as special secretary in the Planning Commission, specialised in drafting public-private partnership agreements (PPA) in infrastructure sectors during the UPA regime, once told me that all projects whether in roads, power or airports had resorted to inflated capital costs and it was a huge task to design PPA agreements with built-in clauses to counter such manipulations.

The community of chartered accountants and regulators, whom Jaitley now blames for not detecting such manipulations in time, knew all along that promoters inflated project costs in a manner that provided not only their debt component but also paid for the promoter’s equity.

Red flags over Nirav Modi’s firm shines spotlight on rampant over-invoicing in India’s diamond trade

For instance, if the actual cost of a power project is Rs 100, it would be shown as Rs 150 to the banks. A consortium of banks then would lend Rs 100 to the company based on a normal debt to equity ratio of 2:1. So on an inflated project cost of Rs 150, the promoter manages to get a loan of Rs 100 which actually pays for both the debt and the promoter’s equity in the actual project cost of Rs 100. This has been the standard operating procedure for shady projects during the UPA governments and now as well in “New India”.

Therefore, the finance minister cannot possibly pretend that this is not happening in the “New India” that Modi so fondly talks about. Jaitley has said the auditors and regulators must take responsibility for not detecting such manipulations early enough and has also lamented that only the political class gets the blame for it.

The political class is very much part of this game as inflated and over-invoiced imports by big businesses are used to launder money to political parties.

As we sit and debate these issues in light of the Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi scam, the finance ministry has appealed strongly in the customs appellate tribunal for the re-examination of a case of alleged over-invoicing of power equipment imports to the tune of nearly Rs 4,000 crore against the Adani Group.

There are other leading business houses too against whom the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has fully investigated reports of over-invoicing. There are two public interest litigations in the Delhi high court pertaining to the same cases of over-invoicing. At least in these cases, Jaitley can’t complain about failure on the part of the regulators or investigators to detect the alleged manipulations. These companies are also among the top borrowers from Indian banks and if a default by them occurs in the future it cannot be categorised as natural defaults owing to business risk until they are cleared in the cases of over-invoicing of imports. If these cases are proved, then their loan defaults will have to be categorised as ‘wilful’ and regulators must put a lien on their personal wealth.

Over-invoicing of imports, if proven, is tantamount to illegal diversion of borrowed bank funds. Therefore, it must be treated as wilful default. So far all cases of wilful default listed by the RBI are largely medium-sized businesses such as Rotomac Pens, Kingfisher Airlines and so on.

It is a surprise that there are no wilful defaulters yet among the top 20 big business houses that owe money to banks and have also defaulted in many instances.

It is evident that the big business groups somehow manage to keep themselves out of the wilful defaulters’ list and avoid a situation where a claim is made on their personal assets. This clout, Mr Jaitley, comes from their proximity to the political class and not regulators.

When many of these highly indebted big business honchos travel with the prime minister on his foreign jaunts, the regulators and investigators get mixed signals.

So, blaming regulators is valid but simply not good enough. The fish, as they say, starts rotting from the head."

"Spyware Firms Make Beeline for India, Products to Track COVID-19 Patients Raise Privacy Concerns",https://m.thewire.in/article/tech/spyware-delhi-police-covid-19-quarantine,"Apr 29, 2020  |  Joel Schectman, Christopher Bing and Jack Stubbs","Washington: When law enforcement agencies want to gather evidence locked inside an iPhone, they often turn to hacking software from the Israeli firm Cellebrite. By manually plugging the software into a suspect’s phone, police can break in and determine where the person has gone and whom he or she has met.

Now, as governments fight the spread of COVID-19, Cellebrite is pitching the same capability to help authorities learn who a coronavirus sufferer may have infected. When someone tests positive, authorities can siphon up the patient’s location data and contacts, making it easy to “quarantine the right people,” according to a Cellebrite email pitch to the Delhi police force this month.

This would usually be done with consent, the email said. But in legally justified cases, such as when a patient violates a law against public gatherings, police could use the tools to break into a confiscated device, Cellebrite advised. “We do not need the phone passcode to collect the data,” the salesman wrote to a senior officer in an April 22 email reviewed by Reuters.

A Cellebrite spokeswoman said the salesman was offering the same tools the company has long sold to help police enforce the law. The company is also offering a version of its product line for use by healthcare workers to trace the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, but the tools can only be used with patient consent and can’t hack phones, she said.

Cellebrite’s marketing overtures are part of a wave of efforts by at least eight surveillance and cyber-intelligence companies attempting to sell repurposed spy and law enforcement tools to track the virus and enforce quarantines, according to interviews with executives and non-public company promotional materials reviewed by Reuters.

The executives declined to specify which countries have purchased their surveillance products, citing confidentiality agreements with governments. But executives at four of the companies said they are piloting or in the process of installing products to counter coronavirus in more than a dozen countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia. A Delhi police spokesman said the force wasn’t using Cellebrite for coronavirus containment. Reuters is not aware of any purchases by the US government.

So far, Israel is the only country known to be testing a mass surveillance system pitched by the companies, asking NSO Group, one of the industry’s biggest players, to help build its platform. But the rollout of NSO’s surveillance project with the Israeli Ministry of Defense is on hold pending legal challenges related to privacy issues, an NSO executive said. A spokesman for Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett said NSO was involved in the project but did not provide further details.

Surveillance-tech companies have flourished in recent years as law enforcement and spy agencies around the world have sought new methods for countering adversaries who now often communicate through encrypted mobile apps. The firms argue that their experience helping governments track shadowy networks of militants makes them uniquely qualified to uncover the silent spread of a novel disease.

“I really believe this industry is doing more good than bad,” said Tal Dilian, a former Israeli intelligence officer and now a co-chief executive officer of Cyprus-based Intellexa, a cyber-surveillance firm that works with intelligence agencies in Southeast Asia and Europe. “Now is a good time to show that to the world.”

Yet some technologists remain skeptical that spying tools reliant on phone location data can be used to effectively combat a virus.

“It’s not precise enough, that’s the point. It’s not nearly going to get you down to whether you’re next to a certain person or not,” said Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at University College London.

While the methods for location tracking and accuracy vary, surveillance companies say they can narrow down a person’s coordinates to within three feet, depending on conditions.

Privacy rights versus health concerns

Privacy issues loom. Civil liberties advocates fear that virus tracking efforts could open the door to the kind of ubiquitous government surveillance efforts they have fought for decades. Some are alarmed by the potential role of spyware firms, arguing their involvement could undermine the public trust governments need to restrain the spread of the virus.

“This public health crisis needs a public health solution – not the interjection of for-profit surveillance companies looking to exploit this crisis,” said Edin Omanovic, advocacy director for the UK-based civil liberties group Privacy International.

Claudio Guarnieri, a technologist with the human rights organisation Amnesty International, said any new surveillance powers embraced by states to combat the virus should be met with “high scrutiny.”

“New systems of control, from location tracking to contact tracing, all raise different concerns on necessity and proportionality,” said Guarnieri.

Cellebrite, for one, said it requires “agencies that use our solutions to uphold the standards of international human rights law.”

Government officials have sought to address such concerns by pointing to the unprecedented nature of the crisis. COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, has so far infected more than 3 million people worldwide, killing over 210,000.

In South Africa, for example, after the government last month announced it would use telecom data to track the movements of citizens infected with COVID-19, a communications minister acknowledged concerns about loss of privacy.

“We do respect that everyone has a right to privacy, but in a situation like this our individual rights do not supersede the country’s rights,” Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, the communications minister, said at a press conference for South Africa’s COVID-19 command council this month.

The South African Health Ministry declined to comment on details of the program and whether it had contracted with any of the intelligence firms.

A number of countries are developing and deploying COVID-19 contact-tracing apps that do not rely on location data. Instead, these apps, already in use in Singapore, India and Colombia, tap the smartphone connectivity technology Bluetooth to sense and record when other devices are nearby. When someone tests positive for coronavirus, typically, everyone that person made contact with is notified.

Christophe Fraser, an epidemiologist at Oxford University’s Big Data Institute, said this approach, if implemented properly, could save lives and shorten lockdowns. “The idea is to try and maximize social distancing practices of those at risk of infection and minimise the impact on all the other people,” he said.

This app-based approach to contact tracing is considered, by its advocates, as more privacy friendly because people voluntarily download the app and sensitive personal data are visible only to health authorities. This method of containing the disease is the focus of a rare collaboration between Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google to quickly deploy the Bluetooth-based technology for use in the United States and elsewhere. But the approach relies on widespread adoption of the apps, and its accuracy remains unproven.

Apple says its plan is designed to “help amplify the efforts of the public health authorities” and that “many factors will help flatten [infection] curves — no one believes this is the only one.” A Google spokesman referred to a prior statement, which said “each user will have to make an explicit choice to turn on the technology.”

By contrast, deploying a mass surveillance platform like Intellexa’s means everyone would be under collection right away; no one needs to opt in, nor could anyone opt out. Such a setup can be done remotely in a matter of weeks, said an executive at NSO Group, which is also offering its wares to fight the coronavirus.

Public health spy tech

The surging spyware business is estimated by research firm MarketsandMarkets to be worth $3.6 billion this year.

But the industry has been dogged by legal and ethical concerns. Human rights groups have accused some companies of helping undemocratic governments target dissidents and activists. The companies say they help governments prevent terrorism and capture criminals.

Last year, for example, Facebook’s WhatsApp unit accused NSO Group of helping governments hack 1,400 targets that included activists, journalists, diplomats and state officials. NSO denies the allegations, saying it only provides the technology to government agencies under strict controls and is not involved in operations.

Intellexa’s Dilian fled Cyprus last year after an arrest warrant was issued for him, on accusations that he used a surveillance van to illegally intercept communications in the country. Dilian denies the allegations, returned to Cyprus last month and said he is cooperating with authorities. A Cypriot police spokesman told Reuters the investigation is active.

Now, industry executives, investors and analysts say the coronavirus crisis offers intelligence firms the possibility of billions of dollars in business, while burnishing their reputations.

India is among the courted countries. In April, New York-based Verint Systems asked Indian officials to pay $5 million for a year’s subscription to a host of services designed to track and surveil people with coronavirus. Those included a cellphone tower geolocation platform and a program to monitor social media activity, according to documents seen by Reuters and a person with knowledge of the negotiations. No sale has yet been agreed in India, the source said.

A Verint spokesman declined to answer questions, instead referring to an April 16 press release which said unspecified products were being used by an unnamed country to help respond to COVID-19. India’s Ministry of Interior said it had not purchased a system from Verint.

NSO Group and Intellexa are also both pitching COVID-19 tracking platforms to countries across Asia, Latin America and Europe. Their technology could allow a government to track the movement of nearly every person in the country who carries a cellphone, sucking up a continuous trove of location data. Installed within telecom providers, the technology functions through the analysis of call records, said NSO and Intellexa executives.

When a person tests positive, the systems would allow authorities to input the result, tracking those who made contact with the patient in the past few weeks. Those exposed would receive a text message encouraging them to get tested or self-isolate. NSO said the system’s administrators would not see the identity of individuals.

Revelations in 2013 that the US National Security Agency had collected this kind of mobile phone data about Americans to track national security threats created a storm of controversy and fuelled new restrictions on surveillance.

Suzanne Spaulding, a former US intelligence community lawyer and senior Homeland Security official, described this potential COVID-19 tracking approach as “among the most privacy-invasive.” That’s because it “envisions all of the data about everyone’s movements, not just infected individuals and their known contacts, going to the government.”

South Korea, Pakistan, Ecuador and South Africa have all indicated in public statements they were rolling out contact tracing systems using telecom data to track infected citizens, though the details haven’t been released.

South Korean officials say any loss of privacy from surveillance must be weighed against the disastrous economic consequences caused from a long-term shutdown.

“It is also a restriction of freedom when you ban free movement of people in crisis,” Jung Seung-soo, a deputy director at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, told Reuters. The country is not using outside surveillance vendors, the official said.

Intellexa is in the process of installing its system in two Western European countries, Dilian said. He declined to name them.

In an interview with Reuters, NSO employees responsible for the product said the company is piloting the approach in 10 countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, but declined to name them.

Three other Israeli companies, Rayzone Group, Cobwebs Technologies and Patternz, are offering countries coronavirus tracking capabilities. These largely rely on location data gathered from mobile advertising platforms, according to company promotional documents reviewed by Reuters and people familiar with the companies.

Rayzone Group declined to comment. Requests for comment to Patternz went unanswered. Omri Timianker, president and co-founder of Cobwebs Technologies, said his company is working with five governments to help track the spread of the virus, but declined to identify them.

While some experts say advertising data isn’t precise enough to combat the spread of COVID-19, the documents reviewed by Reuters suggest the three firms are marketing technology which they contend can ingest and process advertising data into a form that’s useful for narrowly tracking individuals.

Intellexa’s Dilian said his company’s platform will cost between $9 million and $16 million for countries with large populations. He believes COVID-19 tracking will be just the beginning. Once the pandemic ends, he hopes countries that invested in his mass surveillance tool will adapt it for espionage and security. “We want to enable them to upgrade,” he said.

Is the Indian Nuclear Doctrine Evolving?,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/is-the-indian-nuclear-doctrine-evolving,"Mar 22, 2017  |  Seema Sirohi","India’s nuclear doctrine may appear to be undergoing a shift towards conducting a ‘counterforce strike’ against Pakistan, but some experts see this as “mind games” that could set off a worrying chain of events in the region.

Washington: If India fears imminent use of nuclear weapons by Pakistan, will it go first, upending its doctrine of ‘no first use’, and conduct a comprehensive first strike, taking out Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal?

In other words, has India’s nuclear doctrine undergone a shift? Vipin Narang, a respected expert, raised the possibility at the Carnegie International Nuclear Policy Conference, causing a stir. The conference, held every two years to discuss nuclear weapons, proliferation and associated topics, is a gathering of the world’s top nuclear strategists.

Narang, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specialises in nuclear proliferation and strategy, said in his prepared remarks that there was increasing “evidence that India will not allow Pakistan to go first”.

India’s opening salvo may not be conventional strikes trying to pick off just Nasr batteries that can carry tactical nuclear weapons, but a full “comprehensive counterforce strike” that attempts to “completely disarm Pakistan of its nuclear weapons” so that India doesn’t have to expose its cities to nuclear destruction, Narang said. A counterforce strike refers to an attack on a country’s nuclear assets.

The analysis caused shock and awe among the nuclear elite, many of whom remain deeply suspicious and wary of India’s nuclear programme. George Perkovich, vice president of Carnegie and an opponent of the 2008 India-US nuclear deal, said ultimately it was about “psychological mind games” and sending signals. He questioned India’s capacity to conduct a “comprehensive” strike while warning of the massive costs involved in developing such capabilities.

Sameer Lalwani, deputy director of Stimson Center’s South Asia programme, said in an e-mail response that the risks of India changing its posture were worrisome. Pakistan would try to find ways to make its nuclear arsenal survive an Indian strike by “expansion of its missile arsenal, putting strategic nuclear weapons at sea, increasing arsenal readiness or reducing the timeline for launch”.

Such countermoves could increase instability in a crisis, rapidly escalate an arms race and eventually “start to erode deterrence stability with China,” Lalwani added.

But has India’s doctrine really changed or is everyone guessing? Narang thinks there are strong indications from key players to show things are no longer as they once seemed. He connects the dots from the writings and statements of India’s former national security adviser Shivshankar Menon, former defence minister Manohar Parrikar and former chief of strategic forces command, Lt. Gen. B.S. Nagal to argue that the strategy has shifted.

Speaking on Monday (March 20) on “Beyond the Nuclear Threshold: Causes and Consequences of First Use,” Narang said conventional wisdom on how nuclear weapons might be used in South Asia no longer applied.

He cited Menon’s recently released book, Choices: Inside the Making of Indian Foreign Policy, to argue that India’s doctrine appeared to have moved from “counter-value” strikes to “counter-force” strikes. In other words, from targeting population centres to aiming at Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal.

Menon, who as NSA was involved in decisions on targeting of nuclear weapons, talks of counter-value targeting in the past tense, saying it was the “logical posture at first,” implying it may no longer be. Menon goes on to say that if Pakistan were to use tactical nuclear weapons against India or appeared to be preparing to do so, it would “effectively be opening the door to a massive Indian first strike, having crossed India’s declared red lines.”

“There would be little incentive, once Pakistan had taken hostilities to the nuclear level, for India to limit its response, since that would only invite further escalation by Pakistan. India would hardly risk giving Pakistan the chance to carry out a massive nuclear strike after the Indian response to Pakistan using tactical nuclear weapons. In other words, Pakistani tactical nuclear weapons use [or imminent use] would effectively free India to undertake a comprehensive first strike against Pakistan,” Menon writes.

Narang said that this suggests that the country most likely to go first in South Asia “may not be Pakistan, but India,” if and when it believed that Pakistan was ready to cross the nuclear threshold. But Pakistan won’t sit idle in this scenario and would want to go first and massively, creating a dangerous instability.

Menon’s elaboration adds to what Lt. Gen. Nagal wrote in an article questioning the morality of a no first use policy and how the Indian leadership could accept significant casualties if it knew Pakistan’s use of nuclear weapons was imminent. He asked for change.

Last year, Parrikar, who was India’s defence minister at the time, said that India should not bind itself to a no first use policy and only stress that it will always act responsibly. He later clarified the comment, saying it was his “personal opinion,” further surprising nuclear experts.

The BJP manifesto for the 2014 national elections also hinted broadly at evolution. It promised to “revise and update” India’s nuclear doctrine but so far no public announcements have been made.

The publicly stated Indian doctrine remains one of not using a nuclear weapon first and not using one against a non-nuclear state. Pakistan does not have a no first use policy.

More to the point, if India decided to conduct a massive strike now, does it have the capacity to? Narang’s answer is “almost certainly not”. Currently, India doesn’t have the number of required warheads or missile defences but it is working on both fronts.

Narang also says there is little evidence that India can “find, fix and destroy Pakistan’s nuclear forces in real time” on land or sea. It’s unclear whether India has “a good fix” on all the locations of Pakistani strategic forces.

But it stands to reason that the Indian government would not reveal the exact nature or state of its nuclear arsenal, targeting abilities and quality of intelligence in its possession to outside experts. Ambiguity has been the hallmark of all things Indian.

But in Narang’s opinion, the various iterations on India’s nuclear doctrine show “confusion” not “ambiguity”.

India's Vote on the UN's LGBT Rights Resolution Dilutes Human Rights Principles,https://m.thewire.in/article/gender/diluting-human-rights-principles-indias-vote-on-the-resolution-on-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity,"Jul 05, 2016  |  Arvind Narrain","India failed to adhere to its own constitutional tenets by abstaining on the votes related to the establishment of the mandate, placing its cultural concerns above universal human rights.

On June 30, the UN Human Rights Council voted to establish the first Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI). The establishment of this historic mandate places the issue of sexual orientation and gender identity firmly within the remit of international human rights law. The independent expert’s annual reports will ensure that human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity are focused on, analysed and responded to by the UN system.

There were seventeen votes on the resolution seeking to establish an SOGI. India abstained on 11 of the 17 votes and voted with hostile nations to introduce six amendments with the sole intent of subverting the purpose of the resolution.

India abstained on the votes related to the establishment of the mandate and on amendments that sought to strip the words sexual orientation and gender identity from the resolution. India also abstained on the no action motion, which was a procedural manoeuvre meant to prevent any discussion on the subject itself. Finally, India abstained on the voting on the entire resolution and the mandate thereby stood established. However, there were six hostile amendments on which India voted with Pakistan, who represented the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) excluding Albania.

The amendments

The amendments on which India voted fell into four categories.

Firstly, those that sought to strip the resolution of the specificity of the language of sexual orientation and gender identity and replace it with other categories of discrimination, such as race, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status (amendments L 71, L72, L80).

Secondly, those amendments that sought to introduce problematic notions of cultural relativism as well as the importance of respecting domestic debates, and the importance of respecting regional, cultural and religious values systems in interpreting human rights (amendments 73,75, 76, 78 and 79).

Thirdly, amendments that were not problematic on substantive grounds but were moved with hostile intent. These included an amendment on combating racism and on deploring the use of coercive measures against developing nations (amendments 74 and 77).

Fourthly, an amendment that went to the heart of the resolution and sought to delete the operative paragraph setting up the mandate of the independent expert to assess the implementation of existing international human rights law on SOGI, raise awareness on violence and discrimination on grounds of SOGI, and address multiple and aggravated forms of violence and discrimination faced by persons on grounds of SOGI.

The amendments to fail were the ones that sought to strip the SOGI language from the resolution and the amendment establishing the mandate of the independent expert. India abstained on these amendments.

The amendments that sought to introduce problematic notions of cultural relativism, as well as those which sought to introduce language on combating racism and deploring unilateral coercive measures, were successful. India voted for all but one of these amendments.

Where does India stand on LGBT issues?

This differentiated voting by India indicates that it did not want to be seen as regressive and homophobic. Thus it abstained on the most egregious amendments going to the heart of the resolution. Abstention on this is also possibly linked to the fact that the LGBT movement has high visibility in the Indian context and a negative vote was sure to dent India’s international image as the world’s largest democracy.

This strong domestic pressure combined with the need of the current administration to appear in a favourable global light possibly pushed the current administration to abandon an overt homophobic stance (as in the previous vote in the General Assembly where India opposed extending partnership benefits to same sex couples) in favour of a feigned neutrality.

However this brings little credit to the government. The continued failure to repeal IPC Section 377 only highlights the unwillingness of the Modi government to see LGBT persons as citizens of India entitled to full constitutional rights. On the international level when India abstains on a resolution meant to address violence and discrimination on grounds of SOGI, it sends a message that the continued endemic violence against LGBT people is of little concern to the Indian government.

This abstention on the resolution as a whole was accompanied by India voting for the amendments proposed by Pakistan, some of which sought to dilute a core principle of international human rights, i.e., the universality of human rights.

Amendment L 75 reads: Reiterating the importance of respecting regional, cultural and religious value systems as well as particularities in considering human rights; while amendment L 76 reads: Underlining that fundamental importance of respecting the relevant domestic debates at the national level on matters associated with historical, cultural, social and religious sensitivities.

These amendments seek to undo the international consensus that cultural sensitivity must always yield to the duty of all states to protect universal human rights as embodied in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. Paragraph 5 of the Vienna Declaration (which is recalled in paragraph 2 of the SOGI resolution) notes that ‘while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of states regardless of their political, economic and cultural system to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms’. It is troubling that India should ally itself with efforts to undo a fundamental tenet of human rights – that it is universal.

This deference to cultural and religious value systems is particularly problematic in the Indian context as it reinforces casteist practices and gender discrimination, not to mention discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. An unqualified deference to cultural and religious value systems is also antithetical to the Indian constitutional framework.

The freedom of religion clause in the constitution (Article 25) is specifically subjected to the limitations imposed by the other fundamental rights. This is because the constitution accommodates the concerns of women members of the Constituent Assembly, such as Hansa Mehta, who talked about how the freedom of religion could well become the tyranny of religion, especially over women.

Similarly the practice of untouchability is at heart a cultural practice undergirded by a religious value system. This practice was declared a constitutional crime under Article 17. What the criminalisation of the practice of untouchability indicates is that the Indian Constitution is no passive supporter of culture and tradition. Rather, the Constitution prohibits cultural practices which violate fundamental rights.

When India votes for these amendments, it shows a profound lack of respect for the Constitution and its values. A mere declaration by the prime minister that the Constitution is the holy book, signifies nothing until India votes in accordance with the Constitution’s tenets and stops exalting religion and culture over basic freedoms of the individual.

Dismantling the human rights framework

The Indian vote on the resolution to establish the independent expert in its entirety, is nothing to be proud of. Instead of standing with progressive voices in the international community, India choose to ally itself with those who seek to dismantle the very framework of international human rights law.

However, despite the brazen efforts by Pakistan and the OIC to destroy the resolution along with the covert support from nations like India, the heart of the resolution – the establishment of the mandate – survived. All amendments that were carried were to the preambular paragraphs and not to the operative paragraphs, which establish the nature and scope of the mandate of the independent expert.

It will now be up to the independent expert, once appointed, to take forward the operative part of the resolution and through their work reaffirm the commitment to combatting discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity as part of their wider commitment to the principle of universal human rights.

How India responds to the process as it unfolds in Geneva will be watched with great interest.

India Must Support  Universal Human Rights by Voting Against Suspension of UN LGBT Expert,https://m.thewire.in/article/gender/india-must-show-support-for-universal-human-rights-by-voting-against-suspension-of-first-un-lgbt-expert,"Nov 07, 2016  |  Arvind Narrain","A resolution introduced by the Africa group in the UN General Assembly seeks to suspend the independent expert on sexual orientation and gender identity, a position established in June.

In a historic decision in June, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) voted to establish the first UN independent expert on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). The vote itself was contested with 23 countries voting for the resolution, 18 against and six abstaining. Unlike the establishment of other special procedures, the countries that were on the losing side of the vote – OIC countries led by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, with the exception of Albania and Russia – vowed to not cooperate with the mandate.

The extent to which this non-cooperation would be taken was seen in the resolution introduced by the African Group in the Third Committee of the General Assembly in the debate on the Report of the Human Rights Council in November. Usually a routine resolution by the African Group to adopt the report of the UNHRC, this time around it stated that the group “decides to defer consideration of and action on Human Rights Council resolution 32/2 of June 30, 2016, on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, in order to allow time for further consultations to determine the legal basis upon which the mandate of the special procedure established therein will be defined.”

The African Group in their statement went on to call for the “suspension of the activities of the appointed independent expert pending the determination of this issue.” Among the reasons underlying this call was that “non-internationally agreed notions such as sexual orientation and gender identity are given attention, to the detriment of issues of paramount importance such as the right to development and the racism agenda.”

The African Group also stated that the appointment of the independent expert would “delve into matters which fall essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of states counter to the commitment in the United Nations Charter to respect the sovereignty of states and the principle of non-intervention.”

How should India respond to this African resolution, which will likely face vigorous opposition by the Latin American, European, North American and Asian states that voted for the establishment of the independent expert? Which way should India vote?

India’s track record on LGBT issues

For the record, India abstained on the vote to establish the independent expert on SOGI. India has a mixed record on voting on issues pertaining to LGBT rights at the UN level. In September 2014 – less than four months after the Modi government came to power – India abstained from the vote on a resolution on sexual orientation and gender identity at the UNHRC. However, in March 2015, India joined Russia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, China and Iran in voting against extending the benefits available to heterosexual couples to same-sex couples at the UN General Assembly. However, with respect to voting on whether the language on sexual orientation should be removed from a series of resolutions on extrajudicial executions at the UNGA, India has consistently voted to retain the language of ‘sexual orientation’.

If India votes to suspend the working of the duly-elected mandate holder on SOGI, it will send out a message that LGBT people are not entitled to full protection under international human rights laws. Sending out such a message at this moment in time would only exacerbate concerns around how the Modi government views LGBT rights. With the failure to support parliamentary efforts at decriminalising same-sex conduct as well as backsliding on the protection of transgender rights with the introduction of the highly regressive Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, India does not have a favourable track record on LGBT issues. This vote is an opportunity for the Indian government to show that it stands by the notion that LGBT people are entitled to the full protection under human rights laws.

Do the Africa Group’s objections hold?

The logic of the African Group that the very appointment of the independent expert interferes with the “domestic jurisdiction” and “sovereignty” of the state might have some sway with India. However, the falsity of this claim needs to be exposed. The independent expert, as per his mandate in resolution 30/2, is expected to “assess the implementation of existing international human rights laws and standards”, “to raise awareness of violence and discrimination against persons on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity”, “to engage in dialogue and consult with states and other relevant stakeholders”, “to work in cooperation with states in order to foster the implementation of measures that contribute to the protection of all persons against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity”.

The fact that concerns with respect to violations on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity would be raised by the independent expert cannot in itself amount to a violation of sovereignty, especially when the mandate holder’s task is laid down in language such as “assess”, “raise awareness”, “engage in dialogue” and “work in cooperation”.

The argument of the African Group that the protection of SOGI rights detracts from the right to development and anti-racism sets up a false dichotomy. It intentionally ignores the fact that the SOGI mandate is envisaged as an intersectional mandate. In a preambular paragraph, the mandate is tasked with “undertaking to support its broad and balanced agenda and to strengthen the mechanisms addressing issues of importance, including fighting racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in all their forms”. Resolution 30/2 of the UNHRC in operative para two is explicitly committed to “address the multiple, intersecting and aggravated forms of violence and discrimination faced by persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity”.

Standing up for universal rights

India’s vote should factor in the understanding that as far as this resolution by the African Group is concerned, its implications are not only with respect to LGBT rights but also about the working and credibility of the human rights system. The attempt to suspend the working of the mandate holder who has been duly appointed by the UNHRC would severely impact the credibility of the UN rights body.

Challenging the resolutions passed by the UNHRC at the UNGA makes a mockery of the existence of the organisation. In effect, by doing so we are saying that decision-making at the UNHRC can be challenged by any aggrieved group of states at the Third Committee. In the year of the 20th anniversary of the UNHRC, this resolution is a blow to the functioning and decision-making of the council itself. If this resolution is passed, years from now it will be seen as the first nail in the coffin of the UNHRC.

If India wants to be seen as defending the principle of universal human rights as well as the institutional architecture of international human rights, it is imperative that it votes against the resolution calling for the suspension of the mandate of the independent expert on SOGI.

"Sold as a 'First', Modi's RoRo Is Already a Go Go For Both Indians and India Inc",https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/modis-roro-already-go-go-comes-india-inc,"Oct 24, 2017  |  Noor Mohammad","Modi, while inaugurating a RoRo ferry service in Gujarat, said it was the first of its kind. But RoRo vessels have been used by companies to move goods and by a handful of state governments to move normal passengers.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the Rs 600 crore roll-on, roll-off (RoRo) Ghogha-Dahej ferry service as the first of its kind, not only for India but also for Southeast Asia, while inaugurating the project during his recent visit to Gujarat.

This surprised many as RoRo vessels are already being used by companies to move cars, coal and fertiliser across the country. All key ports in the country provide RoRo shipping service.

The only difference is that the Ghogha-Dahej route carries passenger traffic too, unlike others which are exclusively being used for transporting goods. However, even here, much smaller ferries in Goa, Kerala and Andaman transport passengers too. In Maharashtra, ferry services are available between Alibaug and Mumbai (Gateway of India). In fact, the fastest and cheapest way to travel between the two places is ferry.

The ferry service between Ferry Wharf or Bhaucha Dhakka in Mumbai and Panjim in Goa was operational as far back as 1970s. The service was discontinued during Indian peace-keeping mission in Sri Lanka when ferries were diverted for carrying Indian troops to the war-zone. The Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) and Goa Port Trust are again coming together to resume the ferry service which will have stoppages at Dighi in Raigad district, Dabhol and Jaigad in Ratnagiri district, Vijay Durg and Malvan too.

The Vizag-Kakinda sea cruise was planned as far back as 2003. It is another matter it got shelved later. In July 2015, the Andhra Pradesh government decided to revive the project to give a boost to the state tourism.

Industry use

When it comes to India Inc, these type of ferries have become increasingly common over the last few years For example, Hyundai Motor uses RoRo vessels to ships its cars across India to save cost and reduce carbon footprint. In February 2016, Hyundai had sent 800 cars from its Sriperumbudur plant through RoRo vessel IDM Symex to Pipavav port in Gujarat via Chennai port.

It usually takes three to four days for the car manufacturer to move vehicles from the production centres near Chennai to Gujarat through trailers.

Vessel owner Symex Maritime has been granted permission by the Directorate General of Shipping to carry out coastal run for five years. The RoRo vessel, IDM Symex, is to be used to transport cars manufactured mainly by Hyundai and other manufacturers.

Maruti Suzuki too uses 1,275 km-long Varansi-Haldia waterway to transport Alto and Celerio cars. This is meant to reduce dependence on road and rail and also cut fuel costs.

The company first moves the cars by road from its Gurgaon factory to Varanasi, where they are put on the Ro-Ro vessel and transported to Haldia. It takes one and a half to two days to move the cars by road from Gurgaon to Varanasi and the journey from Varanasi to Haldia takes another seven days.

NTPC transports its imported coal consignments from Sandheads deep-sea port, 200 km off Kolkata, to its Farakka power plant in the state through the 1,600-km Haldia-Allahabad national waterway. The PSU started using this mode for coal transportation to the plant from October 2013 to overcome shortage of rail rakes.

Gujarat Pipavav Port started its RoRo service for automobile cargo in August 2015 and now it plans to triple its handling capacity to 300,000 cars by 2020.

Shipping companies are increasingly entering the RoRo segment to offset weakness in core shipping segments, such as bulk cargo, said analysts.

According to a recent study by the World Bank, Inland waterway transportation was in vogue in India before the arrival of railways. The Ganga river used to be a busy waterway until a hundred years ago before it fell into disuse after trains became a favoured mode of transporting goods and passengers.

In September last year, the ministry of shipping doubled the discount to 80% for two years on vessel and coastal related charges to promote RoRo shipping.

The incentive was meant to attract more automobile cargo through the coastal route and decongest the already congested roads and railways, besides making the Ro-Ro ship service operations more sustainable.

RoRo services are used in other parts of Southeast Asia as well. In Malaysia, RoRo ferries have been running since 2013, and in April this year, a RoRo service was launched between Indonesia and Philippines.

The Idea of India Makes Little Room for Its Ecology,https://m.thewire.in/article/environment/the-idea-of-india-makes-little-room-for-its-ecology,"Mar 01, 2016  |  Nagraj Adve","At a time when public debate about nationalism and the idea of India is being intensely conducted across university campuses and in millions of drawing rooms, we must remind ourselves that our lives, culture and understanding of land are ecologically grounded. An ecological perspective interrogates dominant views of nationalism and allows us to approach the question with greater nuance and sensitivity.

A couple of years ago, I went to the Sunderbans – the vast deltaic ecosystem straddling eastern India and Bangladesh – to talk to people there about how sea level rise was affecting their lives. An encroaching sea had been nibbling away at those islands for years – and continues to do so – causing tens of thousands to abandon their homes and fields, and move further inland, or move out. We stayed one night at the edge of Sagar island; all along that stretch of coast were abandoned homes and saline lands, broken trunks of dead coconut trees jutting into the sky, creating a landscape one can only describe as surreal.

This erosion of our lands is happening not just in West Bengal, but in many parts across India’s vast coastline. It’s happening along parts of the Orissa and Tamil Nadu coasts; on the other side of the Indian landmass, it was reported some years ago that the advancing sea was forcing people to move out from Gujarat’s Valsad and Bharuch districts. “The poorest are the most directly affected,” said a scientist who studied this manifestation of global warming. “They can’t afford to shift but they can’t stay here either.”

That sea level rise is going to increase and accelerate over the next few years and decades is an accepted scientific fact; the only point of debate is how fast this will happen. It will happen to a greater degree because the great ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica will melt at an accelerating rate, a trend that may have already begun. Most timeframes of this process tend to stop at the end of this century, but the nature of ice sheet melting is such that once it starts, it carries on for thousands of years. The greatest threat to our lands may come from just beyond our shores, not from what we think, but from the sea.

If any of us have fixed geographical notions of the nation-state, the rise and fall of sea levels everywhere ought to give us pause. Not just in warnings about the near future, but also lessons from the past. As the Earth went into and out of warm interglacials – such as the present one – water got frozen in the ice sheets at the peak of ice ages or melted into the sea during the interglacials, altering the levels of ocean waters by dozens of metres and re-creating land borders in the process. Not just here, but also elsewhere; perhaps the most striking example is the Channel that now divides England and Europe. At one time, England and France were contiguous landmass. Over anything beyond the short term, our borders are drawn not by us, but by the oceans.

There are at least two other ways in which global warming and its effects gently – and sometimes more abruptly – interrogate our modern political imagination of the nation. Some ecosystems effortlessly straddle national boundaries. That is to state the obvious; but in an era of global warming, so do its effects, which raises questions about how we ought to respond. Most of the hundreds of glaciers studied across the Himalayan ecosystem are melting – in India, Pakistan and China. A number of Asia’s legendary rivers – including the Indus, the Brahmaputra, the Salween, the Mekong and the Yangtze – originate in the glaciated heights of the Tibetan Plateau. The effects of global warming in one region will hurt people across boundaries. This particularly holds true for the Indus, whose waters derive – much more than say, the Ganga or the Brahmaputra – to an overwhelming degree from glacial melt. Glaciers melting and then receding in Tibet will dry up the Indus, and will devastate agriculture and shrink water supplies for millions of people dependent on them beyond its borders, in Ladakh, and in Pakistan. Ecological crises of this nature and scale demand political and policy responses that transcend rigid nation-state frames.

Third, as global warming’s effects begin to intensify and speed up, millions of people will pour across borders. Some studies indicate that one of the multiple, complex factors that have influenced the current refugee crisis in Europe is the massive drought – likely influenced by climate change – that has hit Syria over the past few years. As rising sea levels engulf the Maldives and particularly large tracts of low-lying Bangladesh, India becomes an obvious destination for their climate refugees. If you’re alarmed at the prospect, reflect on the fact that migration might also likely happen in the other direction – desperate Indians also running away, from persistent droughts, a collapsing agriculture and rising heat levels. These are not prognostications; the signs of all of these have already begun. They might end up being internal migrants, or migrate beyond our shores to places with more water or a more hospitable climate. Will they be received with greater grace than the Shiv Sena displayed a few years ago towards job-seeking migrants from North India? Will they be more welcome than the Syrian and other refugees are in Europe presently?

The answers to those questions will depend upon the openness, or rigidity, with which people here and elsewhere regard the idea of the nation, who ‘we’ are. Ecologies and a changing climate – which is far more powerful than we give it credit – ought to make us realise that a hard notion does not capture changing complexities, nor is very helpful. On the other hand, greater flexibility and more humbleness may make us better prepared to cope with the challenges that a warming climate and other ecological crises pose before us.

No Lessons Learnt From Quakes in India's Northeast,https://m.thewire.in/article/science/no-lessons-learnt-quakes-indias-northeast,"Jan 16, 2018  |  Dinesh C. Sharma","Due to the government’s negligence, many publicly funded buildings suffered severe damage during a recent quake in Imphal – which is both ironic and a betrayal of public trust.

New Delhi: It is often said that earthquakes don’t kill people, the buildings do. If building codes have not been enforced in seismically active zones, even moderate intensity quakes can cause widespread damage to structures and injure people. This is what has been happening in India’s northeast region, according to a new study.

Manipur was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 on January 4, 2016, that devastated the state capital Imphal and adjoining areas. The event also gave scientists a chance to understand the risks posed to buildings and construction practices in the region. While many buildings collapsed, it had been noted that the damage caused to public buildings was disproportionate to the quake’s observed intensity.

Scientists from three IITs – Kanpur, Guwahati and Patna – undertook a reconnaissance survey of quake-affected regions right after the Imphal quake, and visited the area after three months to study the condition of damaged structures and supervise restoration work. The results of this study were published in the journal Current Science.

They found that while several reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Imphal had suffered varying degrees of damage, traditional wooden houses made with bamboo and wood (known as ‘shing-khim’) reported none. Government buildings were damaged heavily because they had not conformed to the seismic code, exacerbated by the poor quality of raw materials and shoddy workmanship.

“The seismic risk in the region is growing at an alarming pace with an increasing inventory of vulnerable construction,” the study concluded. The 2016 quake, it said, “should be regarded as a preview of what is likely to happen in the event of greater shaking expected for the region and should hasten the community to take necessary steps.”

Durgesh C. Rai, a professor of civil engineering at IIT Kanpur and a member of the study, told India Science Wire that “despite considerable awareness in public about earthquakes and associated risks, both public and administrators chose to ignore the threat and continued to build structures [that] were not earthquake-resistant.” Due to such negligence, he said, “many publicly funded buildings suffered severe damage under shaking intensity of VI–VII, which is not only ironic but also represents the utter betrayal of public trust.”

Buildings at the inter-state bus terminal, the Government Polytechnic and Central Agriculture University (CAU) are all structures whose construction has been under government supervision and with public money. They were expected to ‘perform’ satisfactorily during earthquakes – but they all experienced moderate to severe damage. Large campuses like the CAU have been built atop landfill soil and so they performed very poorly during the quake, the study said.

New concrete buildings of the famous Ima Keithel also suffered damage. This market had earlier made do with bamboo structures; they were functional but in bad condition. So the government dismantled the market and built three concrete structures in 2010. All three buildings had a similar elevation and plan but only one of them experienced the quake the way it was designed to.

“Traditional constructions using lighter timber and bamboo have performed well and no damage to such structures in Imphal was reported,” Rai added. “Despite available knowledge, seismic safety remains neglected and society is not adequately prepared due to lack of implementation.” He said the lessons from the Manipur quake are applicable to the entire northeast region.

The Last Pillar of Indian Democracy Weakens Itself,https://m.thewire.in/article/law/the-last-pillar-of-indian-democracy-has-crumbled,"May 05, 2018  |  Prem Shankar Jha","A careful reading of the Supreme Court’s judgment dismissing the demand for an independent probe into the death of judge B.H. Loya – who was presiding over the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case at the time – reveals little that one can take exception to. But that is only because the court restricted its inquiry to whether sufficient grounds existed for suspecting that Loya might not have died of natural causes.

What the Supreme Court ruled out from consideration at the very first hearing was any discussion of whether Loya, who could easily have had a previously undiagnosed heart condition, might have been driven to his death by the pressures that he came under, and about which he spoke on more than one occasion to his family and friends.

Its caution would have been justified if it had been required to make a finding on the cause of Loya’s death. But all it had been asked to do was authorise an independent investigation into the circumstances of his death. It is a matter of record that within four weeks of the November 30, 2014 death, BJP president Amit Shah ended up getting discharged from the Sohrabuddin case. The two articles in Caravan magazine that the Supreme Court referred to had awoken fears that had lain dormant for three years.

These fears needed to be put to rest. That is why some concerned citizens had turned first to the Bombay high court and then to the Supreme Court for reassurance. If the apex court wanted to retain the peoples’ trust in the judiciary, it had a duty to do everything possible to clear the air. It did the exact opposite. To appreciate the full extent of its dereliction from this larger duty to the people, one needs to revisit the circumstances in which judge Loya died.

Loya died only 14 days before a deadline he had set for commencing hearings on the extra-judicial killing of two criminals, Sohrabuddin Sheikh and Tulsiram Prajapati, and of the wife of the former, Kausar Bi, by a handpicked group of police officers and constables of the Gujarat police, in two fake encounters in 2005 and 2006.

in 2007, K.T.S Tulsi, then counsel for the state of Gujarat, had deposed before the Gujarat high court that these were fake encounters carried out by the police. The fact is that the police worked directly under then state home minister Amit Shah. Shah was later indicted in both of these because a detailed CBI investigation, carried out by a superintendent of police of the Maharashtra crime branch, Sandeep Tamgadge, had determined that the accused policemen had acted under his direction.

In the seven years that had preceded the Bharatiya Janata Party’s victory in 2014, Shah had been taken into judicial custody twice, the second time for several months and, when bailed out the second time, had been barred from entering Gujarat for two years to prevent him from tampering with evidence that the CBI claimed to have gathered.

The trial Loya was to have presided over had been shifted by the Supreme Court from Gujarat to Maharashtra in September 2012 , at the request of the CBI, because witnesses were being systematically intimidated in Gujarat. Citing an earlier case from Punjab, Ravinder Pal Singh vs. Sandeep Kumar Jaiswal, where those accused of faking an encounter were policemen, the Supreme Court had held that “The case in hand (CBI vs D.G.Vanzara) has far stronger reasons for being transferred out of the state,” and directed that it should be transferred to Maharashtra. It had further directed the administrative committee of the Bombay high court “to assign the case in a court where the trial could be held judiciously, in accordance with the law and without delay. It also directed the administrative committee to ensure that the trial should be conducted from beginning to end by the same officer”.

The administrative committee selected J.T. Utpat to be the special judge for the case. Between September 27, 2012 and June 20, 2014, Utpat set one date after another for Shah to appear before the court, but Shah repeatedly ignored the summons, till Utpat ran out of patience. When Shah’s lawyers sought his exemption from appearance for the second time within a month, on June 20, 2014, having obtained it once already on June 6, Utpat said, “Every time you are giving an exemption application without assigning any reason,” and fixed July 4 for the next hearing. But just five days later, and 10 days before the next hearing, with total disregard for the directive that had been given by the Supreme Court, Utpat was transferred to Pune and Loya appointed in his place. When the CBI court reconvened after a five-week summer break, Loya fixed a date for the hearing on October 31. When Shah again did not turn up, despite actually being in Mumbai for a political function on the appointed date, Loya too scolded him and fixed the next hearing for December 15. Loya died of a heart attack in Nagpur 16 days before that deadline.

This was only the first of a series of inexplicable events. The Bombay high court administrative committee hastily replaced him with judge M.B Gosavi. On December 30, just 15 days after the deadline that Loya had set, he dismissed all charges against Shah. He did this in spite of the fact that the CBI had furnished call records from Shah’s phone to the court which showed that Shah had talked to the indicted police officers, notably D.G Vanzara, Rajkumar Pandian and N.K Amin, 14 times in the three days between Sohrabuddin Sheikh’s capture and ‘execution’ in November 2005 and, 37 times during December 2006, when Prajapati was killed in a similar ‘encounter’.

Fourteen of these calls had been placed between December 10 and 12, after Prajapati had been brought from Rajasthan to the Sabarmati jail in Ahmedabad, before being ‘escorted’ to Banaskantha, and between December 26 and 30, two days before and after Prajapati met his end. None of this cut any ice with Gosavi, who accepted the defence’s plea that phone calls were Shah’s normal way of communicating with his subordinates. Shah walked out of his court a free man without standing trial or being cross-examined.

This sequence of events raises several questions: First, why did the Bombay high court’s administrative committee (AC) not protest against the transfer of Utpat to Pune? Utpat claimed later that he had asked for the transfer for personal reasons connected with his daughter’s education. But why did the AC, which was bound by a Supreme Court directive to ensure that only one judge hear the entire case, not attempt to dissuade Utpat?

Second, what could conceivably have been so important about his daughter’s education that Utpat had no option but to leave Mumbai, and that too not temporarily but permanently? Even if he had pressing personal reasons that he did not wish to disclose, why did he have to make this permanent move just 10 days before the date he had himself fixed for the next hearing ? Could his wife not have gone with their daughter to Pune? Did he have no relatives there? For that matter, could he not have postponed the date for the next hearing by a few weeks? After all, Shah would have been the last person to object. Finally, why did Utpat have to go to Pune in June, when school and college summer vacations had not ended and the new semester had not begun?

Gosavi’s summary dismissal of the case raised two further questions: if Shah’s innocence was so easy to establish, why had he evaded hearing after hearing for two years and four months? And if he had been so determined to avoid a hearing before, why did he agree to appear before Gosavi?

Clearly, there was the stench of rotting flesh in the air. The Supreme Court was the only institution in the country with sufficient credibility to clear it. Justice Mishra’s bench chose not to do so.

Instead, it launched an unprecedented diatribe not only against the petitioners , accusing them of ‘lacking in bona fides, and… misusing the judicial process”, and committing contempt of court for which only the magnanimity of the judges has saved them from punishment. As if that was not enough, it virtually closed the door on public interest litigation by saying that it would only hear “genuine cases, moved by persons acting in the public interest alone who stood to gain nothing personally from the litigation.”

Those whom it excoriated and threatened included a former chief of the Indian navy, now in his eighties; a highly respected human rights lawyer ranked recently by Fortune magazine as 20th among the 50 greatest leaders of the world, a group of lawyers from the Bombay high court, and a renowned civil rights activist, none of whom stood to gain anything personal from an independent investigation into the death of Loya. If these people could not meet the criterion of ‘no personal interest in the outcome apart from general standing as a citizen before the court’ then who could?

In the three years since Shah walked free, India has become a stranger to law. All the eight senior police officers accused with him in a succession of fake encounters, all the accused in the Mecca Masjid bombing; in the Samjhauta Express bombing, in the Jaipur and Malegaon bomb blasts and a score of other such outrages, have walked free.

Former Gujarat minister Maya Kodnani, earlier given a 28-year sentence after being identified and traced through phone records as having been present at the Naroda Patiya massacre in Ahmedabad in 2002, has been acquitted on appeal by the Gujarat high court along with 17 others only weeks ago.

Today the grandiloquence of the Supreme Court will not restore faith in the law and the courts of this land. Between the law’s mounting delays, the brutal and extortionate behaviour of the police, the rampant corruption in the lower judiciary, and the quirkiness of judgments of the higher courts, a conviction has settled in among ordinary people that they will receive no justice and no protection from the appointed guardians of the law."

Strange and Arbitrary Bail Orders: Are Indian Judges Going Too Far?,https://m.thewire.in/article/law/judges-bail-orders,"Apr 29, 2020  |  Faizan Mustafa","In granting bail one must balance the personal liberty of the accused with public justice. Lately, there have been many problematic bail orders both in terms of their length, what they stated as well as the conditions these orders imposed. Recently while granting bail to Som Marandi, former BJP member of parliament, and five others, the Jharkhand high court directed each one of them to deposit Rs 35,000 in the newly formed PM CARES Fund and download the Aarogya Setu app.

The contact tracing app was recently launched to fight COVID-19 and has been downloaded by more than five crore Indians though concerns about privacy have also been raised as the government may get access to lot personal information of its citizens. The law is clear that the conditions imposed on the grant of bail which has no nexus with the object and purpose of bail and tends to be in the nature of harassment to the individual with overtones on one’s constitutional and legal rights cannot be brought within the purview of the lawful exercise of ‘judicial discretion’. Thus the requirement that the bail amount be furnished in cash was also held as illegal.

Let us talk of other strange bail orders. In July 2019, one Richa Bharti, who was arrested for writing an offensive post on social media against Muslims, was given bail by judicial magistrate Manish Kumar Singh in Jharkhand on the condition that she should distribute five copies of Quran to different libraries. Subsequently, this condition was withdrawn.

Justice Pratibha Rani of the Delhi high court in 2016 passed a 27-page long bail controversial order in the sedition case against the then JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar. She did not hesitate in mentioning majoritarian rhetoric on “anti-national attitudes” in her order but ignored the established convention of keeping bail order brief. She also, completely out of context, referred to borders being kept secure by our forces and connected it with citizens’ freedom of speech. She unnecessarily indicted and stigmatised the country’s top university and asked the JNU faculty to pay the bond of Rs 10,000. She also imposed several conditions on Kanhaiya’s participation in what she termed as ‘anti-national activities’.

Earlier this year, while granting bail to Swami Chinmayanand, the former Union minister and BJP leader who was accused of sexual harassment by a female law student of his college, Justice Rahul Chaturvedi of the Allahabad high court in his 25 page bail order made several unwarranted comments against the victim. Though the Amarmani Tripathi (2005) judgment of the apex court was quoted by the learned judge, it was not properly applied. In Amarmani Tripathi judgment, the highest court had said that while granting bail, judges should keep in mind factors such as ‘character, behaviour, means, position and standing of accused.’ The accused here was too powerful and the victim really powerless but the court overlooked this vital factor. In fact, this bail order looked like the final judgment of the case, even as bail orders are not supposed to make any determination of the guilt or otherwise of the accused.

In a case about three men who allegedly murdered a young Pune techie Mohsin Sheikh in 2014, Justice Mridula Bhatkar observed in her six-page order that the victim was wearing, a “pastel green colour shirt and had sported a beard”. “The fault of the deceased was only that he belonged to another religion. I consider this factor in favour of the applicant/accused. Moreover, the applicants/accused do not have criminal record and it appears in the name of religion, they were provoked and have committed murder,” the judge said while granting bail.

The order is shocking and dangerous as it rewrites the whole jurisprudence of provocation. Provocation cannot be claimed against anything which is lawful – to be Muslim, to wear a green shirt or sport a beard has not yet been made unlawful in India. Moreover, provocation cannot be voluntarily sought. In this case, the accused out of their own free will went to listen to the speeches at a Hindu Rashtriya Sena event. This was a strange justification for granting bail.

Binayak Sen was denied bail for years though he had not killed anyone. The charge against him was that he was allegedly a courier between jailed Naxal leader Naryan Sanyal and businessman Piyush Sinha because he met Sanyal 33 times, each time with due permission by jail authorities. The evidence against him comprised of a postcard written by Sanyal about his health and legal case duly signed by the jail authorities; a book on unity between CPI and Maoist Communist Centre and a letter from Madanlal Barkhade. Even an appeal for the release of Sen by Noam Chomsky and 22 Nobel Laureates did not move the then UPA government which had sided with the BJP government of Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh. Finally, the Supreme Court granted Sen bail.

The Bombay high court denied bail to disabled Delhi University Professor G.N. Saibaba who travels in a wheel chair. Even his temporary bail was withdrawn. All the co-accused of Saibaba were granted bail but the principle of parity was not accepted in his case.

More recently, scholar Anand Teltumbde, who is 70 and suffering from respiratory and heart diseases was denied interim bail by a special court in Mumbai though one sub-inspector posted at the offices of the National Intelligence Agency office of Mumbai tested positive for COVID-19. The civil rights activist was not immediately quarantined but was in fact taken to the court in an NIA vehicle and then moved to the crowded Arthur Road Jail. The charge against this eminent scholar is that he was a part of Elgar Parishad where the ‘conspiracy’ to congregate at Bhima Koregaon was hatched.

On the other hand, a former Gujarat minister Maya Kodyani who had been convicted for the Naroda Patiya riot case and was undergoing imprisonment of 28 years too was granted bail on July 30, 2014, on the grounds of ill-health. Similarly, in January 2020, the Supreme Court in an unprecedented order granted bail to thirteen convicts of post-Godhra massacre in which as many as 33 people were burnt alive in Sardarpyra. The court asked them to undertake social service and stay out of Gujarat.

Indian bail laws

Let us now understand the law of bail, which has been around for a long time. As far back as 399 BC, Plato is supposed to have suggested the release of Socrates’ against a bond. The law of bail is a ‘cobweb’, encompassing the issues of personal liberty, public concern and interests of justice. After the 2008 amendment to Cr.PC, now arrests cannot be made in a routine manner and for an offence which is punishable with seven years’ or less imprisonment. In Arnesh Kumar (2014), the Supreme Court clearly laid down that in every arrest the police officer must ask himself as to why the accused should be arrested. Is it really required? What purpose will it serve? What objective it will achieve?

There are two types of crimes: bailable and non-bailable. In the former, bail can be claimed by the accused as a matter of right, in the latter bail is the discretion of the judge. In Rasik Lal (2009), the apex court itself said that bail is ‘an absolute and indefeasible right’ and ‘no discretion can be exercised’ in bailable offences. In these cases, there is no need for the public prosecutor or for the complainant to be heard.

Moreover, the Supreme Court categorically observed that ‘the court has no discretion to impose any conditions except to demand security.’ Thus conditions such as surrender of passport or non-participation in public demonstration or prohibition of making speech or appearance before commissioner cannot be imposed. Similarly, under Section 167 of Cr.PC, a person has an absolute statutory right to bail if he is accused of an offence punishable with death, life imprisonment or ten years’ imprisonment and an investigation is not completed within ninety days and within sixty days for other crimes.

Judicial discretion in bail

In non-bailable offences, bail is discretionary and there are conditions that the judge may impose. In Govind Prasad (1975), the apex court rightly held that the granting of bail is indeed a judicial, not a ministerial act. The discretion cannot be arbitrarily exercised. In Harnairain Singh (1958), the Supreme Court itself said that this discretion must be judicially exercised subject to restrictions mentioned in Section 437(1) of Cr.PC. and keeping in view enormity of charge, nature of accusation, severity of punishment on conviction, possibility of accused absconding if released on bail, the danger of witnesses being tampered with, health, age and sex of accused etc.

Under Section 337(3), if the crime is punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or more, the court can impose conditions aimed at ensuring the accused’s presence at the trial, ensuring the accused does not commit a similar offence and the non-tampering of evidence. The judge may also impose ‘in the interests of justice’ such conditions as it considers necessary. Is downloading of the Aarogya Setu app a condition in the interest of justice?

The archaic Indian law on bail due to the concept of pecuniary ‘surety’ already had a class character wherein, for the rich, bail is the rule and for poor, invariably, jail. Justice Krishna Iyer in the Moti Ram case where a poor labourer was asked a surety of Rs 10,000 in 1978 was pained to observe that “the poor are priced out of their liberty in the justice market.” Lately, it would appear that religion is the new class.

The judicial discretion in granting bail is not too wide and cannot be used in an arbitrary manner; sound discretion is guided by law and governed by rule, not by humour and cannot be arbitrary, vague and fanciful.

New Panama Paper Leaks Shed Light on Offshore Dealings of More Indians,https://m.thewire.in/article/business/new-panama-paper-leaks-shed-light-on-offshore-dealings-of-more-indians,"Jun 21, 2018  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: A new set of Panama Papers released on Thursday throw light on the offshore financial dealings of more Indians – Ajay Bijli, owner of PVR Cinemas, Kavin Bharti Mittal, CEO of Hike Messenger and son of Airtel promoter Sunil Mittal and Jalaj Ashwin Dani, son of Asian Paints promoter Ashwin Dani.

They also show how chaotic and panicked Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca’s response was to the global crackdown on its clients by investigative agencies in the aftermath of the last set of leaks in 2016.

The Indian Express, along with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, perused 1.2 million fresh documents, of which at least 12,000 are linked to Indians, according to a report which is the first of a series the national daily has planned based on the new leak.

While these leaks do not automatically show evidence of any wrongdoing or criminal activity, ICIJ believes that it will provide more leads for tax authorities around the world to follow.

This second lot of the Panama Papers also shows that following the April 2016 expose, Mossack Fonseca first asked several companies set up by Indians to produce missing information, including the name of the ‘beneficial owner’ and then served 90-day notices to warn them that the law firm would resign as their ‘registered agent’ if they failed to meet legal due diligence requirements.

Shiv Khemka, Amitabh Bachchan, Jehangir Sorabjee, DLF Group-promoter K.P. Singh and his immediate family, Anurag Kejriwal, Navin Mehra of Mehrasons Jewellers and Hajra Iqbal Memon and his family are prominent Indians whose links to offshore entities have been confirmed by Mossack Fonseca in this series of messages.

As an example, following the 2016 expose, Mossack Fonseca, in a communication, named Bachchan as director of two companies – Lady Shipping Ltd and Treasure Shipping Ltd – and subsequently served him a 90-day notice via UK-based Minerva Trust – the administrator for these companies – addressing him as director of a third company, Sea Bulk Shipping Company Ltd.

The notice conveyed the law firm’s intent to resign as the company’s agent, saying Sea Bulk Shipping did not fulfil “our due diligence requirements”.

Bachchan, however, has denied any link to these companies.

New documents also reveal that while some Indian owners of offshore companies rushed to liquidate their firms, others asked Mossack Fonseca to continue as their agent.

According to Indian Express, some Indian clients went onto increase their holdings:

“Lokesh Sharma, owner of British Virgin Islands-based Mardi Gras Holdings, was one who increased his share capital 30 times in February 2017. While P.R.S. Oberoi resigned as director of J&W Inc, a Bahamas company, in May 2016, Shishir Bajoria, who claimed his name appeared in Mossack Fonseca records due to a clerical mistake, contacted Mossack Fonseca through an intermediary to change the beneficial ownership of Haptic (BVI) Ltd, which was liquidated in May 2016. Ironically, on April 5, 2016, the very day of the global media leak, Mossack Fonseca sent an “assurance” to its subsidiary offices vowing “to make sure intrusions of this nature are prevented from happening in the future.” But within days, emails, full of alarm, poured in, many on behalf of companies owned by Indians.”



The report goes onto detail a May 9, 2016 email received by Mossack Fonseca from PP Shah and Associates, a Mumbai-based accountancy firm, in connection with offshore entity Whitefield Global Investments Ltd, whose beneficiaries are Baroda-based Chirayu Amin and members of his family.

“Huge turbulence is started in the financial world including India. We need to respond to the Indian authorities asap as they have initiated inquiries based on the leaked report and documents which we understand are by and large correct information and documents,” said the email.

In April 2016, the Indian government had announced a probe by a Multi Agency Group on the very day the media reported on leaked Panama Papers.

According to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) – which is heading the probe – all 426 Indians named in the Panama Papers have been put under the scanner and Rs 1,088 crore ($162.4 million) of undisclosed income has been detected as of June 2018.

Tax authorities continue to take action against those named in the Panama Papers and searches and surveys have been conducted in 58 cases as of November 2017.

As recently as June 13, three Delhi-based owners of entities were a subject of early-morning simultaneous searches. They are Devesh Bahl and Rajeev Vaid (Pythhos Technology); Mohit Jain (Om Metals SPRL Limited) and Gurpal Singh Khurana (Top India Limited). All these companies are registered in British Virgin Islands, a tax haven.

Around the time the Panama Papers uncovered the secret world of Mossack Fonseca, offshore companies linked to the Bijli family continued to do business with the Panamanian law firm. A pioneer in multiplex cinemas in India, Ajay Bijli, along with wife Selena and son Aamer, beneficially owned an offshore company set up to hold a property in the UK.

Further, on July 3, 2016, Chesterfield Mayfair Holdings submitted the mandatory source of funds declaration form to Mossack Fonseca and it recorded Ajay, Selena and Aamer Bijli, at the family’s Delhi (Karol Bagh) address, as the beneficial owners of the company which is funded by their personal savings, proceeds from business and trade and proceeds from inheritance or trust funds.

Copies of the Indian passport, PAN card and bank statement of Ajay Bijli and the British passports of Celina and Aamer were among the documents provided to Mossack Fonseca as part of due diligence records.

A spokesperson for Ajay Bijli said: “The purpose of the incorporation of this company is to carry out some private investments in the overseas market. All these investments have been made in accordance with the applicable Indian and International laws and with full and complete disclosure to Regulatory Authorities including Reserve Bank of India and Income Tax.”

Three weeks before the Panama Papers were published in April 2016, internal email exchanges in Mossack Fonseca revealed names of ultimate beneficial owners of some previously registered companies, new records show.

Among them is KBM Global Limited, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands by Mossack Fonseca in December 2008. Email exchanges between March 16 and March 17, 2016, show that the beneficial owner of the company is Kavin Bharti Mittal. His Amrita Shergill Marg, New Delhi address is mentioned in the email exchanges where the name of the beneficial owner has been inserted.

Kavin Bharti Mittal is a British citizen by birth and an Overseas Citizen of India. In a statement to the media, the company notes that Mittal became a tax resident in India on account of his presence to manage a tech start-up from the financial year 2011-12 and accordingly, the tax returns filed with the tax authorities provide full disclosure and details about his ownership of KBM Global Limited.

Jalaj Ashwin Dani stepped down from his position of eminence in Asian Paints in April 2017, after 18 years in the family trade.

Several documents link Dani and his wife Vita Dani to a British Virgin Islands-based entity called Poinsettia Group Holdings Limited. Dani is currently listed as being on the board of 38 Indian companies while his wife is on the board of nine companies and chairperson of 11Sports, a sports management company.

Mossack Fonseca announced in March this year that it was shutting down due to the economic and reputational damage inflicted by its role in the global tax evasion debacle."
A Look Back At A Pioneering Indian Editor,https://m.thewire.in/article/books/sn-ghosh-pioneer-editor-book-review-shankar-ghosh,"Aug 14, 2018  |  Malini Parthasarathy","As Indians justly proud of our inheritance of a robust democracy, a strong set of liberal values and a free press, we take pride in the narratives of our birth as a nation, and acknowledge the tremendous contribution of our nationalist newspapers, vernacular and English. It was the nationalist press that aided the freedom struggle by adding idealism, enthusiasm, drama and vivid imagery to the Non-Cooperation Movement, the Quit India agitation and finally Independence. By turning these political events into moments of celebration, our national imagination was enriched and strengthened.

The set of democratic values that India’s constitution-makers embedded in the constitution included freedom of expression, thereby enabling a free press. This fortunate legacy has provided generous scope for the media in India to fulfil its responsibility in upholding democratic values and ensuring the citizen – the republic’s primary stakeholder – is well served by the set of governing institutions that have been thoughtfully put in place.

It is a matter of regret that today, most of the media, save for a few honourable exceptions, have preferred to forfeit this fundamental right, and have become craven conscripts in a dangerous political project that seeks to alter India’s pluralist national vision into a Hindu nationalist one. As is well known, the strategy of the Hindu nationalist project includes blatant attempts to manipulate and rewrite India’s history. The aim is to wipe out of our collective historical memory, the major figures who have loomed large in our historical imagination of preceding centuries of India’s rich and colourful past. All this is to ensure that these inconvenient facts do not intrude on the narrative of a Hindu nation.

This is precisely why we need narratives and counter-narratives to ensure our remembrances of our past are as multi-faceted and authentic as possible, and to tell us how we got here as an independent nation. We cannot afford one-sided accounts, however appealing to our imagination they might be.

The prevailing narrative about the Indian media is weighted heavily in favour of the Indian-owned and edited nationalist press, which was a vigorous participant in the national struggle for freedom. In independent India, this legacy has helped the Indian media take its rightful place as a stakeholder in India’s democracy.

As we resist the self-serving politically driven attempts to rewrite our history and erase our pluralist past, we should also acknowledge that in writing our own media history, we have not paid enough attention to an entire branch of the press that existed before Independence and played an important role in public discourse, reflecting British colonial interests at first, but later a clutch of land-owners and business magnates. The Indian press is one of the oldest in the world and that relative antiquity owes more to the fact that under British colonial rule, the first newspapers in public circulation were owned by colonial businessmen and edited by Britishers. Newspapers like the Times of India, the Statesman and the Pioneer, owned by British corporate groups and run by British editors, were influential voices in the public discourse in the years before Independence.

There has been virtually no scrutiny or documentation of the British-led newspapers that are an intrinsic part of India’s media history. It is remarkable that the British-led press, alongside the nationalist press, held their space in a rapidly changing political environment in the tumultuous years leading up to Independence. More striking is that these papers managed the transition from British colonial rule to Independence and have survived as significant voices today. The dearth of narratives on the British-edited press reflects an inexplicable and inexcusable gap in our historical understanding of the rise and growth of the press in India.

Given that we need to urgently illuminate what is clearly a dark area in the history of the Indian press, a new biography of S.N Ghosh, the first Indian editor of the Pioneer – a British-owned and edited paper that had Rudyard Kipling on its rolls and Winston Churchill as a war correspondent – is a welcome perspective.

Scent of a Story: A Newspaperman’s Journey is a biography of Surendra Nath Ghosh who joined the Pioneer as a cub reporter in 1927 and was its editor from1946 to 1972, ending his association with the newspaper, only in the 1980s. Written by his son, Shankar Ghosh, this book – which chronicles for the most part S.N. Ghosh’s long decades at the Pioneer – has the promise of providing a new perspective on journalism in the twilight of British colonial rule.

The biography is written in first-person, in the voice of S.N. Ghosh, based on the author’s recollections derived from his father. The result is a rambling and disjointed account.

Ghosh’s journey from cub reporter to editor is indeed a fascinating story to tell. It is after all a story of the complexities that an Indian journalist would have had to face in a work environment where British editors were continuing to direct the narration of increasingly volatile political events, as nationalist sentiment was intensifying by the day. Clearly, journalists like Ghosh would have found it far more difficult than their counterparts in papers helmed by Indian nationalist editors. They had the additional burden of having to negotiate the slippery terrain of maintaining their own intellectual integrity and sense of national pride while balancing their required loyalty to newspapers run by the British establishment.

S.N. Ghosh’s story is also the story of the Pioneer, India’s second oldest newspaper. Started in Allahabad in 1865 by George Allen – a British businessman in Kanpur whose chief distinction was mentoring the famous Rudyard Kipling – the Pioneer is itself a fascinating case study of an enterprise emerging under British colonial rule, finding its voice in the swiftly changing political times and managing to survive the transition to Independence as an Indian-owned and edited newspaper.

Therefore, this account by Shankar Ghosh of the life and career of his father is timely, offering as it does glimpses of the atmosphere and sense of those challenging times.

Yet this book which promises much, given that it could help illuminate a less known part of our journalistic history, does not live up to its potential. The biography is written in first-person, in the voice of S.N. Ghosh, based on the author’s recollections derived from his father. The result is a rambling and disjointed account, often lacking focus that does not provide for a vivid portrait of Ghosh and his times. Why the author chose to adopt this clumsy literary technique is baffling as it confuses the reader. Possibly trying to produce a ‘memoir’ as authentic as possible and relying on his own recollections, the author says he has decided to voice the narrative “in my father’s words as that is how I remember most of the incidents”.

This is a short-sighted literary technique as it compromises the detailing of the larger picture of Ghosh’s evolution as a journalist and of his intellectual profile. The first few chapters present a rambling and disjointed narrative which dwell on obscure anecdotes about family, childhood and other relatives. These anecdotes lack edge and are jumbled up with vignettes of Ghosh at his workplace, encountering various larger-than-life personalities.

What is unfortunate is that this narration by the author of his own father’s life and times, assuming his father’s voice, does not contain enough information about Ghosh’s own political views, which are required to illuminate more clearly his role as the first Indian editor of an Anglo-Indian daily at a very pivotal moment of Indian history.

Emerging from Shankar Ghosh’s narrative is a picture of a line of doughty British editors, from Edwin Howard and F.W. Wilson to Desmond Young, under whom the young S.N. Ghosh learnt his trade and managed to keep his spirits up. The interesting takeaways that emerge are of the British editors and their Indian proteges becoming increasingly conflicted between their loyalties to the British establishment and their journalistic duty to capture the true essence of the political turbulence and the ascendancy of nationalist sentiment. As recounted by his son in S.N. Ghosh’s voice, when the Pioneer was helmed by British editors, the paper sought to increase its circulation by wild swings from “the Kipling-esque White Man’s Burden and Churchillian Pax Brittanica …to writings considered bordering on Bolshevik”

This disconcerting style that runs through Shankar Ghosh’s memoir, robs the narration of his father’s encounters with major personalities such as Motilal Nehru and Govind Ballabh Pant of all gravitas. Perhaps unintended, the result of this story-telling technique is to reduce these leading political figures to caricatures. For instance, on Pant, the author, speaking as his father, says, “In time, I was a patient ear to Pant Ji and got many scoops—not that I published everything for that would be malicious and betrayal of trust.” Pant was “afflicted”, according to S.N. Ghosh, “with ‘essential tremor’ (the involuntary shaking of the head) brought about by British lathis and if he decided to say no, an extended look coupled with shaking of the head conveyed his feelings without having to say anything”.

A rich moment like becoming the first ever Indian to edit the Pioneer is wasted and reduced to prosaic descriptions of material details of the family’s consequent social and material elevation. Rather than highlighting the significance of this path-breaking appointment of S.N. Ghosh as editor in the larger national context, the author launches into rapturous descriptions of the editor’s work desk inherited from a British predecessor which “had drawer knobs of Burma teak”. He waxes eloquent on the editor’s flat which had an ambience that “lent its occupant a certain status and princes, politicians, VIPs and other visitors all felt at home and importantly, in a mood to share confidences”.

Disappointing too is the lack of focus on S.N. Ghosh’s privileged position as editor in the run-up to Independence. While the author dwells in detail on his father’s loyal attempts to keep the Pioneer financially afloat by using his political contacts to get the Jaipurias of Kanpur to buy the paper, he is unable to provide a perspective of Ghosh as editor at a crucial period in India’s coming of age as an independent nation. The memoir fails to live up to its purpose of presenting S.N. Ghosh as the Pioneer’s first Indian editor in a ring-side seat, witness to exciting moments in India’s modern history. Ghosh had a long sojourn at the helm of the newspaper, and to his credit he kept the Pioneer anchored to liberal values which it was till many decades later, for which history would remember him kindly.

But for all its clumsiness of story-telling, the memoir is an earnest attempt to tell the other side of the story of the antecedents of Indian journalism. It is also a timely reminder of our collective duty as journalists to ensure the historical truth be upheld in all its shades, including the grey. More research and biographies need to be written on the journalism on the “other side” of the national struggle as it would aid our understanding of our great journey and the sacrifices made by our forbears in ensuring the rich legacy of democratic values and human rights that we have today.

"Should the Stilwell Road Between India, Myanmar and China be Restored?",https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/india-myanmar-china-stilwell-road-restored,"Oct 13, 2016  |  Mirza Zulfiqur Rahman","The Pangsau Pass between Burma and India illustrates the complex issue of borders in the region.

A derelict border crossing steeped in history cuts across the rolling mountain ranges from India to Myanmar. It is at the junction of three distinct geographical regions: the eastern Himalayas; the verdant floodplains fed by the Brahmaputra river; and the Patkai hills. This route meanders towards the Chindwin river, the largest tributary of the Irrawaddy, which defines the plains of Myanmar.

The Pangsau Pass stands at this border crossing between India and Myanmar, bearing witness to waves of migrations over the centuries. Across the Pangsau Pass, in the Sagaing region of present-day Myanmar, lies Pangsau village.

The residents there are a mix of ethnic Bamars, mainly considered Burmese (the dominant ethnic group in Myanmar), ethnic Tangsa Nagas who also inhabit parts of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, and some other Eastern Naga tribes.

The nearest proper town inside Myanmar from the village is about 60km away. It is connected by a dirt road, the old Stilwell Road, which is now almost inaccessible during the rainy season.

At Pangsau Pass, every Friday is designated as “Burma Day”, when the villagers can cross to India. They visit the market in Nampong to buy essential items for the week. Some people cross on foot, others on rickety motorbikes.

Indian citizens are allowed to visit Pangsau village on the 10th, 20th and 30th day of every month, on what are known as “India Days”. Most Indian visitors are tourists and there is a market held in Pangsau village on these days.

The Arunachal Pradesh state government and the local market coordination committee decide on these access days in consultation with the Indian Army, which patrols the border. Pangsau market sells a host of local Burmese products and vegetables, and there are local eateries with Burmese delicacies. These are mostly local leafy vegetables with sticky rice and rice noodle soups.

Burmese sticky rice is very popular among the border communities in India. Many Indian tourists also visit the Lake of No Return, where several Allied Forces’ warplanes crashed during World War II.

Men roam in longyi (male attire), trying to sell their products. Women and children wear bright patches of thanaka on their faces, a yellowish-white cosmetic paste, made from ground bark, a common sight in Myanmar.

The Stilwell Road was constructed under the leadership of General Joseph Stilwell of the US Army between 1942-45. It began in Ledo, Assam and ended in Kunming, in the southwestern province of Yunnan in China, spanning 1,736 kilometres.

This provided an alternative route for Chinese soldiers fighting the invading Japanese during the concluding stages of the war.

The section of the road that links India and Myanmar has been disused ever since the war ended, and is described by the Chinese as “barely useable”.

A propaganda film produced by the American, British and Indian army film units in 1945, narrated by Ronald Reagan.

But the origins of the route go back long before Joseph Stilwell. This was the way Chaolung Sukapha, the first Ahom king, entered the plains of Assam in 1228 AD. He established the Ahom kingdom (1228-1826), which began a period of stability and prosperity in present-day Assam. Several waves of migration happened after that, and they included the six major Tai groups of Assam. The Singphos have also used the route for centuries.The many ethnic groups of the region have this route etched in their collective imaginations. The Tai-Phakey community, which numbers about 2,000 people in Assam, migrated from Hukawng Valley in Myanmar through the Pangsau Pass. They have managed to preserve the old form of Tai language, and medieval scriptures in their Budhhist monastery.

According to several members of the community that I met during fieldwork, they have been able to preserve their cultural and linguistic heritage because the closed borders make them feel isolated from their culture. So they preserve all they have left.

As you approach Ledo, a huge billboard announces the beginning of the Stilwell Road to Kunming, installed by a former Assam minister.

This is indicative of the shared aspirations of the people of this region to open up to Myanmar and southwest China. The Pangsau Pass Winter Festival, held intermittently over the past few years, has also demonstrated strong cultural links across the region.

The main rationale for re-opening the road is connecting people across these shared borders, along with the exchange of ideas and goods. But there is less interest shown by the Indian government.

The presence of several insurgent groups in northeast India deters New Delhi from restoring the road. Some Indian insurgent groups are based across this border in Myanmar, with active cross-border operations. The Kachin insurgency against the Myanmar government is also based there.

China has shown interest in opening up the route, but India’s hesitation is also based on the fact that some part of it involves the contested territory of Arunachal Pradesh. Boundary talks between India and China about the status of Arunachal Pradesh have been going on for years now, with 19 rounds of talks completed in 2016.

It may be complicated, but it is imperative for both New Delhi and Yangon to work towards opening up the road, given China’s continued strategic engagement in the Kachin region of Myanmar.

A joint development of these borderlands, which have historically been hubs of migration and exchange, will augur well for the region as a whole.

"Coronavirus Daily Updates: India’s Cases Near 30,000","https://m.thewire.in/article/health/Coronavirus%20Daily%20Updates:%20India%E2%80%99s%20Cases%20Near%2030,000","Apr 28, 2020  |  The Wire Staff",
"Backstory: When the Senior-Most Judges of India Speak out, Can the Media Afford to Be Left Behind?",https://m.thewire.in/article/law/backstory-senior-judges-india-speak-can-media-afford-left-behind,"Jan 14, 2018  |  Pamela Philipose","A fortnightly column from The Wire’s public editor.

It was an extraordinary recognition of unique role of the media in this country as the crucial bridge to the people of India. When four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court took the route of a press conference on January 12 to express their “great anguish and concern” about the state of affairs within an institution that was the country’s last court of appeal, it was also an acknowledgement that the media, in a way, is also a court of last appeal.

But will the Indian media rise up to this acknowledgement by taking on the challenge of a story that calls into question not just the functioning of the Supreme Court but the resilience of Indian democracy? The fact that it was met in the electronic media with the usual clamour, sometimes extraordinarily unhinged clamour, designed solely to disrupt and divert, is profoundly disappointing. But it shouldn’t surprise us because this is not a made-for-television story. It demands the quietude, careful documentation, archival memory and reasoned assumptions that the print media is naturally best placed to provide. If ever there was an argument to be made for the vital role that the print media plays in the ecology of India’s democratic media, it is this news break about these four dissenting judges.

Indian democracy, it seems, is too fragile a thing to be left to the echo chambers of television studios.

So how is this wake up call to be handled in the days ahead? The first thing the media should watch out for are efforts to upend the narrative, for these will surely come considering the very powerful actors who could feel threatened by this development. Fake news and calumny are already following in the wake of this story, and the days ahead will only bring more bilge.

Keeping the eye on the ball will require a refusal to be distracted by such noise and a close reading of the detailed letter that the four honourable judges have written. The media would do particularly well to critically examine recent judicial orders that have emerged from the Supreme Court over the past months and engage with ongoing hearings as well, because linked to this concern about the lack of transparency in the selection of judges to decide cases, and misgivings over the CJI’s roster management, are a raft of cases that will impact the future in many known and unknown ways.

With the story breaking, The Wire was quick with its capacity for compelling video (‘Watch: Understanding the Implications of the Historic Press Conference by Four Rebel Judges’ , January 12, 2018). There was an effort to catch up with the action in close to real time by generating both news reports and opinion. The writers of the article, ‘Black Day for Judiciary: Legal Fraternity Weighs in on Unprecedented Move by Four SC Judges’ (January 12), for instance, were able to garner a fair share of informed comment from the legal community. They could, however, have avoided referring to one of their interviewees, Aman Lekhi, as being “known for his proximity to the ruling BJP”, since they had not specifically mentioned the political leanings of the others they had spoken to. Perhaps just mentioning that Lekhi was married to BJP MP and spokesperson, Meenakshi Lekhi, would have sufficed. Also the heading did not do justice to the piece. In fact, Kamini Jaiswal, from whose quote the headline was taken, had after expressing distress about the turn of events, had gone on to say that because the judges had spoken out, “at least now the people know what is happening”. Far from being a “black day”, I would say it was the reverse – some sunshine has finally been finally let into the dark chambers of the court.

Where The Wire appears to have done a more comprehensive job than most news media is in tackling what one commentator referred to as the “the elephant in the room – the Judge B.H. Loya case” (‘An Honourable Disagreement Within India’s Highest Court’, January 13). The case is important, he argued, because it “goes to the very core of the judiciary’s role in ensuring that we remain a country governed by the rule of law. When a judge looking into an extremely sensitive case dies in mysterious circumstances, every single judicial functionary is left to draw his/her fearful conclusions.” Ironically, many in the mainstream media appear too fearful to draw any conclusion, and the death of Judge Loya continues to be ignored by mainstream media – apart from some attempts to discredit reportage on it.

In such a scenario, it falls on a platform like The Wire to take a more holistic view of the whole issue. Apart from decent update of the case (‘Death of a Judge: What We Know, What We Don’t Know’, January 12), it also carried a timeline on the almost deliberately forgotten Sohrabuddin elimination, on which Justice Loya was to pronounce before his untimely death (‘Sohrabuddin Fake Encounter Case: A Timeline of Events’, January 12). There was also an important interview with one of the editors of The Caravan, the magazine that had broken the story on Justice Loya’s death (‘Watch: What Does the SC Judges’ Statement Mean for the Judge Loya Case?’), and who pulled no punches in accusing every institution, from the police to the media, for having failed this case.

All this recalls the words of another Supreme Court judge, H.R. Khanna, who too was tested in another era for daring to deliver a dissenting judgment on a politically fraught case – Additional District Magistrate of Jabalpur vs Shiv Kant Shukla – by being superseded for the post of chief justice of the Supreme Court. In his book, Making of India’s Constitution, Justice Khanna wrote, “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty and in the final analysis, its only keepers are the people. Imbecility of men, history teaches us, always invites the impudence of power.”

If the media is to perform its function as the main instrument for that eternal vigilance of the people, it will have to call out the “impudence of power” – and this story about four judges and a press conference is nothing if it is not about the impudence of power and the need to expose it.

Indian Science's #MeToo Moment Remains Caged in Lattice of Lopsided Relations,https://m.thewire.in/article/education/indian-sciences-metoo-moment-remains-caged-in-lattice-of-lopsided-relations,"Oct 10, 2018  |  Aswin Sekhar","At the International Astronomical Union General Assembly, the largest astronomy and astrophysics conference, held at Vienna a month ago, there were few references about dealing with sexual harassment issues in the research community and wider academia in general.

This issue has been met with cold silence in Indian academic circles. Most institutes or universities try brush things under the carpet when it comes to discussing this in the open. Many scientists worry that their valued research collaborations will be broken, that their friends and peers will get offended and/or that they will annoy powerful male scientists presiding over important councils and committees.

At the same time, there are plenty of private conversations happening among professional scientists and professors, similar to whisper networks in the Indian media and the film industry.

“Any discussion or comment on this topic is still a very touchy issue in Indian circles and we ourselves could land up in trouble because of reporting things openly,” said a senior female astronomer from India who wished to remain unnamed. Some female scientists say that they are ostracised by their senior male colleagues if they discuss sexual harassment in academia openly in meetings or forums. Such is the nature of this beast.

“We have put forward a proposal to the three national science academies in India to come up with a self-declaration from members that they have never been involved or convicted of sexual harassment,” another senior female astrophysicist said on condition of anonymity. “Because the members of these academies carry great prestige and power, this is one way to ensure some responsibility and justice in this regard.”

We need measures to weed out people with track-records of sexual misconduct and sexism, and keep them from being nominated for prestigious positions and awards in future.

One hopes that in the long run, such measures will slowly weed out people with track-records of sexual misconduct and sexism, and keep them from being nominated for prestigious positions and awards in future. This is a good step in the right direction.

But the trouble remains that some sub-committees dealing with gender-related complaints in Indian institutions aren’t constituted with members who are active or vocal on this issue. Most members selected for such roles tend to be dormant and malleable, apart from not having been properly trained. Even if they do make a formal observation, it is quickly buried under suspicion and stigma. This leads to an environment of constant fear and doubt among younger scientists who might wish to lodge a complaint against a senior or powerful figure in the research community.

We need to ensure that male scientists with a record of sexual misconduct of any kind should not be allowed to guide or supervise female PhD students or postdoctoral fellows. These relationships – between advisors and students – are fertile grounds for exercising power and for harassment, and should not be allowed to exist without procedures and systems that empower the students and make sure offending advisors are always acted against without damaging the students’ prospects in any way.

Further, in most top research institutions and central universities, there are internal committees and panels on record that are authorised to investigate such matters. However, it is not infrequently the case that students don’t know whom to approach as a first point of contact for addressing grievances and redressal. There are many junior and senior research fellows who find these channels to be inaccessible for practical purposes as a result.

In non-‘top-tier’ institutions, such panels often don’t even exist despite numerous central government directives and recommendations on this matter. Further, the availability of points of contact, leave alone their rights to one, are neither advertised nor displayed on websites, notice boards or in in-house publications. Most people are clueless about how best to deal with this internal problem.

On the other hand, whisper networks among students of all genders often clearly note male supervisors and guides in India who try to make unwanted sexual advances, make inappropriate gender-specific comments, policing or shaming comments, etc.

At the same time, because the future of many female students depends on the mercy of a few male supervisors during their PhD studies, they find it almost impossible to fight back against their situation. Although the complicity of other men would be difficult to defend, it must be noted that male PhD students are also passively browbeaten into silence because they are similarly vulnerable to having their programme disturbed or derailed by speaking up against their supervisors.

When journalists try to discuss this topic in conferences or meetings with scientists in India, they are faced with silence. Most male scientists simply try to change topic when they are asked to clarify the redressal systems in place. This is not helping anyone, least of all the students we all have a responsibility to protect.

India’s research community and academic institutions should consider setting up an ombudsman body composed of respected female scientists and academics from different parts of the country who can recommend possible ways in which to tackle this silent yet corrosive issue within the Indian research system.

Fact Check on Jaitley the Fact-Checker Paints Unflattering Picture of Economy,https://m.thewire.in/article/macro/arun-jaitley-rahul-gandhi-fact-check-india-economy,"Jun 07, 2018  |  The Wire Analysis","New Delhi: In a note posted on Facebook on Wednesday, senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley accused Rahul Gandhi of being ‘liberal’ with the facts in the speech that the Congress president delivered in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh.

In a point-by-point rebuttal, Jaitley offered counter facts. But to what extent do the counter-arguments hold up? The Wire breaks it down and examines how in this debate, the core issues that should concern voters have been obfuscated.

1) Rahul Gandhi accused the Centre of waiving off Rs 1.5 lakh crore worth of loans of 15 industrialists. Jaitley responded by saying, “The Government has not waived of [sic] a single rupee due from any industrialist. The facts are to the contrary. Those who owed money to the banks and other creditors have been declared insolvent and removed from their companies by IBC enacted by Prime Minister Modi’s Government. These loans were given largely during the UPA Government.”

Technically, Jaitley is right in saying that the government has not ‘waived off’ loans of any industrialist.

However, the Narendra Modi government told parliament in April this year that between April 2014 and December 2017, public sector banks (PSBs) wrote off Rs 2,72,558 crore worth of loans.

While a write-off is not the same as a loan waiver, as the loan still remains receivable, the rate of recovery of loans that have been written off is not something that the former finance minister would be too proud of.

Public sector banks recovered Rs 29,343 crore – a mere 10.7% – of the loans that had been written off in the three-year period.

Jaitley also pointed to the efforts of ‘Prime Minister Modi’s government’ in recovering money through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). However, according to recent reports in The Business Standard, the performance of the IBC has been far from satisfactory. Of the cases that were admitted under the IBC, only 1.9% were resolved till December 2017.

The reports also show that in 37 big cases where a principal amount of Rs 4 trillion is owed, banks are estimated to recover only Rs 1.7 trillion.

This makes the recovery rate of bad loans in these cases a mere 43%, a figure Jaitley would want to better. And the figure itself could be an overestimate as it deals only with the principal amount and does not take into account the other unpaid dues and charges. A sector analysis also showed that the rate of recovery of loans could slow down even further.

2) Jaitley in his note quoted Gandhi as saying ‘Loans are not available to the kisans but only to the industrialists’. Jaitley’s defence stated, “Factually false. This was during the UPA Government, particularly UPA II, when bulk of amount constitute the NPA’s today were given by the banking system during the period 2008-14. From 2014 we have been systematically taking one step after the other to recover these monies back.”

Jaitley does not respond to the main thrust of the argument made by Rahul Gandhi.

However, on Gandhi’s point that banks have a propensity to avoid lending to farmers, there is data to point that the share of credit extended to the agriculture sector remains low. According to a report in Mint, in 2016-17, agriculture accounted for 13.91% of the total outstanding credit, while industries accounted for 37.3%. Industries and services put together accounted for 63.34%.

Further, according to a report in The Hindu, credit to the agriculture sector saw a contraction in growth. Agri credit grew only at 3.8% for the year ended March 2018, as compared to 12.4% for the year ended March 2017.

RBI data has also shown that the farm sector performs better when it comes to repayment of loans as compared to the industries sector. In fiscal 2017, the agriculture sector defaulted on 6% of its total credit, while the industry sector defaulted on 20%.

3) In his speech, Rahul Gandhi reportedly said that the prime Minister has given Rs.35000 crores each to two diamond jewellers who have now escaped out of country. Jaitley responded by stating that Gandhi’s claims were “factually false” and that the “banking fraud started in the year 2011 when the UPA II was in power. It was only detected during the NDA period”.

Rahul is in the wrong here. Stating that the prime minister himself gave Rs 35,000 crore to diamond merchants Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi is obviously false and hyperbolic.

The larger point that both politicians are looking to avoid is that both the UPA and NDA governments must share blame for the Nirav Modi scam. As Jaitley notes, it’s true that the letter of undertaking (LoU) fraud started in 2011. What he leaves out is that the size of the fraud, the bulk of it actually, deeply accelerated in 2017.

On potentially preventing the Rs 13,000 crore fraud, as The Wire has extensively reported and analysed, both the UPA and NDA-II governments are at fault. As M.K. Venu has noted, the years 2013 and 2017 are key to understanding how the Punjab National Bank scam played out.

The Modi government has also been left looking a little more red-faced as the scam wasn’t detected in time to prevent Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi from leaving the country. To add salt to the injury, whistleblower complaints to the PMO and Jaitley’s own ministry were ignored. Nirav Modi was also part of the India CEO meet organised by the Modi government in Davos, one week before the scam broke.

4) What Rahul said: “If the Congress comes to power mobile phones, which are made in China, will now be manufactured in India”. What Jaitley said: A case of inadequate knowledge. In the year 2014 when UPA went out of power, there were only two mobile phone manufacturing units in India. In 2018, with the result of our electronics policy and the incentives in a four year period, this has increased to 120 units with an investment of Rs.1,32,000 crores.

Jaitley misses the larger point and gets one of his facts wrong. While the number of mobile phone plants set up in India has indeed increased sharply (from less than five in 2014 to over 100 in 2018), most of these ‘manufacturing units’ are largely assembly centres, where workers put together sophisticated components that are imported from China and other South-East Asian countries.

A 2016 study by IIM-Bangalore and Counterpoint Research found that the current contribution of locally sourced (or Made in India) components and sub-components accounted for just 6% of total value of components that go into a phone, a fact that the study calls “economically unfortunate”.

For instance, in 2015, the total value of mobile phones sold in India was around $11.5 billion. Out of that, the “true local value addition generated in local component sourcing and local assembly will be close to $650 million”, according to the IIM-Counterpoint study.

This ‘manufacturing versus assembly’ debate ties into Jaitley’s second point, which is that 120 units have been set up with an investment of “Rs 1,32,000 crores”.

This investment statistic is false.

The Rs 1.32 lakh crore figure that the former finance minister refers to can be traced back to a statement made by IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in April 2018. At the time, the IT minister noted that India’s mobile manufacturing industry would touch Rs 1,32,000 crore by the end of 2018, up from over Rs 90,000 crore at the end of 2017.

The figure that Prasad is referring to here is the total value of mobile phones produced (read: assembled) in India and not the quantum of investment that went into setting up those plants.

Mobile phone units that engage primarily in assembly and not manufacturing require less investment. While we don’t know the current level of investment that has gone into setting up the over 100 new units, an estimate from 2016 noted that the 50 new mobile manufacturing facilities that had been set up from 2014 were brought up with a “combined capex of close to Rs 1,700 crore or $267 million”.

Even assuming a higher-end projection, it seems unlikely that the remaining 70 units were set up with more than Rs 10,000 crore in investment. Jaitley’s Rs 1.32 lakh crore figure, therefore, is more likely the the total value of mobile phones that are assembled at these 120 plants.

5) What Rahul said: Jobs not being created in India What Jaitley said: The latest GDP data has re-emphasised India as the fastest growing economy in the world.There is a double digit growth in construction, expansion in manufacturing, an increased capital formation which indicates investment increase, large investment in physical infrastructure and increased investment in rural India. All these are job creating sectors.

The senior BJP leader obfuscates the subject again. Yes, it’s true that India’s GDP growth is on the rise again – although Jaitley ignores the debate over deflators and the fact that demonetisation and GST was what slowed growth down considerably in 2016 and 2017. It is also true this rise has been led by a spurt in the manufacturing and construction sectors.

The second part is where his argument is weak – that this GDP growth has automatically resulted in abundant high-quality jobs.

The phenomenon of jobless growth has been a hotly debated subject over the last two years.

For instance, we know that anywhere between 10 to 12 million graduates hit the job market in India every year. But, as The Wire has reported and documented, nobody seems to agree on how many jobs are being created.

Consider a recent debate. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a well-respected think-tank, insists that India added just 1.43 million jobs in 2017. The think-tank was countering claims put forth by senior economist Surjit Bhalla, also a member of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, who reckons that it could be over 15 million. The government’s own think-tank, the NITI Aayog, appears to have taken a middle path with claims of seven million jobs being created in 2017.

Much of this debate centres around vital, if arcane, quibbling over methodological issues and how well India’s policy-makers are able to capture job creation in the informal sector. On one thing most people appear to agree is that even if India is creating an adequate number of jobs, they are likely poor-quality jobs, giving rise to the certainty that under-employment certain afflicts vast swathes of the country.

This debate will also be hopefully more informed later this year when the labour ministry’s attempts at counting jobs created in the informal economy (at establishments who deploy less than 10 people) start bearing fruit.

Until then, Jaitley’s claims of adequate job creation, vis-à-vis higher GDP growth, need to be taken with a pinch of salt."

"India, Russia Look to Massive Defence Deals to Bring Back that Loving Feeling",https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/india-russia-look-massive-defence-deals-bring-back-loving-feeling,"Oct 15, 2016  |  Anuj Srivas","From Kamov helicopters to Admiral Grigorovich-class stealth frigates, deals adding up to nearly $7 billion are expected to be signed.

New Delhi/Goa: Indian government officials are hoping that this week’s BRICS summit in Goa will not only serve as a platform to wrap up a year’s worth of negotiations on a number of big-ticket defence deals but also firmly reaffirm Moscow and New Delhi’s historically strong defence partnership.

Defence purchases, adding up to anywhere between $5 billion to $7 billion, will be announced on Saturday and Sunday, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the matter.

While relations between Russia and India have been listless over the last year, mostly due to larger geopolitical stakes, Indian defence ministry officials insist that the deals that will be announced over the weekend represent ultimately a future investment in the Indo-Russian defence relationship.

“Even within the defence relationship of course there have been minor cracks. This weekend is not only about agreeing to big purchases and signing multi-year deals. For instance, one sore point ever since Parikkar took over was regarding the poor conditions of the Sukhoi fighter aircraft and their maintenance. At any given point of time, 30%-50% of the Sukhoi fleet is not operational due to maintenance issues. Spare parts and servicing have been bones of contention and this weekend, a creative arrangement is expected to be announced,” a senior defence analyst, who declined to be identified, told The Wire.

Russia, on its part, has been equally eager. Two massive defence deals were confirmed in advance by the Russian side yesterday evening: The first is the purchase of the S-400 LRSAM anti-aircraft missile systems (a $4.5-billion inter-government agreement that has been long in the works, but was officially announced by the Kremlin Thursday night). The second, which was announced by the Rostec State Corporation, was a (reportedly $1.5-billion) “contract for export and joint production for 200 Kamov-226T helicopters.

The final touches to these two defence acquisitions, according to sources, took place at the meeting of a joint-working group (JWG) on Indo-Russian military-technical cooperation, which took place in New Delhi in early September. The meeting was largely centred around expediting some of the bigger defence purchases, some of which had stalled for a number of last-minute reasons.

“The JWG meeting also came at quite a crucial time. The LEMOA pact with the US had just been officially signed and there was the issue of Russia potentially conducting its first-ever military exercise with Pakistan later that month,” a defence ministry official, who was privy to some of the discussions, told The Wire.

At a press conference in Goa on Friday, Indian ambassador to Russia Pankaj Saran pointed out that it would be unfair to view the Indo-Russian relationship ony through the prism of the recent Russian-Pakistan military exercises.

“I don’t think it is fair to reduce the relationship which has developed over decades to an incident which took place few days ago,” Saran said.

Indeed, as industry experts and officials point out, the larger circumstances surrounding the Indo-Russian relationship had very little impact on the countries’ defence partnership. The deal themselves have been stalled or had a few obstacles due to budgetary concerns, ‘Make-in-India’ pressures, technology transfer issues and work-share agreements.

Nevertheless, what’s on the military menu, which deals’ details still need to be sorted and what concerns remain?

Kamov helicopter deal

The need to acquire, develop or jointly produce a new fleet of light utility helicopters has been floating around for a number of years. Multiple estimates show that India needs around 800 light choppers to replace the ageing Cheetah/Chetak fleet. The Russian deal for 200 Ka 226 helicopters, first announced in May 2015, represents therefore the first major line of helicopters that will replace the old guard.

According to industry sources, the Kamov helicopter deal was delayed initially due to a number of unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles and then later due to pressures from the Indian side over co-production and technology transfer possibilities.

“From May-June to October, there was usual back-and-forth over sending specifications and deciding on technical issues. From October to December however curiously the Russian side announced intentions to form joint ventures with a number of Indian private players, but ended up junking that plan in the end,” an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter said.

“First there was the potential venture with the Guragon-based Sun Group, which was scrapped. Then a letter of intention was sent by the Russian side to form a subsidiary with Reliance Infrastructure, tentatively called Reliance Helicopters. Then finally in January 2016, a few months after Modi’s visit to Moscow, Rostec settled on HAL as a potential partner.”

The Rostec statement released on Thursday doesn’t identify who the India partner will be but states that a “joint production facility” would be set up and that a “long-term contract for after-sales servicing of Russian-made helicopters” was currently under negotiations.

“The helicopter deal is massive for India, it is a proper joint co-production programme. It also, in letter and spirit, endorses the Make in India project as Rostec will look to export the choppers from its India facility eventually. The only stickler point for India was that the first batch of copters may be off-the-shelf,” said Anand Bhatia, a defence analyst.

S-400 missiles deal

The anti-aircraft missile deal, some military observers say, has the potential to be one of the largest ever deals between Russia and India (at least until the details surrounding the fifth-generation fighter aircraft are sorted).

The missile systems were pitched to India over a year ago and approval for the purchase was given by Parikkar and the defence acquisitions council back in December 2015. However, in May 2016, media reports suggested that the deal was going through a number of budgetary obstacles.

Defence News quoted at the time anonymous defence ministry officials who said that the S400 deal would be postponed primarily because “after the global buy of $8.9 billion for Rafale fighers, $1.5 billion for very short range air defense man-portable systems and $1.5 billion in short-range surface-to-air missile systems… there is no money for other foreign purchases,”

Multiple sources told The Wire that slightly cheaper Rafale deal and Parikkar’s tapping into PSU advance payments cleared a majority of these concerns.

“At the end of the day, it’s an anti-aircraft missile system. These things are not cheap. And if you look at it from another perspective, what is the cost if something gets through India’s airspace borders?,” said Rahul Gangal, a partner at Roland-Berger, a defence consulting firm.

What else?

What has not yet been officially confirmed, but has been heavily rumoured in the run-up to the BRICS summit and has been mentioned in earlier Indo-Russian meetings, is the deal for four Admiral Grigorovich-class steal frigates and the groundwork for the much-vaunted “fifth generation fighter aircraft (FGFA)” which is being jointly developed by both countries.

“Nobody at the moment is expecting an agreement for the FGFA to be signed. There are too many details left and over the last four months there have been a number of disagreements over the work-share composition. However, an initial framework agreement could likely be signed,” a senior industry source said.

The Pak factor

Ahead of the 17th bilateral summit, Indian officials indicated that Prime Minister Modi is likely to take up the issue of Russia’s defence relationship with Pakistan.

“Where there are issues of interest to either India or Russia, I imagine that it will be discussed,” said Indian ambassador to Russia, Pankaj Saran in answer to a query if Modi was likely to himself press the issue in light of India’s recent hardline position on cross-border terrorism.

Russia and Pakistan recently held their first army exercise a few days after the attack on the Indian army brigade headquarters in Uri. India had blamed Pakistan for being behind the attack. While the exercise was pre-scheduled much earlier, India had objected after the Russian defence ministry had first claimed that the exercise would be held in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This was later denied by Russia.

Saran, however, tried to make a difference between this wrinkle – and the greater arc of the Indo-Russian partnership.

“I don’t think it is fair to reduce the relationship which has developed over decades to an incident which took place few days ago,” he said.

He added that India had “conveyed our concerns and views to the Russian side”. “We are confident that Russia will reflect on our concerns and that is where we stand now”.

Describing Russia as a “world power” which also has “legitimate interests in Asia-Pacific”, Saran said that there will certainly be discussion on global issues like Syria.

“There are trouble spots. There are some in which Russia has stakes, while in others India has a role,” said Saran.

Putin arrives in Goa at 1 a.m and will check into the presidential suite at Taj Exotica. The bilateral summit will begin with restricted talks between Modi and Putin, followed by an hour of full-delegation level discussions. At around 1.05, there will be an exchange of agreements and a live video link to the foundation laying ceremony for units 3 and 4 of Kudankulam nuclear power plant.

“In the course of last 12 months, several indian companies concluded deals with Rosneft and some other Russian companies. Tomorrow I expect to have some more agreements that will be announced after the summit between Russian majors and some indian companies,” said Saran.

When asked about defence deals which will be signed, he refused to comment.

"Implement SC Order, India Tells Maldives, as Release of Political Prisoners is Delayed",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/implement-sc-order-india-tells-maldives-release-political-prisoners-delayed,"Feb 03, 2018  |  The Wire Staff","The Yameen administration has said there are contradictions in a recent judicial ruling that calls for the immediate release of nine political prisoners, including the country’s former president Mohamed Nasheed.

New Delhi: With Maldivian president Abdulla Yameen’s administration expressing “concern” over a recent judicial ruling, India on Friday called on the island nation’s government to “respect and abide” by the Maldives supreme court ruling on February 1 that mandated the release of all the country’s political prisoners.

The Indian statement was issued by the Ministry of External Affairs about 16 hours after Maldives supreme court issued its surprising order that has kicked off a political commotion.

“We have seen last night’s order of the Supreme Court of Maldives releasing all political prisoners. In the spirit of democracy and rule of law, it is imperative for all organs of the Government of Maldives to respect and abide by the order of the apex court,” said the MEA press release.

Following the Supreme Court’s decision, the Maldives government has yet to take any concrete steps towards the implementation, with the president’s office asserting that there were contradictions in the judgement.

On Friday, the country’s attorney general Mohamed Anil met with the chief justice Abdullah Saeed to “raise concerns” over the ruling and “highlighted concerns” over the consequences of the implementation.

The government continues to claim that it will implement the order, but the rider being that it has to be “within due process”.

The country’s top legal officer also stated that the Prosecutor General has been asked to give his recommendations on “best way to proceed with the implementation of the Supreme Court’s ruling”. The prosecutor general’s office issued a statement that it was preparing “to submit details of the legal and judicial concerns it has to the Supreme Court”.

The supreme court order had called for the immediate release of nine political prisoners, including former president Mohamed Nasheed, who is currently in self-exile abroad. The top court also annulled its July 2017 order, which effectively restored the seats of 12 former ruling party MPs who had defected to the opposition benches.

The order also removed any supervisory role by other state bodies over the Supreme Court and urged the prosecutor general to charge individuals who do not allow for the implementation of the ruling.

Local media reported that clashes and protests broke out on the streets of Maldives on Friday as special operation police officers dispersed celebrating opposition supporters from the streets with tear-gas and arrests. The opposition’s supporters were back on the street after Friday evening prayers

The Supreme Court’s Thursday night judgment was a surprise to many in the opposition, especially since the judiciary had been seen to be compromised by the government. The higher judicial officers were seen to be opposed to Nasheed, as he had arrested the chief criminal court judge in the last months of his presidency.

According to diplomatic sources, there were signs in the last few weeks that the Supreme Court was a divided house, with the Chief Justice being upset with the repeated use of the judiciary by President Yameen.

In the official response, India also called on the government ensure that safety and security of Indian nationals in Maldives “under all circumstances” and noted that it was keeping an eye on the Indian ocean neighbour.

“As a close and friendly neighbour, India wishes to see a stable, peaceful and prosperous Maldives. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” said the press note.

Maldives opposition leaders welcomed India’s unambiguous backing for the Supreme Court, with former dictator and opposition leader Maumoon Abdul Gayoom terming it as a “helpful statement”.

Thank you India ?? @narendramodi for your most helpful statement welcoming the Supreme Court decision and calling on our authorities to comply with it in the spirit of democracy, good governance & rule of law. — Maumoon Abdul Gayoom (@maumoonagayoom) February 2, 2018

MDP international spokesperson, Hamid Abdul Ghafoor told The Wire that former President Nasheed also “welcomed” the Indian statement. “He is also suggesting India should consider more robust measures to ensure President Yameen complies (with the SC order),” Ghafoor said.

In a statement, Nasheed not only asked for the implementation of the supreme court order, but also for the creation of an atmosphere that allowed for an inclusive election.

“We are moving towards elections. I can contest and will contest. We must set up proper procedures for inclusive, free and fair elections with full international observation,” he said.

Following the order, Nasheed had told a local TV channel that he would return to Maldives soon, but the timing of the decision will be based on consultations with the opposition alliance.

India’s forthright advice to implement the supreme court order is a shift from previous statements, where it had remained more publicly ambiguous.

There had been some friction between India and Maldives over the latter’s signing of a free trade agreement with China. However, the visit of the Maldives foreign minister Mohamed Asim had papered over the differences.

New Delhi’s stance also puts it in in the same bracket as United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, who have also called for implementation of the Supreme court order.

I welcome the decision by the #Maldives Supreme Court to order the release of all political prisoners and ensure their fair treatment under law.

China and Saudi Arabia, who are seen as the principal international backers of President Yameen, have yet to make any public statements.

In Geneva, Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the UN high commissioner for human rights also encouraged the Maldives government to “fully respect” the Supreme Court’s decision.

He also expressed concern at the “initial heavy-handed” reaction by the security forces against supporters celebrating the court decision. “We also urge all those celebrating, or protesting, to do so in a peaceful fashion,” said Colville."
India's Draft Telecom Policy Needs to Bridge the Gap Between Intent and Execution,https://m.thewire.in/article/tech/india-draft-telecom-policy,"May 06, 2018  |  Anubha Sinha","Earlier this week, India’s department of telecommunications (DoT) released a draft new telecom policy, titled ‘Draft National Digital Communications Policy 2018’.

The three pillars of the draft policy are ‘Connect India’, ‘Propel India’ and ‘Secure India’, which primarily seek to improve broadband connectivity, accelerate development of next-generation technologies and services and institute measures for data sovereignty, security and safety, respectively.

Several strategies have been devised under each pillar – few carry on from previous national telecom policies, and some are new proposals.

The document is high on aspirations, a lot of which it seeks to fulfil by 2022. It also proposes several favourable institutional and regulatory changes and simplifies obtaining of permissions.

However, it remains quite open-ended in terms of how the details could evolve. For example, while it endeavours to develop a fair, flexible, simple and transparent method for spectrum assignments and allocations, by pricing spectrum at an ‘optimal price’ and linking spectrum usage charges (SUC) to reflect costs of regulation and administration of spectrum, it cannot be said if these measures will fully rejuvenate a debt-ridden telecom sector.

Ideally, the policy should have explicitly mentioned that revenue maximisation is not a goal for the government anymore, to reassure the industry that licence fees and SUC will not be astronomically priced – especially as it is in no mood to change the model of spectrum allocation from auction to revenue sharing (circa NTP-99). A clear commitment would have helped inspire more confidence in this strained sector. Regardless, these changes will also need approval from the finance ministry, where stiff resistance is expected.

Expanding both wireless and wired broadband is a clear priority of the government. It sets out four initiatives, encouraging public-private partnerships to serve both rural and urban centres (BharatNet, GramNet, NagarNet, JanWiFi), and several additional measures to accelerate laying of optical fibre, mobile towers and increase sharing of infrastructure.

Although the previous telecom policies (NTP-99, NTP-2012 and recommendations in ‘Fixing Broadband Quickly’ (TRAI, 2015)) determined the similar gaps and objectives, little has translated into concrete results so far. In 2017, ITU and UNESCO reported that India was the largest unconnected market, with 49.5% (approx. 660 million) of our population still unconnected. The report further noted that the penetration of mobile broadband was much higher than fixed-line broadband connections – and urban centres were better served than rural areas. One hopes that the new strategies and objectives will be better realised this time around.

The policy also seeks to boost domestic innovation in the field of standards in communications technologies. This is reflected in its aims to strengthen domestic IP portfolios by providing financial incentives for the development of standard-essential patents (SEPs) and promote them at standard setting organisations. It mandates access to critical, mostly foreign-owned SEPs on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis (FRAND basis). This is an approach to patent licensing that has been endorsed by courts and the Competition Commission of India in the context of mobile phone technologies, as well as in other jurisdictions.

However, it remains to be seen how this mandate will be implemented in TRAI’s forthcoming recommendations on promoting telecom equipment manufacturing in India. This is a real opportunity for the telecom regulator to help the low-cost smartphone manufacturing industry in India to overcome their disadvantage in terms of having to pay exorbitant royalties to foreign-SEP holders and getting sued for infringement in the process. Another strategy that should have found place was the creation of government-controlled patent pools for SEPs, which could have solved the issue of uncertainty for local manufacturers and ensured payments to SEP holders to a great extent.

Additionally, the policy proposes a few consumer-oriented changes such as establishing a ‘Telecom Ombudsman’ and a centralised web-based complaint redressal system. In the third pillar of ‘Secure India’, although the document does not reveal the DoT’s approach to net-neutrality nor data protection and privacy, it does say that the government will be amenable to changing the terms of license to fulfill their core principles.

Curiously, in order to ‘facilitate security and safety of citizens’ it proposes to set up ‘lawful interception agencies with state of the art lawful intercept and analysis systems for implementation of law and order and national security’. This measure did not exist in TRAI’s version of the draft policy.

On next-generation tech in the field of IoT and cloud, it retained TRAI’s suggestion of setting up ‘light-touch’ licensing frameworks. This may prove to be a barrier to innovation in the field.

While the policy is broad and forward-looking, the true intent and meaning of the listed steps will only be understood when complementary legislative and granular policy actions to support these strategies are crystallised. That will make all the difference.

"Trump Administration Should Prioritise Engagement With India, Says Expert",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/trump-administration-india,"May 19, 2017  |  Yoshita Singh","New York: The Donald Trump administration must engage early and openly with Indian leaders on the situation in Pakistan as dealing with the threat from Pakistan-based terrorist groups demand its attention in the first year, a leading expert on Indian and Asian affairs has said.

Senior fellow for India with the Asia Society Policy Institute, Marshall Bouton, said in a new paper on US-India relations that the administration should also “expand intelligence sharing and seek ways to defuse tensions (between the two neighbouring countries).”

In the the paper titled The Trump Administration’s India Opportunity, he urged the administration to “engage early and openly with Indian leaders on the situation in Pakistan”.

Bouton, a nationally known expert on India and Asia, said President Donald Trump’s foreign policy statements since entering the White House on January 20 have focused on US relations with Europe and East Asia, but South Asia also presents multiple challenges for the United States.

“What to do about the war in Afghanistan? How to deal with the threat of Pakistan-based terrorist groups, both to Pakistan itself and to other countries? How to minimise the danger of renewed conflict between Pakistan and India? All of these questions will demand the administration’s attention in its first year,” he said.

Bouton, the president Emeritus of The Chicago Council on global affairs, emphasised that the larger, longer-term South Asian challenge for Washington is the decades-long rivalry between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan and “the ever-present danger that, for a fifth time in 70 years, it could spiral into war.”

Further Bouton stressed that India, which for much of the last seven decades sought to limit US involvement in its home region, is today a partner in the US effort in Afghanistan and seeks US support in dealing with the threat of provocations from an increasingly violence-ridden Pakistan.

“As the Trump administration determines how to move forward in South Asia, it would benefit from considering India’s views and taking advantage of its experience,” said Bouton, who is senior fellow at the Centre for the Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania.

He also noted that Modi will “surely press” Trump to take a much firmer stance with Pakistan on terrorism than the United States has in the past.

“In particular, Modi will argue that Pakistan continues to permit anti-India groups to operate and supports them when they attack India. He will argue that only the threat of stronger sanctions such as sharp cuts to economic and military assistance and removal of Pakistan’s designation as a major non- NATO ally might change its behaviour,” Bouton wrote in the paper.

If the US role in Afghanistan diminishes further, India will look to the United States to move more forcefully, “perhaps even requesting that Pakistan be designated as a terrorist state.”

Bouton said a “dilemma” for Washington with respect to Afghanistan is how to deal with Pakistan’s “double-dealing” throughout the war. Pakistan has provided transit and logistical support to US and NATO forces, but it has also continued to resist acting against the Haqqani network and other terror groups that have opposed the US presence in Afghanistan, cost American lives, and prolonged the war.

“In Washington, particularly in Congress, patience with Pakistan’s behaviour has grown thin,” he said.

What Did India’s Finance Ministry Think of the Objections Raised in the Rafale Deal?,https://m.thewire.in/article/government/rafale-deal-ministry-of-finance,"Apr 04, 2019  |  Yashwant Sinha","It has been established conclusively by the “stolen” documents published by The Hindu that three members of the Indian negotiating team, responsible for conducting the negotiations for the 36 Rafale fighter planes with French firm Dassault, had, in a June 2016 note submitted to the deputy chief of air staff and chairman of the Indian negotiating team, raised serious objections to some of the deal’s terms and conditions.

These objections have been widely discussed in the media and elsewhere, but a few of the serious ones need to be mentioned here again as an aide memoire.

The first objection was that the final price offered by the French government was 55.6% above the benchmark price. The final price was escalation-based while the benchmark price was firm and fixed.

The second objection was that “the reasonability of the price offered by the French government is not established. Even the final price offer by the French government cannot be considered as ’better terms’ compared to the MMRCA offer and therefore not meeting the requirement of the joint statement” issued after the meeting between the Indian prime minister and the French president.

The third objection raised by them was that the “additional commercial proposal of 1400 million Euros towards NRC for design and development ISE (India specific enhancements) was exorbitant and unrealistic”.

The fourth issue raised was with regard to sovereign or government guarantee that would have resulted in cost savings for both sides. The French side neither agreed for providing sovereign/government guarantee nor bank guarantee, nor did it even offer corresponding reduction in price because of this factor.

Also read | Why Does the CAG Have More to Say on the 2007 Rafale Process than the 2016 Deal?

The fifth point raised by these three members was with regard to the delivery schedule of the 36 planes, which was slower than the 18 planes in fly-away condition under the MMRCA process. They also observed that “the delivery schedule being offered by the French side in the IGA is highly optimistic”.

We also know that these issues were not resolved either at the level of the chairman of Indian negotiation team or at the level of the raksha mantri, and were ultimately settled by the cabinet committee on security which obviously overruled these very valid objections and decided to go ahead with the recommendations of the other four members which constituted a narrow majority of one in the seven-member negotiating team.

The finance minister’s role

What did the Ministry of Finance do, though? I am raising this question even at this late stage because I find that the role of the finance ministry, specially of the minister of finance, despite being crucial, has received little or no attention either from the media or the others.

Under the established procedure of the government of India, no cabinet note can be put up to the cabinet or any of its committees including the committee on security without the concurrence or comments of the ministry approved at the level of the finance minister himself. I also know from personal experience that all expenditure proposals are examined in great detail in the finance ministry.

The proposal to buy 36 Rafale fighter planes from the French company Dassault was not only an important proposal, but also involved a huge cost to the exchequer – nearly Rs 60,000 crore. I have no doubt in my mind that the proposal would have been examined thoroughly by the officials of the Department of Expenditure in the Ministry of Finance, especially in the light of the objections raised by the three important members of the negotiating team. Did they deal with the objections and find merit in them? Did they dismiss them as of little or no consequence? Or did they agree with the raksha mantri’s suggestion and recommend to the finance minister that the issue should be referred to the cabinet committee on security for resolution? What was the view taken by the finance minister on this issue?

The finance minister is a crucial member of the cabinet committee on security, especially when it comes to financial issues. It is a responsibility cast upon the ministry by the Transaction of Business Rules and the General Financial Rules of the government of India. The finance minister cannot shirk this responsibility, however unpleasant it may be. It is also not open to him to suggest that he is unable to settle the objections raised at the official level, which should be done by the final decision-making body, namely the cabinet committee on security.

So what view did the finance minister take? Did he support all or some of the objections raised and was overruled in the cabinet committee on security? If he failed to highlight these objections, then it should be considered a serious dereliction of duty on his part.

The Ministry of Finance generally takes a conservative view of the expenditure proposals submitted by other ministries, examines them thoroughly and often alters the proposals or rejects them totally. The officers of the Ministry of Finance are trained to do so. It is highly unlikely, therefore, that they would have ignored the very valid objections to the deal raised by the members of the negotiating team. And if they did not, then what happened at the level of the finance minister? What view did he take on these objections?

The file noting published by the Hindu newspaper also reveal that the PMO was carrying on parallel negotiations with the French side which was objected to by the officials of the Ministry of Defence. This objection was entirely valid because the prime minister and his office have no role in defence acquisition until the matter reaches the cabinet committee on security. Until then, his role is only as important as the role of the home minister or the external affairs minister, the other two members of the cabinet committee on security.

But the two ministers whose role is crucial before that stage is reached are the defence minister and the finance minister. In this deal, it is these two who have failed the country, specially the finance minister who is charged with the responsibility to ensure that government funds are spent judiciously and not wasted. The finance minister who is now the chief blogger of the government has not only ruined the economy of the country but is also guilty of serious dereliction of duty in the Rafale deal.

Untruth is not permanent, only truth is – and truth has a bad habit of turning up uninvited at the wrong time.

"Coronavirus: 324 Indians Evacuated From Wuhan, Another Flight to Leave Delhi",https://m.thewire.in/article/health/coronavirus-324-indians-evacuated-from-wuhan-another-flight-to-leave-delhi,"Feb 01, 2020  |  PTI","New Delhi: A special Air India plane landed here on Saturday morning after evacuating 324 Indian nationals from the novel coronavirus-hit Wuhan and another flight of the airline would leave the national capital for the Chinese city in the afternoon, officials said.

The first plane – Air India’s jumbo B747 aircraft carrying 211 students, 110 working professionals and three minors – reached Delhi around 7:30 am, they said.

There were five doctors from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital and one paramedical staff on board, said an Air India spokesperson.

The Indian Army has set up a quarantine facility in Manesar near Delhi to keep those evacuated from China’s Hubei province.

Officials said they would be monitored for any signs of infection for a duration of two weeks by a qualified team of doctors and staff members.

“With 324 passengers, a special flight has taken off for India from Wuhan. It may reach Delhi at 7:30 am,” said the Air India spokesperson at 1:19 am on Saturday.

The flight had departed from Delhi airport at 1:17 pm on Friday to evacuate Indian nationals from China, where more than 250 people – none of them Indian – have died due to novel coronavirus.

Hours after the arrival of the first flight from the Chinese city in Delhi, the Air India spokesperson said, “Another flight will depart to Wuhan from Delhi at 12.50 pm today with a different set of crew, same doctors’ team with other aircraft. The rescue team is again headed by Capt Amitabh Singh, Director Operation, Air India.”

Wuhan, Hubei’s capital, is the epicentre of novel coronavirus outbreak. The virus outbreak has killed 259 people in China with total confirmed cases surging to 11,791 amid stepped up efforts by a number of countries to evacuate their nationals from Hubei province, officials said on Saturday.

About Friday’s flight, the spokesperson had said earlier during the day, “A team of five doctors from RML hospital, one paramedical staff from Air India, with prescribed medicines from doctors, masks, overcoats, packed food are in the aircraft. A team of engineers, security personnel are also there in this special aircraft. Whole rescue mission is being led by Captain Amitabh Singh.”

The spokesperson had added that there were five cockpit crew members and 15 cabin crew members on Friday’s flight.

Before departure at Delhi airport, Air India chairman and managing director Ashwani Lohani had said, “No service will take place in the plane. Whatever food is there will be kept in seat pockets. As there will be no service, there will be no interaction (between cabin crew and passengers).”

“Masks have been arranged for the crew and passengers. For our crew, we have also arranged a complete protective gear,” he had added.

“Total five doctors from the Health Ministry are also going… The plane will be there (at Wuhan airport) for 2-3 hours,” Lohani had said.

Air India has done such evacuations earlier also from countries such as Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait and Nepal."
"India to Hold Disarmament, International Security Training for Foreign Diplomats",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-to-hold-disarmament-international-security-training-for-foreign-diplomats,"Jan 13, 2019  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India will be organising the first-ever intensive programme in disarmament and international security issues for foreign diplomats over the next three weeks – starting Monday, January 14.

The external affairs ministry’s foreign service institute will be hosting 27 young diplomats – all below the age of 35 – for the programme. The first edition of the annual event will be inaugurated by the United Nations under-secretary-general and high representative for disarmament affairs Izumi Nakamitsu and foreign secretary Vijay Keshav Gokhale.

According to officials, the Indian programme is the first such offering on disarmament by a member country after the UN Programme of Fellowships on Disarmament, which began over 40 years ago. “This is a demonstration of India’s commitment to nuclear issues and disarmament,” a senior MEA official said.

India considered 65 member states of Geneva based-Conference on Disarmament as the catchment area for participants in the new fellowship programme. Based on geographical representation, 30 countries were finally selected and asked to nominate their diplomats. A key criterion was that they should have prior background in disarmament issues.

Countries that have sent participants to India for the three-week programme include Vietnam, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Mongolia, Egypt and Ethiopia.

Study modules include disarmament, export controls, space security, cyberspace, maritime cooperation. The resource persons for the programmes will be coming from institutions all over the world. There will be senior officials from the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, International Atomic Energy Agency, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and export control regimes, Australia and Wassenaar groups.

According to MEA officials, the programme also includes field visits to the Narora Atomic Power Station in Uttar Pradesh, Inland Container Depot at Tughlakabad and the Indian Space Research Organisation.

Last year, India had organised a conference on UNSC Resolution 1540, which puts on the member states the onus to have domestic controls to prevent non-proliferation of nuclear and delivery materials.

“We have organised different workshops on various aspects of export control and nuclear issues like 1540 and chemical weapons convention. But this is the first time that India is organising an umbrella programme which encompasses all related issues,” the official said.

It was pointed out that India’s offer to train officials in nuclear disarmament and international security was in line with the UN secretary-general’s disarmament agenda released in 2018. One of the key aspects was investing in disarmament education, interpreted as one of the contributors for attaining Sustainable Development Goal 4, which calls for “promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence”."
An Average Indian Consumes 119% More Salt Than the WHO Limit Everyday,https://m.thewire.in/article/health/salt-consumption-india-who,"Nov 07, 2016  |  Devanik Saha, IndiaSpend.org","Excessive salt intake can lead to high blood pressure – a leading cause of cardiovascular diseases.

An average Indian consumes 10.98 grams of salt per day – 119% more than the recommended limit of five grams per day by the WHO –according to IndiaSpend analysis of a study conducted by the Australia-based George Institute of Global Health (GIGH), published in the Journal of Hypertension. Intake of excess salt can lead to high blood pressure – a leading cause of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which accounted for 23% of all deaths in India between 2010 and 2013.

The study analysed the salt intake of 227,214 Indian adults – aged 19 years and older – across 29 states and seven union territories; the reported mean salt consumption levels varied between 5.22 and 42.30 grams per day.

The primary data were obtained from various studies conducted between 1986 and 2015 (till November 2015) that reported mean or median dietary salt intake in Indians.

As many as 21 different studies were considered for the final analysis, which included 24-hour urine collection reports, 24-hour dietary recall surveys and food questionnaire surveys.

The WHO believes that high sodium consumption (more than two grams per day, equivalent to five grams salt per day) and insufficient potassium intake (less than 3.5 grams per day) contribute to high blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.

Eastern, southern states report more consumption

There was wide variance in consumption among different regions and states.

In urban areas, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Maharashtra and Gujarat reported least consumption among all states – 6-7 grams per day; in rural areas, Haryana and all the above mentioned states – except Maharashtra – reported the least consumption.

Tripura reported the maximum consumption of salt across all states – 13.14 grams per day in both rural as well as urban areas.

“Over the past 30 years, the average Indian diet has been transformed. Indians are eating less of pulses, fruits and vegetables, and a lot more of processed and fast foods,” according to Claire Johnson, lead author of the study. “Thus, their diets are now full of salt, sugars and harmful fats which are increasing the likelihood of high blood pressure, obesity and CVDs such as heart attack and stroke.”

Excess salt intake can lead to cardiovascular diseases

As many as 23% deaths in India between 2010 and 2013 were due to CVDs, according to the Causes of Death Statistics 2010-13 published by the Census office; 21.5% in rural and 29.2% in urban areas.

Heart disease continues to the highest cause of death in India, followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, IndiaSpend reported in October 2016.

The GIGH study highlighted the fact that prior studies have reported higher levels of salt intake in men than women and in urban compared with rural areas.

The Census report said that more men die due to CVDs than women in rural as well as urban areas, correlating with the observation made by the GIGH study. Men are 1.5 times more likely to suffer from a heart attack than women, IndiaSpend reported in June 2015.

Increasing consumption of processed foods is likely to be pushing up mean salt intake, particularly in urban areas, whereas widespread use of salted pickles in rural areas may account for relatively high consumption levels in rural regions, the study said.

CVDs are more expensive to treat and cause an economic burden to families. Households in India affected by cardiovascular disease spent 27% of their total household budget on out-of-pocket healthcare expenses and hospital admissions from households that had a family member with heart disease cost 4.5 times more each year than admissions from families that had no heart disease, according to an April 2014 study published in Tropical Medicine and International Health.

India needs more efforts to reduce salt consumption

Member states of the WHO, including India, have adopted a target of 30% reduction in mean population salt consumption by 2025 to prevent non-communicable diseases.

“We need a country-wide educational programme, teaching people about how to eat and how to reduce the salt in their diet,” said Vivek Jha, executive director of GIGH, India, in a statement. “It can be done but it needs investment and it needs to be made a priority, given our rapidly rising levels of CVDs and high blood pressure.”

The GIGH is designing a ‘National Salt Reduction Program for India‘ tailored to the specific social and economic circumstances of India in collaboration with the Centre for Chronic Disease Control.

The programme will develop a comprehensive policy response and action plan for the Indian government, covering stores, street vendors, chain restaurants, food manufacturers and consumers.

WHO recommendations for salt reduction

The WHO has specific recommendations for reducing salt intake and, eventually, risk of CVD and other diseases:

For adults : Adults should consume less than five grams (just under a teaspoon) of salt per day.

: Adults should consume less than five grams (just under a teaspoon) of salt per day. For children : The recommended maximum intake of salt for adults be adjusted downward for children aged two to 15 years based on their energy requirements relative to those of adults. This recommendation for children does not address the period of exclusive breastfeeding (0-6 months) or the period of complementary feeding with continued breastfeeding (6-24 months).

: The recommended maximum intake of salt for adults be adjusted downward for children aged two to 15 years based on their energy requirements relative to those of adults. This recommendation for children does not address the period of exclusive breastfeeding (0-6 months) or the period of complementary feeding with continued breastfeeding (6-24 months). All salt that is consumed should be iodised or “fortified” with iodine, which is essential for healthy brain development in the foetus and young child and optimising people’s mental function in general.

"As Communal Tweets Saga Continues Online, India Assures All Is Well With Kuwait",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/gulf-countries-muslim-tweets-kuwait,"Apr 28, 2020  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India’s relations with Gulf countries continues to be under spotlight, with the Indian Ministry of External Affairs on Monday asserting that “misuse” by “non-official” social media accounts based in Kuwait should “not be given credence,” while adding that the Kuwaiti government was committed to friendly relations with New Delhi.

India’s statement on Monday night came after a day of social media buzz over a ‘leaked’ two-month old letter of the secretary general of the Kuwaiti council of ministers.

The letter, dated March 2, which has been circulating online, is addressed to the Kuwaiti foreign minister and asks him to approach the Organisation of Islamic Conference over alleged atrocities against Indian Muslims.

The current controversy started over posts by certain Twitter handles belonging to Indian nationals based in the region, which railed against Muslims for allegedly “spreading the coronavirus.” These tweets came to the attention of eminent Arab intellectuals, largely from United Arab Emirates, over a week ago. Since the UAE has strict laws against the abuse of any other religion, most of these Twitter handles disappeared soon after.

Among those who was leading the backlash on Arab Twittersphere were Kuwaiti activist Abdur Rahman Nassar, who had posted screenshots of old tweets of an MP from India’s ruling party.

The letter, surfacing after over six weeks, adds to concerns about India’s relationship with Gulf states, but is not related to the current fracas due to the date of its creation. Instead, the letter, which officials admit is authentic, may have been written in the aftermath of the Delhi riots that took place in late February.

MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said that the government was aware of “certain references to India in non-official social media handles in Kuwait”.

“The Government of Kuwait has assured us that they are deeply committed to friendly relations with India. They also do not support any interference in the internal affairs of India,” he said in a statement.

Srivastava reminded that India had acted on request of Kuwait and deployed a Rapid Response Team to assist the Gulf state in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. “During its two week stay in Kuwait, the team rendered valuable medical assistance in testing and treatment of afflicted persons and training their personnel,” he stated.

The Indian diplomat noted that it was “therefore important that friendly and cooperative nature of our relations is accurately recognised and misuse of social media is not given credence”.

A day earlier, Kuwait’s official news agency, Kuna had issued a statement from Kuwait’s ambassador to India Jassem Al-Najem that relations between the two countries had had a historical flavour. He also stated that both countries shared many principles in foreign policy, including “non-interference in other countries’ affairs and respecting sovereignty of nations”.

Incidentally, the Twitter account of the Kuwaiti activist Nassar stands suspended at the time of publication of this article.

Earlier on April 22, the Indian embassy in Kuwait had posted on Twitter that it was important to focus on fighting COVID-19 and “not get distracted by fake news on social media with malicious intentions”.

The Indian embassy’s post had been part of a series of social media statements issued by other Indians missions in the region, calling on the Indian community last week.

The social media backlash in the Arab world had generated concern in South Block, and featured in a series of phone calls between External Affairs minister S. Jaishankar and his counterparts.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly sought to highlight that his close personal relations with Arab royal families has revitalised India’s relations with the Gulf, which is crucial for India’s energy security and largest sources of overseas remittances."
How Did India End up Staring at a Water-Uncertain Future?,https://m.thewire.in/article/environment/how-did-india-end-up-staring-at-a-water-uncertain-future,"Sep 09, 2019  |  C.P. Rajendran","The wars of the future will be fought over water. Flashpoints are already taking shape in parts of the Middle East and South Asia. The world’s water use is expected to increase by over two trillion cubic meters by 2030 – 40% more than the supply.

Water shortage seems to be the most immediate existential threat to humans. Some parts of Africa and South Asia are some of the most water-vulnerable parts of the world because of the high rate of depletion. The US National Intelligence Council views this as a serious problem that risks global food markets.

At the macro level, experts have identified the rising population, an expanding middle class and climate change as the main drivers of water shortage. But at the micro-level, it is obvious how water pollution, theft, leakages and neglect exacerbate the problem.

India’s dwindling sources of water

The United Nations’ World Urbanization Prospects indicate that India leads the pack in the projected growth of the world’s urban population between 2018 and 2050. The proportion of the urban population in India increased from 11% in 1901 to about 37.7% in 2017, adding further strain on the resource base.

As a fallout of erratic and extreme weather, the situation is expected to worsen with the rural population facing lowering productivity and income from their agricultural lands.

Over the past three decades, India has been grappling with rapid depletion of groundwater storage, driven by the erratic climate (an overall decline in rainfall) and over-extraction. Since the Green Revolution in the 1960s, groundwater has played a vital role in irrigating water-hungry crops such as rice to feed the country’s growing population. But the bounty was conditional on the overuse of fertilisers and overexploitation of groundwater.

Agriculture is proven to be the largest consumer of freshwater and for this reason alone, the aquifer level in the Gangetic plains lowered by 4 cm per year. According to Matthew Rodell, a prominent researcher from Hydrological Sciences Laboratory in NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, groundwater in northern India is being depleted at the rate of 19.2 gigatons per year.

India extracts 75 billion cubic meters of groundwater annually. This is approximately a third of the total groundwater mined globally – a stupendous amount with no parallels elsewhere in the world.

The over-exploitation of groundwater in the Indo-Gangetic plains is threatening the hydrological balance. The worst-affected regions include parts of Punjab in Pakistan and Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal in India.

It is estimated that groundwater utilisation in India has increased from 10-20 km3 to 240-260 km3 in the last 50 years. In a performance audit in 2015-16, 14 of 24 states scored below 50% on water management. These “low performers” are concentrated across the populous agricultural belts of north and east India, and the northeastern and Himalayan states.

As per NITI Aayog’s estimates, 40% of Indians will have “no access to drinking water” by 2030. The government body has also warned that several major cities run the risk of dry aquifers. The recent situation in Chennai is a clear example.

Consequences of this can be far-reaching as water shortages can hit food supplies, causing prices to soar and fuelling social unrest, according to researchers. The over-extraction is also blamed on the unregulated large-scale power subsidies to farmers who are not educated about water conservation.

Groundwater contamination

Along with the dwindling sources of water, the contamination of groundwater has also reached alarming levels in several parts of the country. India ranks 120th among 122 countries on a global water quality index.

Parts of Odisha, Bengal, Rajasthan and Gujarat are affected both by geogenic as well as anthropogenic contamination. Fluoride toxicity in Odisha – in 27 out of 30 districts – has led to acute health problems, especially among children.

Ground-based studies also indicate increased salinity and nitrate contaminants in the lower reaches of the rivers. The arsenic toxicity of the Bengal basin is another serious problem. Large-scale pumping transfers the arsenic present in the deeper levels to shallow depths and the pumped water consequently contaminates the soil and accumulates in paddy grains.

A recent study of water samples collected from wells in Rajasthan shows widespread contamination of fluoride, nitrate and uranium.

Much of the contaminants, except uranium, can be removed from the water. However, the country lacks technological remedies to treat both wastewater and potable water. Most of the megacities of India lack treatment plants for wastewater treatment. Kolkata, for example, generates about 750 million litres of wastewater and sewage daily. The core area of the city does not have a single sewage treatment plant with the sewage finally ending up in the East Kolkata Wetlands.

Grandiose solutions

Models of grandiose technological fixes as the solution to all water-related problems have gathered momentum. Politicians are now touting the concept of interlinking all major rivers (inter-basin water transfers) as a geoengineering solution to the continued water depletion.

By diverting river water, we are starving deltaic regions of freshwater that could have helped balance saltwater coming from the sea. Now, however, the deltaic ecosystem will suffer for the change.

Indus delta offers a crucial lesson here. Alice Albinia, in her 2008 book Empires of the Indus narrates how a delta system at the mouth of Indus river – which was once “the richest in all Pakistan” – became impoverished when the British started their barrage construction, which Pakistan continued post-1947.

Such examples are aplenty in India as well. The state of downstream parts of the Narmada river since the completion of the Sardar Sarovar Dam is a modern example in the making.

Need for interventions

India’s water crisis is spiralling out of control, primarily due to poor water and environmental management, inadequate or unclear laws and corruption.

A national water policy should involve a holistic approach to watershed management with a participatory role for local citizens for monitoring the hydrological cycle with the help of hydrologists, engineers and biologists.

The policy should include effective aquifer management facilitating regulation of water usage. Farmers should be taken into confidence in this exercise to help devise plans for efficient usage of water for irrigation. The government has little control over the usage of wastewater and should devise imaginative re-use programmes.

Israel, a desert country, is a success story when it comes to water resource management. Its biggest success in this regard lies in the modernisation of irrigation techniques. In Let There Be Water, Seth Siegel notes that their drip irrigation programmes save about 25-75% of pumped water. This also compels the farmers to use less water, fertilisers and pesticides. The heath of the aquifer is thus maintained at an optimum level.

Along with such interventions, we also need to incorporate elements of traditional practices in watershed management strategies. If such efforts are not put to work efficiently in a timely manner, our future will remain bleak.

India Must Not Shield Itself From International Scrutiny On Caste Discrimination,https://m.thewire.in/article/caste/india-must-not-shield-itself-from-international-scrutiny-on-caste-discrimination,"Dec 26, 2017  |  Abdullah Nasir and Priya Anuragini","The international recognition of caste-based discrimination as a form of racial discrimination may have some tangible effect on the rights of the Scheduled Castes in India.

Over 80 years after B. R. Ambedkar wrote Annihilation of Caste, caste in Indian society continues to annihilate those proclaimed to be on the wrong side of it. Birth in the so-called ‘Scheduled Castes’ is a fatal accident with almost no chance of redemption. Constitutional guarantees and legislative mandates notwithstanding, this scripturally legitimised, socially pervasive and politically relevant system of birth-based discrimination continues to haunt and hurt the Scheduled Castes of India, also called Dalits. They bear the brunt of just being born while successive governments continue to fail them, deliberately or otherwise.

In recent years, again, there has been a spate of brutal attacks on them in different parts of the country. For instance, in Una, Gujarat, cow vigilantes attacked a group of Dalit men for merely performing what caste society regards as their caste-prescribed duty; elsewhere, the Yogi Adityanath government of Uttar Pradesh booked Chandrasekhar Ravan, a Dalit leader, under the National Security Act – a draconian preventive detention law – when the Allahabad high court had already pronounced the charges against him to be politically motivated.

In a report on minority issues submitted last year, the United Nations Human Rights Council’s (UNHRC) special rapporteur noted that there had ben a significant increase in crimes against Dalits. Worryingly, the report also pointed to state complicity in institutionalising the practice of manual scavenging, which continues to kill Dalit sanitation workers and is rampant in India despite laws to the contrary. Clearly, the Indian state has failed to ensure the demise of caste-based discrimination. This provides a compelling reason to evaluate if recognition of caste-based discriminations as racial discrimination by India – and the consequent international scrutiny this will attract – may have some tangible effect.

International law and caste discrimination

The International Convention on Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination is a major international instrument that aims to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations from the world. India is a party to the convention and as per Article 9 is mandated to submit a report, every two years, stating the measures taken in furtherance of the objectives of the convention. This report needs to be submitted to a committee, referred to as the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), established under Article 8 of the convention.

The convention defines racial discrimination to mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life. Importantly, the word ‘caste’ is not expressly mentioned in this definition; however the CERD, in its 61st session in 2002, recommended that:

“Discrimination based on descent includes discrimination against members of communities based on forms of social stratification such as caste and analogous systems of inherited status which nullify or impair their equal enjoyment of human rights.”

Despite this, India has consistently reiterated that ‘caste’ cannot be equated with ‘race’ or covered under ‘descent’ and thus has refused any information pertaining to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes or issues related to this group in the periodic reports it submits to the CERD.

Also read: The Ugly Reality of Caste Violence and Discrimination in Urban India

India justifies its stand by taking recourse to its constitutional provisions in which the terms caste, race and descent are used separately and thus are mutually exclusive. The fact is, however, that these terms were used separately out of abundant caution so as to completely eliminate the possibility of discrimination in a country beset with different kinds of inequality and oppression and thus it is difficult to conclude that the terms are completely distinct and that there is no overlap. Further, the Constituent Assembly debates do not provide much clarity as to the exact scope of these terms. In fact, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was being drafted, India actually advocated that caste should be recognised as a prohibited ground of discrimination at the international level, albeit this did not fructify. The issue was raised briefly by its delegates, Mohamed Habib and A. Appadorai, before finally being dropped because, as Appadorai put it, “his delegation had only proposed the word “caste” because it objected to the word “birth”. The words “other status” and “social origin” were sufficiently broad to cover the whole field” of discrimination.

Interestingly, even the term descent, initially, was not included in the draft definition of racial discrimination under the convention and was put in only because of an amendment proposed by India. This clearly illustrates the fact India’s stance on recognition of caste as a prohibited ground of discrimination at the international level has changed over the years to shield itself from international scrutiny. Considering that even India’s erstwhile ‘Hindu’ neighbour Nepal has no qualms in recognising caste-based discriminations within the ambit of the racial discrimination convention, it’s difficult to rationalise India’s position.

How bringing caste in would help India’s Dalits

What’s worth mentioning here is that the CERD has already made a number of recommendations on issues that continue to plague the Scheduled Castes of India and if implemented, in earnest, may prove instrumental in improving their condition.

First, one of the notable recommendations of the committee was that the affirmative action benefits must be given to all Dalits irrespective of their religion. India, till date, takes away caste-based entitlements from Dalits who decide to embrace Islam or Christianity based on a 1950 Presidential Order. The order provides that only Hindus (including Sikhs and Buddhists) can be Scheduled Caste. This has been vehemently criticised even by the government-appointed Gopal Singh committee in 1983. The Supreme Court of India, in the case of Soosai v. Union of India, has also conceded that caste continues to exist even after conversion. Despite this, the 1950 order continues to be in force. But recognition of caste-based discrimination as racial may impel the Indian government to stop this religion-based discrimination against a section of the Scheduled Castes.

Second, the CERD has recommended that reservation benefits to Dalits must be extended to the private sector. While this idea has been mooted in India, it has hardly received any serious consideration from the government. The CERD also urged India to provide protection to Dalits against arbitrary arrest, ensure effective remedies and justice to those who are victims of caste-linked violence and strengthen efforts to eradicate entrenched social acceptance of caste based discrimination. However, since India continues to regard caste-based discrimination as outside the purview of the CERD, these recommendations, relevant as they are, remain on paper – not even meriting attention from the government.

Recognition of caste-based discrimination as racial may not be the magic wand that would set right centuries-old wrongs or even immediately transform the ground realities in India. But international discussion and concomitant international pressure will surely have a positive effect on the discourse concerning the rights of Scheduled Castes in India, particularly in this globalised world.

Also, India has been vociferously asserting itself as a superpower at the international level and has a reputation to protect and thus may not be able to brush the CERD’s recommendations completely under the carpet once it recognises caste-based discriminations to be within its purview. India’s periodic reports to the CERD have been pending since 2008. And in the current scenario of accentuated discrimination against Dalits, not only should they be submitted at the earliest, but they should also provide all the necessary information pertaining to Dalits to the international body. In fact, India should go a step further and make a declaration under Article 14 of the convention and allow individual aggrieved Dalits to directly approach the CERD. India takes pride in being the world’s largest democracy; it’s time it acted accordingly.

Indian Banks Back in UK Court Over Mallya's Non-Payment of Debt,https://m.thewire.in/article/business/indian-banks-back-in-uk-court-over-mallyas-non-payment-of-debt,"Dec 11, 2019  |  Aditi Khanna","London: A consortium of Indian public sector banks led by State Bank of India (SBI) is back in the UK high court to seek a bankruptcy order against liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya over the alleged unpaid debt of around 1.145 billion pounds.

Judge Michael Briggs is presiding over a hearing in the insolvency division of the court in London this week in relation to a bankruptcy petition filed by the banks back in 2018 in their attempt to recoup unpaid debt accrued by the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.

A previous UK High Court ruling had refused to overturn a worldwide order freezing Mallya’s assets and upheld an Indian court’s ruling that the consortium of 13 Indian banks was entitled to recover funds amounting to nearly 1.145 billion pounds.

The banks then launched efforts to recover dues as part of the freezing order, with the bankruptcy petition aimed at seizing UK-based Mallya’s assets to recover the dues.

Besides SBI, the 13 Indian banks include Bank of Baroda, Corporation Bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd.

They have secured follow-on High Court orders to recover some of the funds owed to them as a result of Kingfisher Airlines’ unpaid loans.

In July, the banks had won a High Court battle to access documents they were after to establish the true ownership of assets they believed were linked with the embattled liquor tycoon.

“Frankly, the answer needs to be known as to which assets are that of Mr. Mallya, both for the purpose of the worldwide freezing order and enforcement of the judgment,” Justice Robin Knowles had ruled.

Two superyachts, a game reserve in South Africa, numerous undeclared high-value and vintage cars, valuable paintings and a piano previously owned by famous British singer-songwriter Elton John were among some of the assets on their target list.

The true ownership of a plush home overlooking Regent’s Park in the heart of London also remains in contention.

Mallya’s legal team has argued that the petition for bankruptcy in the UK should be dismissed because the banks are pursuing the same debt through the Indian courts.

The lawyers have also sought a stay on proceedings until Mallya’s appeal against his extradition order, scheduled in the Royal Courts of Justice in London, is heard in February next year.

Meanwhile, Mallya remains on bail pending the appeal hearing in the extradition proceedings brought by India in relation to charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to an alleged Rs 9,000 crores.

He had been arrested on an extradition warrant back in April 2017 and has been fighting his extradition in the UK courts since then.

India Goes All Out to Lobby Support for Dalveer Bhandari's Re-Election to ICJ,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/dalveer-bhandari-reelction-international-court-of-justice,"Aug 17, 2017  |  Devirupa Mitra","With the ICJ to adjudicate on the Kulbhushan Jadhav case over the next few years, having an Indian judge on the bench is a national priority.

New Delhi: It is all-hands-on-deck, as the Indian government makes an all-out effort to get Dalveer Bhandari re-elected to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), as a last minute nomination and a complicated electoral procedure keeps New Delhi on tenterhooks about his prospects.

India officially began the process of re-nominating Bhandari in late June, which kick-started the lobbying process to get him on back on the bench in The Hague’s Peace Palace.

With the ICJ to adjudicate the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav over the next few years, the perception in New Delhi is that having an Indian judge on the bench is a national priority. Pakistan, the other party in the “Jadhav Case”, also has the right to nominate an ad-hoc judge to the bench since the ICJ has a serving Indian judge, but not one with Pakistani nationality.

The Wire has learnt that the lobbying has already begun at the highest level. During the G-20 meeting in Hamburg in the first week of July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi solicited support for Bhandari in all his diplomatic interactions with foreign leaders.

His next important foreign visits are to the BRICS summit in Xiamen, China, and then a bilateral trip to Myanmar, where he is likely to raise the issue again.

Modi is apparently skipping the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session in September for the second consecutive year. External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj will be leading the Indian delegation at the UNGA’s high-level segment from September 19-25. Swaraj’s top priority, it is understood, will be to directly speak to her peers at the gathering in New York and get as many committed votes for Bhandari as possible.

There is a “very high level” of effort being put in by the Indian government to return Bhandari to the ICJ. Instructions have gone out to ensure that Bhandari’s candidature finds mentions at India’s diplomatic interactions, whether they involve just diplomats or the country’s top leaders.

However, rather than in New York, India’s campaign will be more effective when there is a direct outreach to the capitals.

Accordingly, plans are being drawn up to draft personal letters from the prime minister to his counterparts. There are also proposals to send special envoys to the critical countries to garner support.

All this extra effort is being made as the Indian government considers having an Indian judge in the ICJ as a political priority. This perception of the ICJ’s importance is mainly centred over the judicial body arbitrating India’s case against Pakistan.

After a Pakistani military court sentenced Jadhav to death on terror charges in April, India dragged Pakistan to the ICJ for violating the international law by denying consular access to Jadhav. Accepting India’s plea for provisional measures, the ICJ effectively stayed Jadhav’s execution until a final judgement order is passed.

India has to submit its written pleadings by September 13, while Pakistan will get another three months to file a rebuttal. That will not be the end of the process as the court will decide if more rounds of written submissions or oral hearings are required. The proceedings could stretch to two to three years – the average time for most contentious cases in the ICJ.

Bhandari’s term officially ends only in February 2018. Therefore, Pakistan is already pushing ahead with plans to seek the appointment of an ad-hoc judge of its choice under Article 31 of the ICJ statute.

The Pakistani newspaper Express Tribune reported on August 15 that the attorney general of Pakistan has recommended three names to the prime minister’s office for the post of an ad-hoc judge, including a former chief justice and a senior lawyer who is an expert in international arbitration. The third name is that of former Jordan Prime Minister Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, whose resignation mid-way through his term as a judge in the ICJ in 2009 led to the vacancy that was filled by Bhandari.

The coming together of the entire diplomatic machinery behind Bhandari is especially remarkable, as even till the early months of 2017, the South Block was more inclined to demit the Indian seat in the current election cycle. It was only after India approached the ICJ against Pakistan that the government started leaning towards retaining Bhandari. Even so, a decision to go ahead was only taken after India’s candidate for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea won handsomely.

Under Article 9 of the ICJ statute, the 15 seats are to be represented by the “main forms of civilisation and of the principal legal systems of the world”. In the absence of any consensus of how to define them, the 15 seats became allotted by default as per the geographical categories of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).

All the countries whose judges’ terms were ending, had already decided to re-nominate them much earlier. These are Ronny Abraham (France), Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade (Brazilian), Christopher Greenwood (UK), Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somalia).

However, India decided on Bhandari’s re-nomination only a few weeks before the July 3 deadline. This despite that India’s seat for Asia Pacific group already had a contender in the form of Lebanon’s permanent representative, Nawaf Salam. The only other non-sitting candidate in the fray is from Zambia.

There is a growing perception that, perhaps, India took the wrong call in following the unwritten norm of not announcing the candidacy of the nomination of a sitting ICJ judge well in advance. While the other sitting judges also did not announce their nominations officially, there was enough gossip about their candidacy for months, and even years, ahead.

Lebanon had announced the nomination of Salam, a consummate UN insider, two years ago. Salam has been Lebanon’s envoy to the UN for ten years, including two years in the UNSC in 2010 and 2011.

The reason for the uneasiness in the delay in Bhandari’s nomination may be due to the unique electoral process for the ICJ.

Both the 193-member UNGA and the 15-member UNSC have to vote independently to elect the members of the ICJ. A candidate who obtains a simple majority in both the UN bodies is deemed as elected. There can be several rounds of voting to get a common candidate to fill in all the five vacant seats. In the 2014 ICJ elections, voting took place over several days to fill in the fifth seat, before one candidate withdrew.

New Delhi’s main concern is the UNSC. According to officials, the ten non-permanent members are also “very serious” campaigners of the UN elections and have naturally lined up support three to four years ago.

Therefore, India’s last-minute campaign puts Bhandari at a disadvantage, as most of the countries have already committed their support.

The traditional way to lure support is with quid-pro-quo arrangement in other elections in various world bodies. That’s why, Egypt, currently a non-permanent UNSC member announced that it will support Bhandari. In return, India has agreed to back the Egyptian candidate for the post of director general of UNESCO.

Most of the European and Latin Americans nations usually don’t reveal their hand till just before the election, according to UN observers. There is also no clear sign of backing from the permanent members, with only France revealing its hand as it has nominated Lebanon’s Nawaf Salam. Bhandari’s nomination is officially backed by India, along with Australia, Bangladesh, Colombia and Israel.

The ballot paper for the ICJ election is different from other UN elections. For example, for election in the UNSC, if a country is listed for a seat which is allotted to another geographical area, that vote is disqualified. But in the ICJ election, there are no such restrictions to disqualify votes.

While India seems to be doing “okay”, the numbers are still not enough for Bhandari’s win. This is despite the fact that Bhandari has advantages over the senior Lebanese diplomat as he has served as a sitting member of the ICJ and was also a former Supreme court judge."
India's Weak Economic Data Turns FPIs From Net Buyers to Net Sellers in December,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/indias-weak-economic-data-turns-fpis-from-net-buyers-to-net-sellers-in-december,"Dec 08, 2019  |  PTI","Reversing their buying trend, foreign portfolio investors (FPI) turned net sellers in December with a net outflow of Rs 244 crore from the capital markets amid subdued economic data.

According to the depositories data, foreign investors pulled out a net sum of Rs 1,668.8 crore from equities. FPIs, however, invested Rs 1,424.6 crore on a net basis in the debt segment, resulting in a total net outflow of Rs 244.2 crore in December so far.

FPIs had been net buyers for two months to November. They invested Rs 16,037.6 crore in October and Rs 22,871.8 crore in November on a net basis.

“FPIs adopted a cautious approach while investing in Indian equities, on the back of subdued economic indicators. It has not been a good year for the Indian economy so far and the recently released GDP number which continued the southward march for the seventh quarter in a row falling to 4.5% reaffirmed the slowdown in the Indian economy,” said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

FPIs would continue to be watchful of the domestic environment and tread cautiously, he added.

Echoing the views, Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO Groww said, “Trump threatening to continue the US-China trade war well past 2020 is definitely making global investors cautious. The repo rate was not reduced, unlike the FPIs’ expectations. Plus the latest GDP numbers are also responsible for bearish behaviour of FPIs."

How Indian Muslims Engaged in COVID-19 Relief Efforts Are Countering Hate With Love,https://m.thewire.in/article/society/covid-19-relief-effort-muslims,"Apr 27, 2020  |  Musaddique Thange","“By its very nature, hate destroys and tears down; by its very nature, love creates and builds up.”

– Martin Luther King Jr.

As India soldiers through its lockdown amid the COVID-19 crisis, it is clear that the devastation it has wrought on lives and livelihoods is unprecedented in living memory.

From living on the fringes of society to now struggling for survival, the lived reality of millions of Indians today is one of deprivation and desperation. Dominating the narrative is also a vile and hateful worldview that seeks to find opportunity in a humanitarian catastrophe, and reflects a willingness to advance a “nationalist” agenda, albeit at the cost of the nation.

Thankfully, the story of COVID-19 in India does not begin with deprivation and end in hate. An integral aspect of our collective situation today is that tragedy has engendered resolve, and for some noble souls, countering hate is an exercise in demonstrating love and compassion.

Initiatives across the country to provide relief to the most vulnerable segment of society reflect how civil society can make a difference even in the face of government inefficacy and ineptitude. Especially heartening is the work of organisations that are working to provide succour to all, regardless of religious or caste identities.

In Mumbai, “Food – Ek Chhoti Si Asha” is a broad community relief effort initiated by Nikhat Mohamedy, a Hijab-clad Muslim lady.

Now serving over 25,000 meals a day to the poor and destitute across the metropolitan city and far-flung suburbs, it all started with Mohamedy coming across a daily wage worker from the slums who had not eaten for two days. This led to her cooking food for 150 people in the vicinity of her home near Crawford Market.

The sheer extent of the need and Mohamedy’s passion for relieving hunger saw many more people join and contribute to the effort with their time and money. Today, the organisation has one main kitchen serving 15,000 meals a day and several “satellite kitchens” across the city serving an additional 10,000 to 15,000 people.



Volunteers, donors and beneficiaries come from every religious community and every sect. “This is about recognising the fact that we are all children of Adam and Eve, and feeding those brothers and sisters who are hungry and deprived is fundamental to expressing our humanity, ” says Mohamedy.

“For me, personally, this work is also an expression of my identity as a Muslim. Widespread prejudice against Muslims cannot be allowed to get in the way of serving all who are impacted by this crisis regardless of their religious identify or social status,” she adds.

Helping Hand Foundation, a nationwide NGO operating in the health sector is another organisation that has pivoted towards awareness campaigns and emergency assistance in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.

A dedicated team of 100 volunteers including several ambulance drivers, nurses, paramedics, counsellors and patient care givers are working on a daily basis to reach out to areas where food and medical attention are urgently needed. This is in addition to awareness campaigns on social distancing and hygiene, in government hospitals as well as in slums, along with the efforts it takes in educating the masses on ways to safeguard their health at this time.

“We have been engaged in the mission to serve our fellow citizens even before COVID-19. The magnitude of the challenge facing our country and the sheer plight of those in need has only strengthened our resolve to do more,” says Mujtaba Askari, the organisation’s founder and trustee who is based in Hyderabad.

“As for the demonisation of Muslims, the antidote to hate can never be hate. It is love and compassion,” Askari adds.

The phenomenon of individuals and organisations transcending religious differences to serve all is not limited to Muslims.

In Mumbai, a Bengali Welfare Association has reallocated the funds meant for Durga Puja celebrations towards COVID-19 relief efforts. From Gurdwaras to Buddhist monasteries hundreds of houses of worship of practically every religious community have recognised the existential nature of the crisis facing the country and the world, and have risen to the occasion by welcoming everyone who needs help.

The point of highlighting Muslims doing the same is not to take anything away from the magnanimity of these laudable efforts. In the current climate, however, of unending vitriol being poured on Muslims by some public figures and media outlets, there is something especially uplifting about so many Indian Muslims rising above anger and bitterness to stay focused on providing relief to fellow citizens.

Not only are Muslim-led efforts in various states working towards relief a common phenomenon, established nationwide organisations of Indian Muslims such as the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) have a long track record of being in the forefront of relief efforts in the face of natural calamities. Their grassroots-based nationwide network is now being effectively leveraged to provide relief to Indians of every creed and caste, which the organisation plans to continue until the lockdown is in place.

Undoubtedly, the struggle to save India’s soul will be long and hard, and things will likely get worse before they get better.

However, it is the acts of kindness that so many people of every religious community are willing to extend to each other that keeps the hope alive for millions of Indians.

These acts already represent a triumph of pluralism over bigotry, and of compassion over cruelty.

Does the Economy Really Matter When it Comes to Winning Elections in India?,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/economy-really-matter-comes-winning-elections-india,"Nov 10, 2017  |  Pranab Mukhopadhyay and Aparna Lolayekar","In the 13 of the 20 states that voted for change since 2014, all have had a declining or zero rate of growth in per capita incomes for the five-year period prior to the election year.

Ease of business, Goods and Services Tax (GST), repo rates and demonetisation are all in the news, and so are the impending elections. A few months ago, the Reserve Bank of India confirmed that 99% of the demonetised notes (Rs 1000 and Rs 500) are back in its vaults. This is an indication that the demonetisation effort was “successful”.

Unfortunately, economic growth in the last quarter dropped by 2.2% over the same period last year.

Critics of demonetisation say that the falling growth is a vindication of their claim, while supporters of demonetisation feel that the slowdown is a larger continuing phenomenon. It would be hard to believe that lack of liquidity did not create a transmission shock, affecting the real economy, but it may also be a stretch to attribute the entire decline to demonetisation. Independent of this, the fall in growth rates alone could turn out to be bad news for the ruling dispensation if we were to anticipate that economic growth does impact election outcomes.

While pollsters are already predicting the future from their surveys, it is worth checking if economic outcomes and poll outcomes have been correlated in the recent past in India.

It is popularly believed that an incumbent party’s past performance is the principal factor determining individuals’ voting decision. Does this hold true for India where voting behaviour is influenced by social identities like ethnicity, family lineages, religion and caste? Since this is common knowledge to all contestants and voters, political competition should typically reduce ethnic rents of this nature to zero, presumably leaving one thing to distinguish between incumbents and their competitors – past performance or promise of better governance. Since past performance is often a good indicator, expectations are history dependent.

One of the quantifiable yard sticks to judge past performance of an incumbent party is growth in incomes experienced during the period of their governance. In a study of poll outcomes covering 422 candidates in India’s 2009 parliamentary elections, Gupta and Panagariya (2014) found that candidates of incumbent parties in high-growth states have much better prospects of victory than those in low-growth states.

This expectation has been re-affirmed in election outcomes since 2014. States that had positive growth re-elected the incumbent party and states that had declining growth rejected the incumbent party (see table). Twenty states cumulatively went to polls since 2014 (Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Odisha and Sikkim), 2015 (Delhi and Bihar), 2016 (Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal) and 2017 (Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand).

In 2014, the Indian economy had seen a decline in income growth rate and we saw the incumbent Congress get a drubbing in the parliamentary elections. In the 13 of the 20 states that voted for a change since 2014, all (except Haryana) had a declining rate of growth in per capita incomes for the five-year period prior to the election year. Haryana had a neither an increase nor a decline.

In the six states where the incumbents were re-elected, three had an increasing growth (Manipur, Sikkim, West Bengal) and three had a declining growth (Arunachal, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu). This outcome in the first three states is in line with our claim but the latter group seems to contradict our claim – or there may be something different going on in these states that may have over-ridden the economic growth factor.

For example, Arunachal Pradesh has elected the Congress as the single largest party since 1984. Similarly, Odisha has elected the Biju Janata Dal as the single largest party since 2000. It is possible, therefore, that persistence or inertia (for lack of a better term) may be an explanator for Arunachal and Odisha where despite a declining growth rate, the electorate may have elected the incumbent.

Tamil Nadu, however, has not exhibited such long unbroken romance with AIADMK and in that sense, is an outlier. Goa and Manipur elected the Congress as the single largest party in the 2017 elections, but the Bharatiya Janata Party formed an alliance post-election that gave them a majority in the legislature. Bihar was an odd case. Prior to the elections, there was a split between the incumbent allies Janata Dal (United) and the BJP. The JD(U), Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress, for the first time, formed an alliance against the BJP. So it is open to interpretation whether the election of the alliance was one of re-electing the incumbent government or a change.

The election results may be reiterating a message that our political parties have long internalised – “roti, kapda our makan” or “sabka saath, sabka vikas”. What does this foretell for the seven states that are gearing up to go to polls over the next year – namely Gujarat, Nagaland, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Tripura and Mizoram and the ones that follow in 2019, including the parliamentary elections? Is the writing already on the wall or will there be any surprises? We will know soon.

India Resists Lobbying by US Payment Firms to Ease Local Data Storage Rules,https://m.thewire.in/article/business/india-resists-lobbying-by-us-payment-firms-to-ease-local-data-storage-rules,"May 30, 2018  |  Aditi Shah, Aditya Kalra and Sumeet Chatterjee","New Delhi/Hong Kong: India’s central bank is standing firm on a directive to compel global payment firms to store customer data in India, resisting calls from US companies to dilute an order they say would cost them millions of dollars, people familiar with the matter said.

The payment companies are worried India’s data onshoring move could set a precedent and nudge other major governments to implement similar rules at a time when there is heightened scrutiny on how companies globally handle their customers’ data.

The industry’s tussle with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also comes as Prime Minster Narendra Modi aggressively pushes digital and cashless modes of payment that leave an electronic trail as part of a campaign to crack down on the black economy.

While Modi’s administration is working on a separate data protection law, foreign companies were caught off guard in April by the RBI’s one-page directive that said all payments data should within six months be stored only in the country for “unfettered supervisory access”.

The RBI said storing data locally would help “ensure better monitoring”.

A joint lobbying effort by American Express Co, Mastercard Inc and Visa Inc to dilute or reverse the directive has failed to shift the central bank’s position, with the RBI telling the firms in a meeting this month to comply, not complain, sources with direct knowledge told Reuters.

The RBI declined to comment, but a government source with direct knowledge confirmed the central bank was “unlikely to back down on its plans”.

Investment plans

The card companies are nervous that the move will disrupt their investment plans, as millions of dollars are diverted from other projects in a scramble to open local data centres within six months.

“There is a feeling of helplessness and we will have to comply,” said a source with direct knowledge of the meetings.

The RBI’s insistence that payments data be stored “only in India” would hamper global fraud detection and the companies should be allowed to keep a back-up, the sources said.

The government source disagreed.

“The suggestion that you need a disaster management back-up centre overseas just does not cut it,” said the source, who declined to be identified. “This is not a small island nation that would get entirely crippled by a single natural disaster.”

Mastercard said it was working with the industry to engage the RBI “to understand their need for access to domestic data and work towards a solution that meets the regulatory requirements” in line with global norms.

Visa declined to comment, while American Express did not respond to a request for comment.

The move would not impact local players such as Softbank Group-backed Indian digital payments firm Paytm, as well as homegrown card payment network RuPay, which competes with the likes of Visa and Mastercard, as they already store their data in India.

‘Only in India’

The industry says India’s proposed data storage rules would be among the world’s most restrictive.

China also tightened cyber regulation in the past year, formalising new rules that require firms to store data locally. None of the global payment card companies, however, operate in the Chinese domestic market yet.

Countries such as Russia and Indonesia also have an onshore data storage requirement, but they do not restrict companies from transfer of transactions data offshore as well, according to lobby group US-India Business Council (USIBC), which counts the three US card companies among its members.

Global payment firms currently store and process Indian transactions outside the country and a major concern to the industry is a clause in the RBI’s order that asks for data to be stored “only in India”, two sources said.

That, according to the industry, would restrict the transfer of data needed to effectively detect and analyse global fraud patterns, and make India more vulnerable to financial crime.

In a letter dated May 3, seen by Reuters, the USIBC pressed the RBI for a “reversal or an indefinite stay” of its directive, which it said would make India’s payments ecosystem more prone to cyber-attacks.

It also urged the RBI to remove any restriction on transferring the data outside India and specify the time period for which the data needed to be stored locally.

An industry executive at a US payments firm said while the RBI was likely to soon issue clarifications to address some of their concerns, but it would not change the notification’s implementation date.

In an earnings call last month, Visa CEO Alfred Kelly Jr. referred to the RBI’s six-month deadline as a “tough timeframe”.

The directive comes as more people in India are switching to plastic money, partly driven by the Modi’s decision to replace high-value currency notes in November 2016, since when the government has aggressively discouraged cash transactions.

In March, Indians clocked transactions worth $52 billion using their 900 million credit and debit cards, nearly double the amount recorded in November 2016, data from the RBI showed.

But fraud is a concern too. The RBI recorded 57,411 cases of card fraud totalling $43 million in the three years to December 2017, according to an RTI response seen by Reuters.

The RBI in April said the payment ecosystem in India had “expanded considerably”, making it necessary to ensure “the safety and security” of data.

Will COVID-19 Intensify the Fault Lines of India's Already Unequal Society?,https://m.thewire.in/article/health/india-inequality-covid-19,"Apr 27, 2020  |  Sandeep Kumar","Like most healthcare workers, my profession puts me at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. Statistically, however, my risk of acquiring a serious infection is reasonably modest and the probability of dying from it quite low. After all, I practice medicine at a premier hospital in the wealthiest nation on this planet and have access to cutting-edge medical care, was I to develop this infection. It also gives me some comfort to realise that my family has the cushions to ward off any financial hardships, if I succumb to this ailment.

I recently came across the news of a man in West Bengal, who allegedly died at the hands of the police when he went to procure milk for his children during the lockdown. He perished, I imagine, uncelebrated for this seemingly selfless act. Being a father myself, I wonder what happened to his children. Countless such tragedies are likely unfolding across the globe, hidden in the available statistics. While it appears that the virus is socially blind, affecting the rich and the poor alike, the reality is that the burden of the pandemic and measures to mitigate its effects have fallen heavily on the world’s poor.

Although much has been written about differences in individual susceptibility to this infection – age, coexisting health conditions – relatively little attention has been focused on the economic and societal attributes of a population, which carry major implications on the risk of contracting the infection and or dying during the pandemic.

Emerging data indicates that the disease is disproportionately affecting the disadvantaged and the marginalised. In the US, the working class, Black, Hispanic and immigrant communities have been hit the hardest. Similar patterns have been observed in China and Europe. And there are concerns that the situation will be even more dire in India with its gnawing economic and societal disparities.

Estimates from United Nations reveal that over a billion people worldwide live in the slums, a third of them in India. Almost half of them cohabit with five or more people in a room. It is easy to see how a virulent contagion like COVID-19 will spread in this milieu. The bigger question, really, is what will be the scale of this calamity for India as a whole and for its different sections of society? Familiar faces of people come to my mind when I think of these questions. I think about Renu, who cooks for my 90-year old father back in Delhi, Kasturi, who cleans his apartment, the 14-year old who delivers milk packets in the morning. I worry, “What if?”

Have the Indian policymakers given serious thought to millions of Renus and Kasturis of India? Ignoring their lived realities and the deep social divisions of India can jeopardise plans and execution for an effective, coordinated response to an outbreak on this scale. Contagion, especially from a virulent respiratory infection, will likely spread easily in these settlements and can seed the rest of the city and beyond.

In my quest for some answers I came across the works of Drs Achla and Madhav Marathe (a husband and wife team) and their colleagues at Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing Division at the Biocomplexity Institute at the University of Virginia. Over the past 20 years, they have done stellar work modelling the scale and trajectory of epidemics, including H5N1, H1N1, MERS, Ebola, Zika as well as more recently on the spread of influenza in slums of Delhi.

So, I reached out to Dr Achla Marathe for a phone chat. I peppered her with questions, trying to understand their methodology and gauge the robustness of their projections. She emphasises that ignoring the attributes of people dwelling in these overcrowded communities and the dynamics of spread of the infection within it significantly underestimates the rapidity and extent of spread of the contagion in the entire population.

I ask, do the current models include “accelerators” of pandemic spread like urban slums? What about the projections for spread in rural India especially in light of the mass migration of workers? It turns out that a major void in available information and data makes reasonable predictions difficult. In other modelling efforts, the plight of the marginalised and their specific attributes have not been taken into consideration. I am unsure if this stems from methodological constraints, paucity of resources to gather essential data elements or a lack of intellectual curiosity.

Regrettably, the world is playing catch-up to pandemic. In India, the virus was making inroads while its leaders and its administrative machinery were caught up serenading the visiting US president. Physical distancing seems to be the only viable option at this stage in the absence of an effective vaccine or pharmaceutical prophylaxis. Others have rightly pointed out that the concept of social distancing is an anomaly for large sections of the Indian population. And while people of means are able to practice physical distancing, paradoxically large sections of the society are now being hemmed in together.

I bring this up in my conversation with Dr Marathe and ask her how her previous work can inform a more rational response in these circumstances. She agrees that close confinement of large section of the population can be counterproductive and believes that immediate identification, contact tracing and prompt relocation of infected individuals from these settlements make more intuitive sense.

A nationwide lockdown will be a very bitter pill to swallow for many. It is being claimed that the current lockdown will decrease the infection rate by 70 to 80%. It needs to be emphasised that these numbers refer to decreasing risk of COVID-19 infections only. What will be its effect on mortality during these times including death from starvation? How will those with other chronic ailments and non-COVID-19 illness fare during the lockdown? In a food scarce nation, will it disproportionately affect children, especially of the poor? In other words, the net effects of an abrupt countrywide lockdown remain unchartered at this time.

Quarantine and lockdowns are necessary firefighting measures during extreme times. Conversely, it may have catastrophic effects for India’s poor majority. The COVID-19 pandemic and the response to it threaten to exacerbate entrenched economic and social disparities.

Keeping India’s downtrodden central, therefore, should be an integral part of a coherent response to the pandemic. Policymakers must devise interventions keeping in mind two important considerations: the susceptibility to infection spread and pre-existing societal and economic vulnerabilities.

While we all hope that immediate threat from this outbreak slows down and the lockdowns are lifted soon, it appears that the risk of this pandemic is likely to linger on. Current projections indicate that it may show multiple peaks like the influenza pandemic of 1918-20, which killed an estimated 12-17 million people in India, the most in the world.

It is likely that COVID-19 will largely be an affliction of lower classes. Or will it be? An insightful study of the 1918 influenza pandemic by Svenn-Erik Mamelund at the Metropolitan University in Oslo points otherwise. The virus of 1918, after all, did not spare the higher-class natives of Europe and North America. While the first wave largely affected the poor and the marginalised, the second wave that followed soon, in historical irony, disproportionately affected the more affluent.

We risk making the same mistakes by ignoring the lessons of the past. I hope this cautionary tale from history will awaken a more compassionate view of the crisis.

Autonomous Agency Under PMO Mooted to Harness Potential of Indian Geospatial Industry,https://m.thewire.in/article/science/indian-geospatial-industry,"Dec 07, 2019  |  Anusuya Datta","A high-level think tank led by former Nasscom head Dr B.V.R. Mohan Reddy and former ISRO Chairman A.S. Kiran Kumar has called for the formation of an independent, non-partisan autonomous agency under the Prime Minister’s Office or the Niti Aayog for shaping India’s geospatial roadmap. It has also called for an integrated national geospatial strategy to harness the potential of the industry and leverage its power in the national development agenda.

Dr Reddy, who is the chair of the think tank which has experts from different walks of life including public sector data generating agencies, central and state government users, private geospatial companies and civil society organizations, formally released a vision document called Geospatial Strategy for New India, in Hyderabad on December 3. The document, released during GeoSmart India, the country’s premier geospatial conference, proposes that the agency includes members from across ministries/departments involved in geospatial data generation; important user industries; private sector and civil society representatives.

While listing out the role and importance of geospatial technologies in India’s growth and development, the document called for the autonomous geospatial agency to act as the vanguard of all public sector data in India. Additionally, it should also actively work with various departments and other public sector organizations that are looking at policies pertaining to geospatial planning, environment, drones, construction innovations, or simply the use of geospatial for more efficient decision-making, the think tank feels.

The document also calls for a countrywide network of 4,000 CORS stations (Continuously Operating Reference Stations) in India. While Survey of India has already started some work in this direction, it had hit some funding issues as the mapping agency is yet to get the INR 125 crore initially sanctionced for this work. Incidentally, Surveyor General of India, Lt Gen Girish Kumar, announced at the conference that SOI will complete setting up a countrywide CORS network by end of 2020.

Further, the think tank advocates encouraging the implementation and usage of the IRNSS (or NavIC – the independent regional navigation satellite system developed by ISRO) in the larger domain of public services. This could include central services such as the railways and shipping. In addition, states can be encouraged to use IRNSS receivers as part of their public transportation systems such as buses and emergency services, among others.

To foster an environment of innovation, the think tank feels data should have minimum restrictions while respecting privacy, national security and commercial confidentiality. It feels that maps up to 1:25,000 and one meter resolution imagery should be made freely available. Standardisation of geospatial information while simplifying its access to enable use by many with scope for necessary customizations, addressing pressing issues around data such as privacy, security and sovereignty are among other recommendations from the think tank.

Geospatial foundational to New India vision

For a country like India that seeks to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024, leveraging the digital advancements by establishing a strong digital and geospatial data infrastructure are need of the hour. Integration of geospatial technology in the government’s ‘New India’ vision will enable the development of applications that enable efficient workflows across industries as agriculture, health, education, housing, disaster management, environment and urban development.

The growth driver for geospatial market in India is the thrust provided by the central and state government programs for developing a robust physical infrastructure, effective governance delivery, including e-governance and digital economy initiatives, integrated programs on urban and rural development such as Smart Cities, AMRUT, RURBAN clusters, National Hydrology Project (NHP) and integrated projects like Bharatmala and Sagarmala.

Interestingly, the Niti Aayog, in its vision document Strategy for New India@75, acknowledged the relevance and importance of spatial data and framework in the country’s growth and development. “The absence of a modern spatial planning framework, public utility design standards and land titling in cities takes a huge toll on economic growth and productivity, environmental sustainability and living conditions in cities,” it has said. Among other things, it has also identified complete digitization of land records, geo-tagging, along with location agnostic online registration of land records as hurdles. One of the key operational challenge areas in the Smart City Mission has also been identified as the non-availability of a robust spatial plans.

India’s geospatial industry

The Indian geospatial economy is valued at INR 20,629 crore ($3.07 billion; 100 crore is 1 billion). The Indian Geospatial Economy (IGE) Report 2018 had pegged the Indian geospatial market at INR 7,679 crore for 2017-18, which was likely to grow at 13.8% CAGR between FY 2017-18 and FY 2020-21.

Indian geospatial sector currently employs 250,000 people, out of which around 67,000 are engaged in exports-related services and around 40,000 are in government services. According to the think tank document, there are enormous employment generation opportunities in India for rudimentary services such as surveying, map digitization, content development, APIs, data analysis, etc.

The document refers to a study by the Expert Committee constituted by Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, which found that an approximate number of skilled manpower required for Digital India Land Records Modernization Program one state is 17,800. This means if the DI-LRMP Program is carried out at the national level, around 400,000 approximate skilled manpower is essential. It further estimates that effective implementation of geospatial technologies in all national development programs between 2019-2022 will roughly generate 1.2 million jobs.

Geospatial readiness and development

Highlighting the close correlation between geospatial readiness and national growth and development, the think tank pointed out that countries that are high in adoption of geospatial technologies stand to gain more than others in terms of contribution to GDP, standard of living for citizens and quality of infrastructure.

For instance, US, UK, Germany, Singapore and The Netherlands rank among the top ten on the Countries Geospatial Readiness Index (CGRI)-2019, while they also rank high on other parameters like global competitiveness, human development etc. CGRI ranks India at the 25th place. India’s rankings provides ample insights on the need for an integrated approach from government and national geospatial agencies for a holistic development of the sector. While India’s inability to fully harness the development and commercial opportunities is due to a combination of factors, the less-than-optimum role played by the national geospatial agencies is one of the key reasons."
Overseas Citizens of India Appear to Enjoy the Same Rights as Other Indians: Delhi HC,https://m.thewire.in/article/law/overseas-citizens-of-india-appear-to-enjoy-the-same-rights-as-other-indians-delhi-hc,"Aug 12, 2018  |  PTI","New Delhi: The Delhi high court has said that Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs) appear to enjoy the fundamental rights of equality before law and freedom of speech and expression in the same way as any other Indian citizen does.

The court’s observation came while asking the Centre to place before it the material based on which an intelligence report had recommended cancellation of the OCI registration of a US-based Indian-origin doctor.

Dr Christo Thomas Philip had challenged the cancellation of his OCI registration for alleged missionary activities in Bihar.

“In terms of section 7B (1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, all rights other than those specified in sub-section (2) of the said section are available to an OCI card holder. Although, Article 16 of the Constitution of India is specified in Section 7B (2) of the Act, Articles 14 and 19 are not included.

“Thus, prima facie, the rights under Article 14 (equality before law) and 19 (freedom of speech and expression) of the Constitution of India which are guaranteed to the citizen of India also appear to be extended to an OCI card holder,” Justice Vibhu Bakhru said.

The court issued the direction after finding that one of the facts, regarding the doctor’s place of birth, was “incorrect” in the report and there was no material on record to support the government assumption that he was acting as a medical missionary – the reason behind the cancellation of his OCI registration.

“The said report indicates that the petitioner was born in USA. This is stoutly disputed by the petitioner. He states that he was born in Kerala. Thus, one of the factual premise in the intelligence report appears to be incorrect.

Although, the report states that the petitioner has been acting as a medical missionary, there is no material on record, which supports this assumption,” the court said.

OCI is a scheme introduced in response to the demands for dual citizenship by the Indian diaspora.

The doctor, in his plea filed through advocates Robin David and Dhiraj Philip, claimed that the action was taken against him without any evidence and there was no basis for coming to the conclusion that he was involved in missionary and evangelical activities in India leading to unrest and law and order problems.

According to the petition, Philip was granted the OCI card and a lifelong visa by the government to visit India on November 22, 2012.

He claimed he visited India several times in the past to serve as a volunteer doctor with Duncan Hospital at Raxaul in Bihar from January 2014 till he was allegedly “unlawfully deported” on April 26, 2016 from the IGI Airport here.

He had moved the high court last year against his cancellation of OCI card by the Consulate General of India at Houston, US.

The court had asked him to approach the government against the Consulate General’s order and directed the authority concerned to decide his case “as expeditiously as possible”.

The revisional authority, which he had approached with his representation, on December 22 last year upheld the Consulate General’s decision.

In his present plea, the doctor challenged the revisional authority’s decision.

Apart from that, he also challenged the Consulate General’s August 1, 2017 decision to cancel his OCI card as well as the look-out circular issued against him.

He also sought directions to the authorities to permit him to visit his family members in Kerala."
"At 6-6.5%, Economic Survey 2020 Projects Cautiously Optimistic Growth Figures for FY’21",https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/economic-survey-2020-growth-figures-optimistic,"Jan 31, 2020  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: In what appears to be a slightly sunny estimate, India’s latest Economic Survey has predicted that the country’s GDP growth will be between 6% to 6.5% in the next fiscal year.

Almost every other major economic agency or organisation has forecast lower growth for FY’21. While the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank recently said that real GDP is expected to grow at 5.8% in FY’21, credit rating agency India Ratings believes it will be just 5.5%.

State Bank of India’s chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh has also forecast that FY’21 should see growth between 5.5% and 6%.

The Survey, which is an economic report card of the government and is prepared by the chief economic adviser, believes though that upside risks will prevail, especially because the Centre has the “capacity to deliver expeditiously on reforms”.

“On a net assessment, it appears that the upside risks should prevail, particularly when the government, with a strong mandate, has the capacity to deliver expeditiously on reforms. GDP growth of India should strongly rebound in 2020-21 and more so on a low statistical base of 5 per cent growth in 2019-20,” the Survey has said.

“On a net assessment of both the downside/upside risks, India’s GDP growth is expected to grow in the range of 6.0 to 6.5 per cent in 2020-21,” it adds.

The Economic Survey 2020, which was written by CEA Krishnamurthy Subramanian and his team, was presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in parliament on Friday afternoon.

The survey, which presents valuable data and theories on the state of the economy, hasn’t always been the most reliable predictor of economic growth though. Subramanaian’s last survey, for instance, forecast 7% growth for FY’20. This calculation, along with many others, proved to be wrong as a slowdown dragged India’s GDP growth for that fiscal to 5%."
"Kartarpur Corridor: India, Pakistan Officials Hold Technical Meeting",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/pakistan-india-kartarpur-corridor-meeting,"Apr 16, 2019  |  M. Zulqernain","Lahore: Pakistan and India on Tuesday held a technical meeting to discuss the modalities for the corridor linking Gurudwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district in Punjab.

Technical experts and foreign office officials from both sides participated in the talks held at Zero Point (Kartarpur), according to Geo News. They reportedly discussed the installation of a border fence and road design.

An official of the Pakistan Rangers told PTI that the meeting took place at the Kartarpur Zero Point, but said that a statement will be issued either by Pakistan’s Foreign Office or the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the Pakistan military.

In a major initiative last November, both India and Pakistan agreed to set up the Kartarpur Corridor to link the historic Gurdwara Darbar Sahib – the final resting place of Sikh faith’s founder Guru Nanak Dev – to Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur.

Kartarpur Sahib is located in Pakistan’s Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine.

Earlier, India had postponed the Kartarpur Corridor meeting between the two countries at the Wagah border, which was scheduled for April 2.

India and Pakistan, on March 19, held a meeting of technical experts on the Kartarpur corridor during which its alignment, coordinates and other engineering aspects of the proposed crossing points were discussed.

The technical meeting at the level of experts, including engineers and surveyors, was held at “proposed zero points” in the follow up to the decision reached on the March 14 meeting.

Later, the Pakistani Cabinet constituted a 10-member Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (PSGPC) to facilitate Sikh pilgrims after opening of the Kartarpur corridor.

India voiced concerns over the presence of several Khalistani separatists in the committee and said it will wait for a response from Islamabad on the issue and will not go ahead with a meeting on the corridor on April 2, as was previously agreed to, in Wagah on the Pakistani side.

During the previous meeting, both sides jointly surveyed the coordinates of the Zero Point and discussed the technical details, including finished road level, high flood level etc.

Pakistan will build the corridor from the Indian border to the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur while the other part, from Dera Baba Nanak in Indian Punjab’s Gurdaspur district up to the border, will be constructed by India.

In Pakistan, the groundbreaking ceremony of the corridor was performed on November 28 last year by Prime Minister Imran Khan.

50% of the four-kilometre stretch being built by Pakistan has been completed, while the stretch between the Zero Line to Baba Nanak’s shrine is being built by India.

The corridor will be opened in November this year in connection with the 550th birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak.

"Despite India's Boycott of BRF, China to Prepare For Summit With India",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-boycott-brf-china-summit,"Apr 19, 2019  |  K.J.M. Varma","Beijing: China said on Friday that it was preparing to hold a Wuhan-style summit with India this year despite India’s reported decision to boycott the 2nd Belt and Road Forum, to be held in Beijing next week, to protest its sovereignty concerns over the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Addressing a media conference ahead of the Belt and Road Forum (BRF) being held from April 25-27 to showcase China’s trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi made an impassioned appeal to India to shed its opposition to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it in no way “undermined” its basic position on the Kashmir dispute.

Wang said so far 37 heads of state and governments had confirmed their participation in the BRF. Representatives from over 150 countries, 90 international organisations’ and close to 5000 participants have confirmed their participation.

Leaders of Pakistan and Nepal are among the countries from the neighbourhood who would take part in the BRF meeting being held from April 25-27.

India has already signalled to boycott the BRF like it did in 2017 to highlight its objections over the CPEC.

The CPEC which has been officially designated as a flagship project of the BRI, has become a stumbling block for India to take part in it as the controversial project is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

India has already protested over the CPEC violating its sovereignty and had boycotted the first BRF held in 2017.

Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri told Chinese state-run Global Times last month that “above all, connectivity initiatives must be pursued in a manner that respects sovereignty, equality and territorial integrity of nations. No country can participate in an initiative that ignores its core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

Answering a question on whether India’s reported decision to boycott the BRF would undermine the new momentum generated by last year’s informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Wang said the two leaders had a very successful meeting at Wuhan.

“Particularly they have established mutual trust and jointly planned for the future of improvement and strengthening of China-India relations.”

“After the Wuhan summit, we have seen progress between the two countries and there are bright prospects for this relationship. We are now preparing for the next summit of our leaders,” he said without specifying any time line.

Xi plans to visit India for a second summit after the general elections, currently underway, are over.

Wang said China and India were two major countries, besides being neighbours.

“It is natural for us to have differences. This is only natural. I remember Prime Minister Modi mentioning many times that we cannot let our differences escalate into disputes. It would not do for our differences to interfere in the development of our relations,” he said.

“I believe this is in the fundamental interest of the people of the two countries and that is what China is happy to see,” he said.

“One of our differences is on how to look at the BRI. The Indian side has their concerns. We understand that and that is why we have stated clearly on many occasions that the BRI, including the CPEC, is only an economic initiative and it does not target any third country and has nothing to do with the sovereign and territorial disputes between any two countries,” he said.

The BRI is a multi-billion-dollar initiative launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping when he came to power in 2013. It aims to link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes.

“India has its basic position on these disputes. Our cooperation will not undermine any party’s position on those issues,” Wang said, apparently suggesting that it would not alter even Pakistan’s position on the disputed status of the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

China for its part has been maintaining that the Kashmir dispute is left over from history and it should be resolved between India and Pakistan.

“Now we are trying to achieve common prosperity through cooperation under the BRI. Those issues left over from history must be separated from our efforts in this area.”

“I think such cooperation will not undermine India’s basic position on sovereignty and territorial integrity and at the same time it will provide more opportunities of development and help India in its modernisation endeavour. I believe this is a good option and choice for India,” Wang said.

The minister said that if Indians stranded in the Libyan capital do not leave immediately, then it may not be possible to evacuate them later.

Over 200 people were killed in Tripoli in the last two weeks since renegade Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar’s troops launched a strike to oust UN-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj from power.

Swaraj tweeted, “Even after massive evacuation from Libya and the travel ban, there are over 500 Indian nationals in Tripoli. The situation in Tripoli is deteriorating fast. Presently, flights are operational.”

“Pls ask your relatives and friends to leave Tripoli immediately. We will not be able to evacuate them later,” she said on her Twitter handle."
"Even Diwali May Not Lift India Inc's Earnings, Warn Analysts Amid Economic Slowdown",https://m.thewire.in/article/business/india-earnings-economic-slowdown,"Aug 06, 2019  |  Chris Thomas and Gaurav Dogra","Bengaluru: India Inc has turned in its most disappointing quarterly numbers in at least three years and analysts warn hopes for any festive season cheer are likely to be dashed by a slowing economy.

More than 60% of 125 firms that have reported so far, and are tracked by analysts, missed profit forecasts for the June quarter, the most since at least 2016, Refinitiv data shows.

India‘s biggest lenders and automakers have all sounded warning bells over the slower growth in demand and consumption.

“It’s going to be a gloomy Diwali. Things are not going to change immediately in the next two or three months,” said Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities.

The Indian festive season, which starts in September and runs through the end of the year, is the biggest sales season for companies. It typically peaks around Diwali, or the festival of lights, in October.

But this time, the outlook for the period is subdued after India‘s economy grew at the slowest pace in more than four years in the January-March quarter. An erratic monsoon, high rates of unemployment and a liquidity crisis in the shadow banking sector have added to the uncertainty.

“Consumers are currently postponing their purchases because of the general slowdown,” said Neeraj Dewan, director, Quantum Securities.

Consumer goods giant Hindustan Unilever has warned demand will “remain subdued given macroeconomic conditions”.

The benchmark Nifty index has dropped more than 10% since hitting an all-time high in early June and is the fourth-worst performer among its major Asian peers so far this year.

“The growth engine is slowing down, which is why we are seeing a sell-off,” Samco’s Mehta said.

Automakers have been among the worst hit by the slump in demand, with monthly auto sales in India down 17-20% since April. Preliminary data shows overall car sales in the country may have dropped as much as 30% in July. Tata Motors, India‘s top automaker by revenue, posted a bigger-than-expected loss for the June quarter. Rival Maruti Suzuki, which managed to top estimates aided by cost cuts, saw an 18% drop in sales.

Gopal Mahadevan, finance head at truck maker Ashok Leyland, has said the lower auto sales have “more to do with the general economic condition” and not a demand problem.

Among the few bright spots for the quarter was Johnny Walker and Smirnoff maker Diageo, which reported an 8% rise in sales in India, led by strong demand for scotch. Its subsidiary, United Spirits, posted a near 10% rise in sales.

“The lipstick effect, which indicates consumers spend more on low-ticket luxury and instant gratification items during a crisis, could be at play here,” said Gnanasundaram Saminathan, a research analyst at Spark Capital Advisors.

"Indian-Origin Man in UK Harasses Woman Over Five Years, Sent to Jail for Six Years",https://m.thewire.in/article/women/indian-origin-man-in-uk-harasses-woman-over-five-years-sent-to-jail-for-six-years,"Oct 29, 2018  |  Aditi Khanna","London: An Indian-origin man who waged a long campaign of harassment and intimidation against a woman in London has been sentenced to six years.

Sirtaj Bhangal, 35, was jailed at Isleworth Crown Court in London on Friday, October 26, after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence; two counts of witness intimidation and breach of a restraining order.

“Sirtaj Bhangal launched an unprovoked, sustained campaign of intimidation against his victim which covered a period of five years, including a time when he was on remand in prison,” said Detective Constable Nicola Kerry from the Metropolitan Police West Area Command Unit, who led the investigation.

“The motive for this remains unclear and makes the intensity of his harassment all the more terrifying. I would like to praise the victim and her family for supporting this investigation and I can only hope that Bhangal’s imprisonment can offer them some small form of comfort,” she said.

Bhangal’s campaign against the unnamed victim started in 2013 when he began to contact her via social media despite the fact that the pair had not met.

The tone of Bhangal’s messages were demeaning and the victim blocked him from her accounts, the Met Police said.

Over the course of the next three years, Bhangal sporadically contacted the victim but this intensified in 2016 when he sent her a nine-page letter intimating he would be upset if she ignored it.

Over the next year, the one-sided contact intensified through phone calls and texts and culminated with Bhangal approaching the victim and then hand-delivering another letter to the victim’s address in May 2017.

The victim then reported the matter to police and Bhangal was arrested and charged. He was subsequently convicted of harassment and stalking.

While on remand awaiting trial, Bhangal used an illegal mobile phone in prison to call the victim and threaten her with violence. Bhangal was subsequently charged with witness intimidation and a trial set for July this year.

However, on July 3, the victim found an 80-page letter at her home address; the contents were extremely disturbing and again threatened the victim and her family with extreme violence including having acid thrown at them. The letter also contained images of people who had been injured with corrosive substances alongside images of the victim taken from social media.

A search of Bhangal’s address was undertaken and items including imitation firearms, imitation grenades, Samurai swords and packaging from acidic substances were recovered.

Bhangal was further charged with the firearm offence and a second count of witness intimidation.

Why Is India Missing Out on Top UN Positions?,https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/un-positions-pose-dilemma-rising-power-india,"May 18, 2017  |  Shastri Ramachandran","The nodal ministries deciding India’s role at the UN lack the skill for negotiations in international forums. Consequently, India lags behind in holding top positions like director general of the UN.

New Delhi: The government of India has no clear-cut stand and approach when it comes to campaigning for positions in the UN including specialised agencies of the world body and formations such as the Group of 77 (G77). The reason, according to informed sources and diplomats who have had a ringside view of past campaigns, is that the “calculated ambivalence” has served India’s interests “up to expectations and beyond”.

What importance does New Delhi attach to the G77? How much is India interested in G77 comprising 134 developing countries including China? When posed these two questions, all officials – both serving and retired diplomats – agreed to respond on condition of anonymity. The only exception was India’s former UN under-secretary general Shashi Tharoor, currently member of parliament from Thiruvananthapuram, capital of the southern state of Kerala.

Tharoor said that his Congress party and the United Progress Alliance it had helmed for ten years in government “certainly attached a great deal of importance to the G77, a body which India often led at the UN as the ‘global trade union of developing countries’. However, as the G20, the global ‘management’ of the world’s economy, grew in importance, there has inevitably been some diminishing of the prominence given to the G77.”

Tharoor, who had served as India’s minister of state of external affairs under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is well-regarded across the political spectrum. Even the current regime headed by BJP’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sought to utilise Tharoor’s diplomatic and drafting expertise when it comes to critical issues with a hostile neighbour such as Pakistan.

China, UNIDO and India

How far is India interested in top positions like director general of UN organisations, as for example, United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) in Vienna?

Tharoor – who moved out after 29 years at the UN when he came second to Ban Ki-moon in the elections (in 2006) for the secretary-general – told IDN-INPS that India is certainly interested in UN leadership positions. “India mounts a campaign only when there is buy-in at the political level,” he said. “Understandably, we tend to throw our hat in the ring only when we are reasonably confident of majority support. But, sometimes, New Delhi’s indifference can mean India missing out on a position we could have won.”

UNIDO’s current director-general is China’s Li Yong, who was appointed in 2013 with strong backing from the government in Beijing. Much to the dismay of many diplomats in Vienna, Li is said to be recruiting Chinese to senior positions in UNIDO.

However, at least one official who was asked for his reaction appeared least perturbed by this development. “We do not have to meet the expectations of the West when it comes to China’s role in these bodies,” said a diplomat who recently retired in the rank of secretary from India’s ministry of external affairs (MEA). He has served in the mission to the UN and as ambassador in a major Asian and western capital.

This veteran of many tricky diplomatic negotiations revealed that it is nothing unusual for India to be encouraged by “interested powers” and their camps to contest against contenders from China and Iran. These two countries are “targeted” for a variety of historical, political, strategic and cultural reasons by the West.

Earlier, in February this year, when Iran’s permanent representative (PR) to the UN in Vienna, Reza Najafi, was consensus choice to Chair the G77 for a one-year term, the outcome was attributed to India’s “lack of interest”. A former foreign secretary said the MEA knew that a few PRs to the UN in Vienna wanted the Indian envoy, Renu Pall – who had presented her credentials in February 2017 – as the chair of the G77’s Vienna chapter. However, New Delhi did not appear “enthusiastic”.

G77

A former permanent representative of India to the UN said that India held the G77 chair first in 1970. “After that we have not held the chair with a view to encourage stakeholdership and participation of smaller developing countries; as a way of democratising participation.” He pointed out that India is one of the “institutional leaders” of G77 with a decisive leadership role.

“For example, in 2013, India led the consensus in finalising the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at Rio+20. Our influence is not always determined by a formal position.” He emphasised that “India is a strong presence. The success of SDGs is India’s contribution.”

A former foreign secretary, who is well acquainted with the matter, said that India has been part of the G77 Experts Group, which works towards finalising a common position on issues before taking it to the others. In his view, New Delhi has desisted from openly pushing for top UN positions because as a “Rising Power”, such positions should come to India without campaigning. “The strength of our presence and the force of our influence should speak; and, should be reflected in India being persuaded to take on leadership roles,” was his view.

Nodal ministries disempower the diplomatic spearhead

Another former permanent representative to the UN said that if India is not occupying a few top UN positions today, it is because this is no longer an issue that can be clinched by the MEA. “Ten years ago, the MEA was the diplomatic spearhead. It set the direction and shaped India’s role in the UN and UN organisations. Today, this is done by a variety of nodal ministries ranging from finance and commerce to energy and environment besides the Prime Minister’s Office.”

These ministries, he said, lack the diplomatic expertise to steer India and Indians to top positions in UN organisations, and they do not wish to concede leadership to MEA in areas they guard as their turf. As a result, said another diplomat, India’s profile does not reflect its real influence, which is much more. This official said that while nodal ministries have the technical expertise and subject competence, they are not skilled in making a diplomatic pitch within a policy framework; and, they are also lacking in the diplomatic capability and finesse for negotiations in international forums. Thus, the diminished importance of the MEA has had its adverse effects.

Another diplomat who had served in major world capitals and the UN – and enjoyed the confidence of successive prime ministers – said that India is very active in G77 as it is in other UN organisations. “But, at times, we want to stay apart. We don’t want to be tied to collective positions on all issues such as, for example, climate change. Similarly, on SDGs, although India led the consensus, there were a few objectives on which India had reservations.”

A powerful presence with a decisive say

There are advantages and disadvantages in being tied to collective position. “In recent years, India has more often had reasons to not be tied to collective positions. This does not mean that India is any way less influential. It is a powerful presence with a decisive say,” he added.

A former ambassador to China, who has also worked with the UN, said that New Delhi does not share the Western view of China and Iran, and does not find it necessary to be pitted against these countries when India’s interests are not affected.

“In fact, more often than not, India has shared interests with Iran and China. China is not a problem for India at all times and in all forums as the West may imagine or would want it to be. There are strategic, political and geopolitical issues where China and India differ but these don’t surface in all forums,” he said.

Another former foreign secretary, who has served as ambassador to the US, said that India is interested in positions but not given to campaigning. India wants to avoid too many trials of strength as it can create “credibility problems”. He emphasised that there is no problem in “attaining our objectives”, especially when it comes to India’s special interests.

Tharoor said that India’s special interests obviously vary from agency to agency. But successive governments have tended to have a fairly consistent view about what is “good for India”.

An informed observer, who was close to the prime minister’s office until a few years ago, best summed up the situation: “When it comes to the UN and multilateral forums, we are where we want to be. We are not where we were in the 1990s. Today’s India would like to keep its options open in many situations and retain elbow room without the straitjacket of a formal leadership position.”

"Australia, Canada, UK Issue New Travel Advisories for India",https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/australia-canada-uk-issue-new-travel-advisories-for-india,"Sep 21, 2016  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: Australia, Canada and the UK have issued fresh advisories to their citizens travelling to India to avoid visiting parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Nagaland, Tripura, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and the India-Pakistan border, barring the Wagah border.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) of the UK and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also warned their citizens about the recent Cauvery dispute-related violence.

On September 16, the FCO updated its travel advisory cautioning its citizens “against all travel to Jammu and Kashmir with the exception of travel within the city of Jammu, travel by air to Jammu and travel within the region of Ladakh.” It also advised “against all but essential travel” to Srinagar and travel between the cities of Jammu and Srinagar on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway.

The advisory said, “The tourist destinations of Phalgam, Gulmarg and Sonmarg fall within the areas to which the FCO advises against all travel.”

The same day, Global Affairs Canada also advised its citizens against travelling to “Jammu and Kashmir, with the exception of Ladakh via Manali or by air to Leh, due to sporadic terrorist activity and violent demonstrations.” Besides, “areas within the immediate vicinity of the border with Pakistan, in the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Punjab, due to the possibility of landmines and unexploded ordnance, as well as unmarked border areas.”

It said, “The Wagah border crossing and towns farther from the border, such as Amritsar in Punjab and Bikaner and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, are excluded from this advisory.” FCO also kept Wagah out of the advisory.

In the case of the north eastern state, the countries’ advisories have asked their citizens to either cancel or reconsider their visit to these states citing recent militant attacks: the shooting of 14 people in a market in Assam’s Kokrajhar district this past August and the killing of 18 soldiers in Manipur’s Thoubal district last year.

Global Affairs Canada advised against “non-essential travel” to “Manipur and the areas of Arunachal Pradesh that border with Myanmar, due to the threat of insurgency” besides advising travelers to also avoid areas in Assam bordering Bangladesh and Nagaland bordering Myanmar “as they are significantly affected by insurgency.”

A large number of tourists from these three countries visit the north east every year, particularly Assam’s Kaziranga National Park, home to the one-horned rhino.

In 2013, a similar travel advisory was issued by Australia. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said, “We continue to recommend Australians to exercise a high degree of caution in India overall because of the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, crime and vehicle accidents.”

“Possible targets include public places in New Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities, and Indian security and political interests. Major secular and religious holidays could provide terrorist groups an opportunity or pretext to stage an attack,” the advisory added. However, the overall advice for Jammu and Kashmir and north eastern parts of India was similar to the past ones."
"Behind GST’S Anti-Profiteering Provisions, A Legacy Of Indian Socialism",https://m.thewire.in/article/business/gsts-anti-profiteering-provisions-lndian-socialism,"Jul 04, 2017  |  Shubhang Setlur","While the government can justify various anti-profiteering measures based on socialist principles, the rules and methodology need to be clearly stated.

Nearly 70 years after B.R. Ambedkar and K.T. Shah debated over whether the Indian constitution should include the word ‘socialist’ – the former was in favour of a society being organised by the people of India, according to the time and circumstances – anti-profiteering provisions present in the country’s plan to overhaul a broken tax system remind us of this very debate.

The primary objective of the goods and services tax (GST) is to remove the cascading effect of existing taxes, that is tax on tax. The core principle of the GST is based on the fact that the tax on any input or input service utilised during the process of developing a product or a service would have to be offset against the subsequent output tax paid. The seamless credit system has been formulated keeping the consumer in mind and removes inefficiencies in the supply chain.

However, what if an entity in the supply chain, for instance, a wholesaler, decides to take benefit of a reduced tax rate courtesy the GST and not pass on such benefit to a consumer by hiking up his profit?

To counter such undue benefit, the government inserted Section 171 into the Central Goods and Services Tax Act (CGST). Section 171 of the CGST specifies that any benefit availed through extra input tax credit (as against earlier) or a reduction in rate of tax on any supply of goods or services has to be passed on to the consumer commensurately.

India Inc’s primary objection to anti-profiteering lies around the fact that it adds an additional compliance burden, and that more importantly, a reduction in rate of taxes of inputs or input services need not necessarily result in a proportionate reduction in the final price of a product or service.

While industry concerns are certainly legitimate – especially after taking into account the Modi government’s ‘minimum government, maximum governance’ motto – is there any mechanism to ensure that the consumer does become a beneficiary of GST?

Australia, Malaysia examples

Chapter XIX of the CGST, which deals with ‘Offences and Penalties’, does not provide for a mechanism to ensure a commensurate reduction in the final price of a product. Australia and Malaysia are closest international examples when it comes to understanding anti-profiteering measures. The Australian anti-profiteering measure was based on the net dollar margin rule method – that is, if taxes and costs fell by $1, then prices should also fall by at least $1. The Malaysian example is formula-based and uses a net profit margin which considers the effect of net profit on a comparative basis with a base rate net profit. For instance, the net profit margin from April 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016 (excluding GST taxes) should not exceed the net profit margin as on April 1, 2016 (base rate).

On June 20, the GST council notified the Anti Profiteering Rules, 2017 (rules). The rules currently do not contain the methodology and procedure for determining whether commensurate benefit has been passed on to consumers. However, the language used mostly mirrors the Australian model. The rules contain the bare essentials of a statute – with a three tier structure for determination of alleged anti profiteering –with the apex body being the ‘Anti-Profiteering Authority’. Penal action under the rules can even entail cancellation of GST registration.

It should be noted that a substantial chunk of the basket of items in the consumer price index have been exempted from payment of GST. Stemming from experience in other countries, the inflationary effects of GST could be high in the initial years of its implementation.

To what extent is this justified? On the face of it, the government can certainly rely on the concept of a welfare state based on socialist principles to justify various anti-profiteering measures. The Supreme Court has also time and again upheld the concept of securing and protecting a social order which comprises of economic justice as well. When examined from the pointed perspectives of a consumer and from a tangible benefit to the economy, the anti-profiteering authority may well be justified.

Industry issues are focused around feasibility of the measures and its implementation, and potential harassment at the hands of the taxman. What could have been done perhaps is have the Competition Commission, which examines pricing in detail, study how the passing of commensurate benefit could be ensured.

However, from a legislative standpoint, the argument against anti-profiteering rewinds back to the debate on socialism, and importantly on an ideal which India arguably believes in as a legacy. Importantly, the rules have been worded from the perspective of a need-based manner, which mostly would be required in the case of oligopolistic markets. Given the vogue nature of the GST and the risk and accountability that the government has towards the second largest consumer base in the world, the government cannot be entirely blamed for introducing an anti-profiteering measure.

Taxation statutes are most susceptible to the slightest change in an economic environment – a close case in point being the negative list of services in service tax wherein the government, in a single stroke, changed 18 years of grappling with an arduous memory recall exercise of adding services on a year-on-year basis to a catch-all means to cover all taxation services.

As a parting thought, had the wording of the statute been “Input Tax Credit-Commensurate Benefit Rules”, would industry reaction have been different?

India’s Forex Reserves See Biggest Weekly Loss In Seven Years,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/indias-forex-reserves-see-biggest-weekly-loss-in-seven-years,"Oct 21, 2018  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India’s foreign exchange reserves saw their biggest weekly loss since November 2011, as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened heavily in the currency market to shore up an embattled rupee.

The domestic currency is under pressure due to concern over the government’s ability to finance its current account deficit (CAD) in the face of high global oil prices.

Forex reserves dropped by $5.14 billion in the seven days ended October 12, show data released by the RBI on Friday.The forex reserves stood at $394.46 billion as on October 12, down 7.5% from the peak of $426.08 billion as on April 13.

Rising oil prices have fueled worry about the Modi government’s ability to finance CAD, leading to flight of foreign capital. That has hit market sentiments about the rupee.

The rupee has fared worst among all Asian currencies, falling more than 14% against the US dollar during this year, forcing the RBI to sell dollars in the market to support the beleaguered domestic currency. After breaching 74 against the greenback, the rupee has regained some lost ground. It closed at 73.32 against the dollar on Friday.

This data “clearly indicates significant intervention from the central bank and they now seem to be drawing a line in the sand,” Mint quoted Anindya Banerjee, a foreign-exchange analyst at Kotak Securities in Mumbai, as saying.

It shows the central bank doesn’t want to see the rupee go beyond 74 to the dollar, Banerjee added.

"China, India and the World After Trump",https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/china-india-and-the-world-after-trump,"Nov 24, 2016  |  Shyam Saran","In the next decade, how US-China relations unfold will shape the external environment for countries like India. Much will depend on how China perceives the Trump presidency.

We are today at a true inflexion point in international affairs. Europe is disoriented and in disarray thanks to Brexit. The US under president-elect Donald Trump is likely to see significant discontinuities from the past. Just recently, he has announced that after his inauguration, he will give notice for the US’s withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), that he will permit the resumption of coal mining and coal-based thermal power plants, and that he will ask the department of labour to begin registering illegal migrants who will be deported. He has, therefore, left no one in doubt that he intends to deliver on at least some of his campaign promises. So we will see departures from past US policies and there will be resultant uncertainty.

By contrast, China appears as relatively stable, predictable and even positive factor as the international landscape continues to be transformed. At the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima, the US and China seemed to have undergone a role reversal, with the US under Trump expected to head in the direction of greater protectionism, while President Xi Jinping promised an even more open China, championed free trade and pushed for a APEC-wide mega-regional trade regime. With the US-led TPP already in limbo, China’s initiative for a more inclusive Asia-Pacific Free Trade Agreement has begun to look positively enticing, even to the major trade partners of the US.

In the next decade, how US-China relations unfold will shape the external environment for countries like India. Much will depend on how China perceives the Trump presidency.

I believe that China looks upon the Trump presidency as an opportunity to further expand China’s regional and international profile. There may be anxiety over Trump’s threats to impose punitive tariffs on imports from China and to declare China a “currency manipulator”. However, China believes that the more than half a trillion dollars of US-China bilateral trade, significant investments by US firms in China and Chinese holdings of a large volume of US treasury securities represent equities which will restrain a Trump administration from damaging the US-China economic relationship, because the damage to US interests will also be large. So the Chinese believe that the threat on the economic and trade front may be limited. On the other hand, they welcome a possible retrenchment of US military presence in the Asia-Pacific, which Trump has signaled, with the loosening of US security ties with both allies and partners in the region. Since China believes that its dominant position in the region is constrained mainly by US power, a relative decline of that power would be welcome to China. It would, however, expect a graduated and steady decline so as not to trigger a possible acquisition of nuclear weapons by Japan and perhaps South Korea as well, which would impact Chinese security negatively. If trends are indeed in this direction, I expect pressures on Southeast Asia to increase and more activism on the Taiwan issue is likely.

The Russia question

Against this background, a US-Russia détente would be welcome from an Indian perspective. To the extent that Europe was following an American lead in trying to isolate and sanction Russia, a Trump outreach to Putin may revive the many political and economic links that had developed between post-Cold War Russia and European partners, in particular Germany. Russia has always wanted to be accepted as a European power, rather than be treated as an interloper on its margins. If this is once again on the horizon, Russia’s traditional anxieties about a resurgent China may well resurface. This may introduce a degree of balance in what may otherwise appear as the beginning of a Chinese decade.

Some analysts believe that economic imbalances in China are reaching a point where a crisis is possible; an economic slowdown is inevitable. Nevertheless, the Chinese economy has now achieved a degree of maturity and diversity; the management of the economy is remarkably sophisticated and the capacity for creative innovation and technological progress is evident. Even if the Chinese economy suffers a setback, it has accumulated the human and technological resources and the infrastructure to enable it to bounce back. I do not agree that China’s capacity for such creativity demands political democracy. Joseph Needham’s work would lead us to a different conclusion.

Chinese politics is likely to trend towards authoritarianism. In Chinese perception, internal peace and prosperity have flourished in times of strong centralised and indeed, expanding empire. In its absence there has been misery and chaos. This is hard-wired into the Chinese psyche. I do not foresee China following an East Asian model of economic prosperity leading to some recognisable form of representative democracy. Chinese politics is brittle and there have been major disruptions in the past, but I believe this is now less likely.

New role for India?

So what does this mean for India in the next decade? The management of India-China relations has become more complex, more challenging than at any time in the history of independent India. There will need to be a fine distinction between treating China an adversary, which it obviously is and will remain for the foreseeable future, and casting it in the role of an enemy. In acknowledging its role as an adversary, one will inevitably have to fashion a nuanced mix of engagement and resistance, and this mix will change as India’s own co-relation with China changes and the regional and global environment continues to evolve. In the decade ahead, I envisage the power gap between India and China in terms of both economic and military capabilities remaining large and even expanding. China’s economy, after all, is already five times that of India. This would suggest a policy of prudence, not provocation; caution and avoidance of bravado. On the contested border, we need to deploy both air and ground capabilities, which could render any Chinese military probing or something more significant a risky affair with unpredictable outcomes for the Chinese.

There should be no hesitation in continuing to strengthen security arrangements with the US, which even with its power in relative decline, would remain the indispensable global power with unmatched technological and military capabilities. The changed environment in the region will create opportunities for India, even as it does for China. Japan, Southeast Asia and Australia would welcome an expanded Indian footprint in the region and there may be greater willingness to seek expanded security, maritime cooperation with India in particular. These relationships need to be pursued with greater vigour and we should not be inhibited by anxieties over Chinese adverse reaction. Chinese restraint is more likely if India has a stronger network of political, economic and security relationships with major powers and other partners in the region, rather than if such a network was weakened by the fear of China. A relatively isolated India is likely to be more vulnerable to Chinese pressure than otherwise.

And the engagement aspect remains critically important, even though there may be points of enhanced contestation such as stronger Chinese alliance with Pakistan, its opposition to India’s NSG membership and other similar issues. India’s membership of G-20, SCO, BRICS and the India-China-Russia trilateral are very useful platforms for engaging China and providing opportunities for regular meetings at the top leadership level. These summits are important. Our experience over the past decade has been that such summit meetings have lent a degree of stability to the relationship and enabled both countries to manage a complex and sometimes fractious relationship. In the decade to come, such leadership engagement will become even more important.

"India's GST, Hyped as Another Tryst With Destiny, Remains a Half-Way House of Disruptions",https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/indias-gst-hyped-another-tryst-destiny-remains-half-way-house-disruptions,"Dec 30, 2017  |  Noor Mohammad","If anything, GST has proved a nightmare for businesses in the short-term, especially for those in the informal sector.

As we bid farewell to 2017, The Wire looks back at some of the markers of disruption that affected different spheres, from politics and economics to technology and films.

The central hall of parliament was the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s choice of venue for the launch of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. A midnight session on June 30, 2017, in what could only be construed as a throwback to the historic ‘tryst with destiny speech’ delivered by India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru to the Constituent Assembly on August 14, 1947.

However, as The Wire had indicated at the time, the GST has failed to live up to the hype. If anything, it has proved a nightmare for businesses in the short-term, especially for those in the informal sector. In the run-up to the launch, the Modi government roped in film star Amitabh Bachchan, often tapped to help spread awareness about the Centre’s programmes, to star in a host of videos that all promised “one nation, one tax and one market”.

Unfortunately, much like GST itself, this is true only in word and not in spirit. While there are a number of procedural and technical reasons that have proven responsible in making GST troublesome for India’s informal economy, the single most overarching problem is that the Indian GST is much more complicated than what other countries have implemented. It has as many as six tax rates unlike other countries where a single rate prevails.

Moreover, both the Centre and states have the power to collect tax in India unlike other countries where this authority is vested in a single agency.

This is primarily why India’s GST also remains just a half-way house, with major items of consumption for industry like petrol and diesel, natural gas and electricity still outside its ambit. That means companies which these products as raw materials cannot avail input tax credit.

In the weeks and months after it was rolled out, the tax reform led to disrupted supply chains and hit exports hard as small businesses found it too complicated to comply with. Exporters saw their working capital requirement shoot up in the wake of GST roll-out on July 1 due to accumulation of unpaid input tax credits and reduction in duty drawback rates on their products.

Following India’s switch to GST, exports have witnessed an uneven monthly growth trend. Merchandise exports showed a negative growth of 1.12% in October. Exports from labour intensive sectors like gems and jewellery, apparels and leather and leather products reported precipitous drops during the month, raising a spectre of massive job losses.

Ironically, this came at a time when the global trade was in a boom phase. As per the latest forecast by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), global trade is likely to grow by 3.6% in 2017, up from the lacklustre 1.3% growth in 2016. While India’s exports have rebounded in November, encouraging some economists to express optimism that the industry might have shrugged off negative impact of GST, the picture is far from clear. A sustained trend of growth in exports is yet to be seen.

Intensive help

In the last few months, as state elections grew closer, the Modi government simplified compliance procedures and rules to provide relief to the industry. However, there is no end in sight to the woes of the country’s exporters.

Ajay Sahai, director general and CEO, Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), told The Wire, “The refund process has slightly improved as compared to October but still thousands of exporters are waiting for their July refund. Even customs and tax authorities are unable to tell the reasons for delay. For ITC, refund has been symbolic.” Sahai added, “The declarations are redundant; the refund is based on nexus, not on the formula prescribed and documents are not clearly listed. These have compounded exporters’ problems.”

Anil Bhardwaj, secretary general, Federation of Micro and Small and Medium Enterprises (FISME), too has flagged similar concerns. “While in the beginning MSMEs struggled with registration and filings, now the challenges they face remain in invoice matching, claiming refunds and making corrections. Absence of real-time support during filing or payments means if you make mistake, you are stuck,” Bhardwaj told The Wire.

“While a lot has improved, the GST framework is a still a long way to offer ease of working with GST,” he added.

Critics maintain that the GST was rolled out in haste. They cite its frequent tinkering by the GST council to buttress their argument. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which form the backbone of the country’s manufacturing sector, were hit hard. Garment exporters say their export competitiveness has fallen due to the increase in working capital requirement and reduction in incentives. As per industry estimates, Indian garment exports have become 8-10% costlier after GST roll-out, which is hurting exporters’ margins as well as sales volumes.

Alarmed over the sharp decline in October exports, the government has offered more incentives to help stem the bleeding for besieged garment exporters. Post-GST rates for claiming rebate of state taxes under the scheme for remission of state levies (RoSL) on exports of readymade garments and made-ups have been announced. The government has also doubled the rates for incentives under merchandise export from India (MEIS) scheme to 4%.

New MEIS rates are effective from November 1.

Post-GST rates of RoSL are up to a maximum of 1.70% for cotton garments, 1.25% for man-made fibre, silk and woollen garments and 1.48% for apparel of blends.

As part of the mid-term trade review policy for 2015-2020 early this month, the government has announced fresh export incentives to labour-intensive sectors and services, which would cost the exchequer Rs 8,450 crore annually. Meanwhile, the commerce ministry is working on a relief package for gems and jewellery exporters. The ministry has already asked the gems and jewellery industry to work out a proper business plan to promote growth of the sector.

“We have some time left, in another few weeks we have to finalise it as Budget will be in February, so we have to work on that (relief package for gems and jewellery exporters),” commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu said recently. The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council has demanded that import duty on gold should be slashed to 4% from the current 10% level.

The trade body is mindful of the government’s concern that a lower import duty could lead to a spurt in gold imports but hopes that a cut would be finally made as a trade-off. Another MSME-dominated sector, leather industry, estimates that it would need additional capital of over Rs 3,000 crore following implementation of the GST. There is a fear in the industry that many units could close down due to failure to raise capital.

The Council for Leather Exports, an industry body, has demanded that Centre’s duty drawback scheme for leather exporters should be extended till March 2018 as exporters’ capital was blocked on account of GST payment.

The industry body also wants the GST on finished leather goods and job work reduced to 5% from the current level of 12% and 18% respectively.

Softening the blow

In successive meetings, the GST council has approved comprehensive changes to smoothen the hard edges off the new tax regime. To this end, it has significantly reduced number of products under the highest rate of 28%. The council also relaxed return filing rules for MSMEs, deferred the controversial reverse charge mechanism until the next fiscal and hastened tax refunds for exporters hit by cash crunch.

The GST council on October 6 slashed rates on 27 items and 12 services, and introduced sweeping changes in GST rules to calm panic among small enterprises and exporters who were struggling with procedural tangles, refunds and technical glitches while filing returns on GSTN portal.

Specifically, the annual turnover threshold on the composition scheme has been raised from Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore.

Under the scheme, traders, manufacturers and restaurants can pay tax at 1, 2 and 5%, respectively. The turnover threshold has been increased by the government to ease the compliance burden for taxpayers as they will have to file returns on a quarterly basis, not every month as required for normal taxpayers.

However, unlike normal tax payers, dealers cannot avail input tax credit. About 15.5 lakh assessees with a turnover of less than Rs 1 crore have opted for the composition scheme, as per official data. Again in its meeting on November 10, the council pruned the list of product categories under 28% slab to 50 from 178 earlier.

These rapid changes have not been without consequences. Indirect tax collections this fiscal are feared to dip below the Centre’s target due to disruption caused by GST, which has in turn cast doubt over the government’s ability to meet the fiscal deficit target of 3.2%.

The Centre plans on collecting Rs 9.68 lakh crore from indirect taxes in the current fiscal while a mop-up of Rs 9.8 lakh crore has been targeted from direct taxes. Direct tax collections increased by 14.4% to Rs 4.8 lakh crore during April-November this fiscal. However, GST collection (indirect taxes) in October at Rs 83,346 crore was Rs 12,000 crore less compared to the preceding month and the lowest since the July 1 roll-out.

According to government sources, uncertainty prevails over whether tax realisation would be as per budget estimates in the remaining months of the fiscal. The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) has also privately warned the Centre that indirect tax collections could fall short of target due to disruption caused by the GST.

N.R. Bhanumurthy, Professor, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) told The Wire that the Centre’s tax collection target might not be realised due to uncertainty relating to GST. He, however, added that it was too early to say whether the government would be able to meet the fiscal deficit target or not.

With long-awaited revival of private investment nowhere in sight, the government is banking on increased public spending to support the economic recovery. GDP growth inched back to 6.3% in the second quarter after slumping to 5.7% in April-June period. If the government tightens its purse strings now, the economic recovery could derail, hitting jobs.

Job creation prospects are already dim, with labour intensive sectors like agriculture, construction and continuing to remain in the doldrums.

Agriculture GDP growth slowed to 1.7% in the second quarter from 2.3% in April-June period. The construction sector grew by 2.6% in the July-September quarter, slightly up from 2% in the preceding quarter.

Road ahead

The Centre is keen to bring remaining items like alcohol, petrol and diesel, natural gas, electricity and real estate under GST. However, doing so would be challenging for it given that states’ nod is needed for making any change in the GST. These items contribute a significant chunk of states’ tax revenues and so they are likely to resist any move to include them in GST.

The Centre too is mindful of the difficulty. For example, finance minister Arun Jaitley has said that the Centre supports the inclusion of petroleum products within GST’ ambit, but it can happen only if states come on board.

“As far as the Central government is concerned, we are in favour of bringing petroleum products under the GST, let me categorically put it. But we will wait for the consensus of the states. And, I do hope that at some stage – sooner than later – the states would agree to it,” Jaitley recently told the Rajya Sabha in reply to a question."
Indian Army's Yeti Claim Was Bad Data That Only Worsens Our Biodiversity Crisis,https://m.thewire.in/article/environment/indian-armys-yeti-claim-was-bad-data-that-only-worsens-our-biodiversity-crisis,"May 04, 2019  |  Dhruv Gangadharan Arvind","The crux of the problem is that if we don’t know what is out there or how widely species are distributed, how can we convince people about the reality and form of the biodiversity crisis? – Conservation Biogeography, 2011

The Indian Army’s announcement of “Mysterious Footprints of mythical beast ‘Yeti'” with photographic ‘evidence’ of footprints on Twitter doesn’t just appear as a farce to sceptics. With respect to our understanding of animals, it reveals how the “discovery” of such a cryptic species is communicated. It is also an example of how such misinformation has wider implications for biodiversity conservation.

With approximately 8.7 million species, our planet harbours a staggering diversity of life in its ecosystems. Conservationists, taxonomists and geographers systematically catalogue and map this biodiversity to find patterns and understand variations to develop conservation models.

A pioneering study in 2011 showed that of the 8.7 million species, only 1.2 million have been formally identified and catalogued, while 86% of biodiversity still awaits description. Despite the use of sophisticated tools and technology, this statistic shows how little we actually know about the diversity of life, especially at a time when up to a million species are at risk of extinction due to human influences.

As the global conservation movement becomes a data-driven effort, such gaps in our knowledge of biodiversity hinder conservation. They can mainly be attributed to unreliable or incomplete data together with a lack of robust methods of enquiry that end up producing uncertain information on the presence of species in an area.

Erroneous primary information

The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) popularised the concept of binomial nomenclature, which has been used to identify and catalogue species. Modern species inventories like the Encyclopaedia of Life, which provide access to species information and knowledge on biodiversity, have their origins in Linnaeus’s book Systema Naturae (1735). Regarding the 86% – the discrepancy between the actual number of species and the number of species described by scientists constitutes a Linnaean shortfall.

Yeti sightings can be understood in this context. As a creature of myth sustained through folklore in the Himalayan-Tibetan region, the ‘abominable snowman’ has fascinated many. Much to public dismay, an article on The Wire communicated the findings of a study published in 2017 that ascribed the identity of yetis to the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus), the Tibetan brown bear (Ursus arctos pruinosus) and the Himalayan black bear (Ursus thibetanus laniger).

This means yeti sightings were actually bear sightings. The myth was busted – but the conflict doesn’t appear to be resolved. This is because of the way doubts vis-à-vis ecological data have been allowed to persist.

While it is clear that yetis can’t be defined as a separate species, the three bears are biologically distinct. If one were to assimilate all yeti sightings ever recorded, which of the three bear (sub)species could the yeti be attributed to? This isn’t a superfluous problem that concerns only bear enthusiasts. The example shows how erroneous primary information such as yeti sightings can negatively affect our efforts to extract information specific to the three bears pertinent.

Addressing threats of endangerment, the IUCN Red List lists “awareness and communication” as conservation actions and calls for research on the bears’ “population size, distribution and trends”. This obviously doesn’t include bizarre operations conducted by the country’s armed forces to find an “elusive snowman”, setting irresponsible standards in scientific communication.

Keep the garbage out

A map from the 2017 bear study shows researchers had collected samples of a Tibetan brown bear from Makalu Barun, Nepal, and the army had located the supposed yeti footprints at the Makalu Base Camp. This reveals another problem: the veracity of primary data used in models to determine how species are geographically distributed and mapped.

If the use of pugmarks is an established method to locate species like tigers, why can’t the yeti’s footprints be used to indicate its presence? Should maps now show the occurrence of a yeti in a region populated by brown bears?

If the army personnel had properly examined these footprints and catalogued them, they would have served as valuable information to map the distribution of bears in the region, and would have counted as vital research in the IUCN’s book.

Experts have acknowledged that insufficient information on the geographical distribution of species can blow large holes in our conservation knowledge. This amounts to a Wallacean shortfall, named after British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913): an inadequacy of information on the geographic distribution of species.

The yeti case isn’t isolated. The North American bigfoot or sasquatch is a similarly misidentified cryptic species that has been reported in places populated by the American black bear (Ursus americanus). A study published in 2009 showed how similar the sasquatch’s and bear’s distributions seemed to be, although it didn’t attempt – thankfully – to check if the sasquatch really existed. It concluded that conservation models are only as good as the data they are built with. In other words, errors introduced in the process of publicly sourcing data could result in serious inaccuracies that impact actual conservation action.

Citizen science has allowed researchers to crowdsource conservation information, including sightings. For example, a database called iNaturalist allows people to record their observations at specific locations by uploading photographs, helping collect valuable information for the conservation community. And iNaturalist doesn’t return searches for ‘yeti’ and ‘sasquatch’.

It is pragmatic to filter wrong information out rather than discourage citizens from contributing data on biodiversity, but the army has set a substandard precedent. It was unbecoming for a national institution to communicate its findings in the manner it did because the data was essentially “bad” data. The encounter could instead have been used to communicate the presence of endangered bear species in the region to capture public imagination on conservation.

"SCO Is New but Indian, Pak Troops Are Old Partners in Multilateral Missions",https://m.thewire.in/article/security/india-pakistan-troops-sco-multilateral-missions,"Apr 30, 2018  |  Devirupa Mitra","New Delhi: While India and Pakistan will participate in a multilateral counter-terrorist military exercise in Russia later this year as part of their obligations as members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, soldiers from both countries have cooperated and worked together in third countries for over 60 years.

At the recent SCO meeting in China, Indian defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman confirmed that India will participate in the ‘Peace Mission’ military exercise to be held in the Ural mountains this September. A slew of breathless media reports followed, claiming this would be the “first time” troops from India and Pakistan – South Asia’s biggest rivals – would be taking part in an international military exercise.

While Sitharaman confirmed India’s presence at the exercise, it wasn’t a surprise. All SCO members take part together in counter-terrorist military exercises – a fact that was widely reported when India and Pakistan became full members of the grouping last year.

In fact, India and Pakistan have technically already been involved in a common multilateral military exercise. The annual Cobra Gold drill has seven full participating members, but India and Pakistan have been sending regular delegations as observers in the last few couple of years.

While the SCO’s military exercise will last only a few days, Indian and Pakistani soldiers have been working side by side in difficult and remote areas of the world in peacekeeping operations under the United Nations, where they are often deployed for months and years in risky and dangerous ‘real world’ situations..

A review of the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations’s database shows that India and Pakistan have at least 28 missions, past and present, in common between them. In total, over 55 UN missions have been completed since the first peacekeeping mission during the Suez crisis.

It is actually not much of a surprise that soldiers from the two South Asian nations have found themselves together over the years, since both India and Pakistan have consistently been among the top five troop contributors to UN missions.

Among the 14 current missions, India and Pakistan are working in conjunction in the UN organisation stabilization mission in DRC (MONUSCO), where they have presently deployed 2327 and 3429 soldiers, respectively. Both countries have paid a heavy toll during this mission, with a combined loss of 25 military personnel.

In fact, Congo has been the joint operational ground for Indian and Pakistani troops from the beginning. The earliest that the two countries were in the same UN mission was also in Congo for the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) from 1960 to 1964. At the peak of the mission, there were 19,828 troops in the Congo, who were supervising the withdrawal of Belgian forces and preventing civil war. There were soldiers from 30 countries, including India and Pakistan. Indian diplomat Rajeshwar Dayal had been the head of the mission for nine months.

In yet another peacekeeping mission in Congo about half a century later, two future army chiefs of India and Pakistan worked together to implement the 1999 Lusaka ceasefire agreement.

Pakistani army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa was one of the bridge commanders in 2007-8 who was reporting to Bikram Singh, who was the Indian army chief from 2012 to 2014. In an article in India Today, Singh narrated how he and Bajwa worked in sync over complex operational matters.

During the sixties, Indian army officer P.S. Gyani had been one of the force commanders of the 15-month long UN Yemen Observation Mission, which included military personnel from India and Pakistan who observed the execution of the disengagement agreement between Saudi Arabia and the then United Arab Republic.

More recently, Lt Gen Satish Nambiar was the first force commander of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in 1992-93, which was mandated to create the conditions for an eventual settlement of the Yugoslav civil war. India did not send troops for UNPROFOR, but Nambiar had over 3000 Pakistani soldiers under his supervision.

Around that time, the UN Observer mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) was established to ensure compliance of the ceasefire agreement between the Georgian government and the Abkhaz authorities. Three Pakistani military officers were chief military observers during its 16-year-long period. India had been among the 34 countries that sent troops to the central Asian country.

Pakistani diplomat Iqbal Riza had been head of two important UN missions – in Bosnia and Herzegovina and El Salvaldor – where Indian soldiers played an important role."
India Needs a Court of Appeal to Maintain the Supreme Court's Status,https://m.thewire.in/article/government/why-india-needs-a-court-of-appeal-to-maintain-the-supreme-courts-status,"Mar 07, 2016  |  Vishavjeet Chaudhary","A National Court of Appeal will help clear the backlog of cases and maintain the Supreme Court’s position as the apex court of the land.

The Supreme Court of India, as the highest court of the land, has a sacrosanct function to ensure that the country is governed adhering to the principles of the rule of law. It has evolved remarkably well, steering the country through thick and thin. It also has had a tremendous contribution to the jurisprudential landscape, not just in the country but also internationally. The time has come, however, to revisit the court’s function and align it with the needs of today.

A different time

Since the Supreme Court was established in 1950, the nation’s demands have changed tremendously. The population of India in 1950 was less than 36 crores. At present, it is over 1.2 billion. The questions that came before the courts back then were also of a comparatively rudimentary nature – as can be expected of a newly-conceived nation. There were, of course, important constitutional matters that the Court had to adjudicate on. However, areas of law like intellectual property, and taxation and corporate law were not as big as they are today. Thus, with a limited population and limited areas of law, the Court could cope with just the chief justice and seven judges. Working hours and days were also limited to four hours a day, 28 days a year.

Over the decades, with the growth in population and an increasing number of cases going for appeal, the current number of judges at the Supreme Court increased and now stands at 25 (with the maximum allowed being 31). The Court also functions for most of the year now. Even with the increase in the number of judges and working hours, there is a massive backlog of cases. In 2015, the previous chief justice of India, Justice H L Dattu, estimated the number of pending cases in the country at three crores. A majority of these cases were in the lower courts but there was also a substantial number of cases pending before the Supreme Court.

Perhaps looking at it from an external viewpoint will be a wake up call. A victim who was injured in the terror attacks in the Taj Hotel wanted the trial for compensation to take place in London rather than in India. In 2013, a London court ruled that the case could be fought in London courts, on the grounds that holding the trial in India could take “some twenty years.”

Why national courts of appeal are a good idea

Getting justice in India takes years, sometimes even decades. The Supreme Court cannot to be blamed for this. Delivering justice does take time – in order to ensure fairness, all parties should be satisfied that they have had reasonable time to prepare their cases, present witnesses and so on.

However, there is a solution that can at least unclog the Supreme Court so that cases that matter the most and have an impact on the country as a whole can be wrapped up with reasonable efficiency.

On February 26 the Supreme Court issued a notice to the central government to establish a national court of appeal with benches in Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai. This seems to be a step in the right direction for numerous reasons.

First, the Supreme Court will maintain its place as the apex court of land and – like England, Wales and the US – only rule on matters that are of constitutional importance or set new legal precedent. This will allow the Court to dedicate more time to develop the law. The Supreme Court of the UK, for instance, consists of 12 judges and in 2013-2014 only heard about 80 cases. For most cases, the final court of appeal is the aptly named Court of Appeal. Similarly, in India, if a court of appeal is established, the majority of appeals from high courts can be addressed in these courts.

Second, it will make geographical sense to have different benches to hear appeals. As of now, all appeals have to be heard in New Delhi, inconvenient for cases originating in other parts of the country.

Third, a court of appeal can work as an excellent mechanism to sieve cases. If there are areas of law that are particularly unsettled and need clarification, the court of appeal can club them together and send these forward to the Supreme Court. Not only can a number of individual cases be disposed of but areas of law can also be settled and a clear precedent set.

Finally, if the Supreme Court only deals with crucial cases, the process will become streamlined and will save a lot of time and expense, for both litigants and the courts.

There are practical obstacles, of course. For instance, how do we appoint judges to the court of appeal? How do we modify the procedure? Many such issues would have to be worked out. Without doubt, however, it is time to seriously consider a new court of appeal to unclog the Supreme Court and to ensure that its position as the apex court is preserved.

Coronavirus Outbreak in India: Six Suspected Cases Admitted to RML Hospital,https://m.thewire.in/article/health/coronavirus-outbreak-in-india-six-suspected-cases-admitted-to-rml-hospital,"Jan 31, 2020  |  PTI","New Delhi: Six persons, suspected of being affected by the novel coronavirus, have been kept under observation at an isolation ward of Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital here and their test reports are awaited, hospital sources said on Friday.

India reported its first case of novel coronavirus in Kerala on Thursday and the patient has been kept in an isolation ward in the state, the Union health ministry said.

Five persons self-reported to the RML hospital, designated to deal with such cases, with respiratory problems and fever, hospital sources said.

Among the five, a female (24) has been staying in China since 2015 and had returned to India on January 29.

Apart from the female patient, four men, one aged 45-years, returned to India on January 23 while another (35) has been staying in China for the last seven years and returned to India on January 28.

Another male (19) was in China from November 2019 to January 24, 2020, and returned to India on January 25. Another male (34) who was staying in China for the last 10 years, returned to India on January 16.

While the above five had self-admitted themselves on January 30, the remaining one is an old admission — a male (32), who visited China from January 4 to January 11, officials said.

“The samples of all the six patients have been sent for testing and their reports are awaited,” an RML official said.

The government has stepped up its efforts to detect and prevent the spread of the virus that has killed at least 170 people and infected more than 7,700 in China and has spread to at least 17 countries already.

Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba on Thursday reviewed the country’s preparedness with the concerned ministries – health and family welfare, external affairs, defence, home affairs, civil aviation, information and broadcasting, labour and employment, and shipping – to tackle the spread of the virus, an official release said.

He also spoke to chief secretaries of the states and UTs through video-conference, it added.

During these meetings, it was decided that all those who have come from China after 15 January will be tested for the exposure to the virus and also the lab facilities will be augmented.

While six labs will start functioning from Thursday, including one at AIIMS in Delhi, six more labs will start function by Friday, the release said.

The ministry has asked people to refrain from travelling to China and the states bordering Nepal – Uttarakhand, UP, Bihar, West Bengal and Sikkim – have stepped up vigil."
"India Holds ""Substantive"" Talks with China Over NSG Bid",https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/india-holds-substantive-talks-with-china-over-nsg-bid,"Sep 14, 2016  |  Reuters","New Delhi: India on Tuesday said it had held “substantive“ talks with China on its bid to become a fully fledged member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a club of nations that trades in civil nuclear technology.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is campaigning to join the NSG to back a multi-billion-dollar drive to build nuclear power plants in partnership with Russia, the US and France and reduce India‘s reliance on polluting fossil fuels.

Yet his bid to win accession to the 48-member group, founded in response to India‘s first atomic weapons test in 1974, has so far failed to win over strategic rival China, which enjoys a de facto veto because the group operates by consensus.

India‘s foreign ministry said in a statement that its chief nuclear negotiator, Amandeep Singh Gill, had hosted a Chinese delegation led by Director General Wang Qun of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The talks, agreed earlier by the two countries’ foreign ministers, covered issues of mutual interest in the areas of disarmament and non-proliferation and focused on India‘s bid to join the NSG.

“The discussions were candid, pragmatic and substantive,” the foreign ministry said, adding that further talks would be held.

China‘s foreign ministry, in its statement on the talks, said the issue of countries which are not signatories to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty joining the NSG was a “new issue” for the group.

China is willing to hold talks on the issue, but does not yet have a position on the joining of the group by any specific country that has not signed the treaty, the ministry added.

The treaty recognises the five permanent members of the UN Security Council – the US, Russia, China, Britain and France – as nuclear weapons powers but not others.

India has ruled out signing the NPT but says its track record of non-proliferation should entitle it to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group. India was granted an NSG waiver in 2008 that allows it to engage in nuclear commerce, but deprives it of a vote in the organisation’s decision making.

Backers of India‘s NSG bid, which include the US, hope a deal can still be reached despite a setback at the group’s annual meeting in Seoul in June.

Modi will host Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit of the BRICS emerging markets caucus in the Indian resort state of Goa in mid-October."
India’s NSG Dream Is Becoming a Distant Mirage,https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/indias-nsg-dream-is-becoming-a-distant-mirage,"Nov 30, 2016  |  The Wire Staff","However, the Wassenaar Arrangement may soon be ready to welcome India into its fold, officials indicated.

New Delhi: India’s initial optimism on being able enter the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) soon has withered away, with the last consultative group meeting in Vienna not making much progress, in New Delhi’s perception.

At the consultative group meeting in Vienna on November 12, Argentina’s ambassador to Austria Rafael Mariano Grossi presented the preliminary findings of his consultations with members of the NSG to find an acceptable solution to India’s application.

In Seoul, Grossi, the outgoing NSG chair, was made the facilitator to find a way out of the stalemate in which China and several other nations wanted to draw up special entry ‘criteria’ for applicants who are not a part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. For Beijing, the insistence of helped to not just to stall India’s membership, but to also put Pakistan’s application in the same bracket.

India was, obviously, not part of the deliberations in Vienna. But the proceedings have not brought good cheer.

According to sources, Grossi’s presentation had a “lot of resonance” among the officials present at the meeting, with some members asking for further clarifications.

There was no official statement after the meeting. China, once again, was the exception. Chinese officials have been proactively releasing statements since India expressed interest in joining the NSG. Three days after the Vienna meeting, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson described the Vienna meeting as a “good start of the inter-governmental process to implement the two-step proposal”. With the new incoming US administration, there is more concern on whether President-elect Donald Trump will have any leverage to work with Beijing to convince it to modify its views, just as George Bush had mustered all of US’s diplomatic muscle to get India an NSG waiver in 2008.

Indian officials have been careful not to use the Chinese phrase of ‘two-step’ proposal and thereby give it currency. But there is increasing acceptance within the group for a “non-discriminatory” process, which will draw up the qualifications for membership before the applications are considered.

A week before the meeting, Grossi’s remarks at a conference in Brussels were revealing about the consultations moving towards a criteria-based approach.

“What I can say, and this has to do maybe with other comments, is that what we are looking for is something which is of general application. We are not working on the basis of Country A or Country B or Country C. We are working on something that, if successful, it is a big if because it is a big issue and the problems are big. If successful, this is not something which is going to be for the benefit of Country A or for the benefit of Country B or for the benefit of Country C. It is, if I may put it like this, an attempt to address the challenge or the question put to the group by the existence of three non-NPT countries which actively aspire to become members of the NSG. This is as much as I think I could say. “

As The Wire reported before the consultative group meeting, Austria was one of the few countries which remained steadfast on the need for the NPT to be the cornerstone of qualifications for new NSG members.

On Monday, an Austrian foreign ministry delegation held formal talks with Ministry of Eexternal Affairs secretary (west) Sujata Mehta in Delhi, where the NSG matter was raised by India. There was no change in its position, with Austrian officials only willing to say that they will play a “constructive” role.

Austria, which considers nuclear non-proliferation as an important principle of its foreign policy, was one of the leaders of the resolution to lead up to a legally-binding instrument to ban nuclear weapons. The resolution passed through the UN first committee with flying colours on October 27, but will have to now confirmed by the UN general assembly in December.

There was division among the nuclear weapon states in their voting pattern – India, Pakistan and China abstained, while the UK, Israel, the US, France and Russia voted against the resolution and only North Korea voted in favour.

Officially, India has still not yet decided whether to take part in the 2017 conference to draft the new convention.

A senior Austrian official told The Wire that there was no connection between India joining the conference and its NSG’s membership application. “These are not related,” he said. However, he indicated that India’s membership will take place before the new nuclear weapon prohibition treaty would be in place – which is a rather open-ended calendar.

However, while the NSG dream seems to be slipping away for now, India may soon become a member of the the second export control regime after joining the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The 2010 Indo-US joint statement had identified four export control regimes – the NSG, MTCR, the Australia Group and the Wassenaar Arrangement – whose portals would be knocked for India’s entry.

After MTCR, the Wassenaar Arrangement, which aims to regulate the spread of strategic and dual-use technologies, may soon be welcoming New Delhi, officials indicated. Unlike some other regimes, Wassenaar has specific criteria for entrants, which includes whether the country has adhered to guidelines of the NSG and the NPT. The operative word here is adherence, which means countries do not necessarily need to be signatories."
Modi Government's Defence of High Fuel Prices Is Flimsy,https://m.thewire.in/article/business/petrol-price-narendra-modi-government,"Sep 14, 2017  |  Prasenjit Bose","While international prices have fallen sharply from an annual average of $105 per barrel in 2013-14 to $46 per barrel in 2015-16 and 2016-17, the Centre has hiked excise duties on petrol and diesel over nine times.

The retail prices of diesel and petrol in September 2017 have either surpassed or nearly touched the levels prevailing in June 2014, when the Narendra Modi government had just been sworn into office.

The table below shows that while the retail price of diesel was Rs 57.28 per litre in Delhi on June 2, 2014 – when the international oil price was $106.88 per barrel – it has now reached a very similar price of Rs 58.72 per litre even though international oil prices are at $53.06 per barrel.

Table 1: Prices of Petrol and Diesel: International & Domestic

International crude oil price (Indian basket) Domestic retail price of petrol Domestic retail price of diesel $ per barrel Delhi Kolkata Mumbai Chennai Delhi Kolkata Mumbai Chennai 2-Jun-14 106.88 71.41 79.26 80 74.6 57.28 61.97 65.84 61.12 12-Sep-17 53.06 70.38 73.12 79.48 72.95 58.72 61.37 62.37 61.84 Source: PIB Press Releases Source: Indian Oil

When petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan says that the government does not intend to intervene in petro-product pricing – which is supposedly being determined by oil companies on a daily basis after price deregulation – he is being disingenuous.

This is because the excise duty on diesel currently stands at Rs 17.33 per litre and that on petrol at Rs 21.48 per litre. State-level taxes on petro-products vary across states. In Delhi, the VAT currently stands at Rs 8.68 per litre on diesel and Rs 14.96 per litre on petrol, which is significantly lower than the central excise duties.

With international crude oil prices falling sharply from the annual average of $105 per barrel in 2013-14 to $46 per barrel in 2015-16 and 2016-17, the Modi government has hiked excise duties on petrol and diesel over nine times in order to encash a windfall. Rather than passing on the benefits of low oil prices to the consumers, the Centre has utilised the petroleum sector for additional revenue mobilisation, which can be seen from Table 2 below.

Table 2: Taxes & Duties from the Petroleum Sector

In Rs. Crore 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 Central Taxes/Duties on Crude Oil & Petroleum Products 100339 106090 126219 209536 273502 of which, Excise Duty 73310 77982 99184 178591 242691 State Taxes/Duties on Crude Oil & Petroleum Products 136021 152442 160526 160114 188435 of which, Sales Tax/VAT 115036 129045 137157 142848 166378 % of GDP 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 Tax/Duties on Crude Oil & Petroleum Products 1.0 0.9 1.0 1.5 1.8 of which, Excise Duty 0.7 0.7 0.8 1.3 1.6 State Taxes/Duties on Crude Oil & Petroleum Products 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.2 of which, Sales Tax/VAT 1.2 1.1 1.1 1.0 1.1 Source: Ready Reckoner, June 2017, PPAC, MoP&NG, GoI

Excise duties annually raised from the petroleum sector increased from Rs 77,982 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 2,42,691 crore in 2016-17. Annual revenues from excise duties grew at 27% in 2014-15, 80% in 2015-16 and 36% in 2016-17, rising from 0.7% of GDP in 2013-14 to 1.6% of GDP in 2016-17. This substantial additional revenue mobilisation has enabled the Centre to balance its budget without making much effort to raise direct taxes.

It is also noteworthy that the state governments (taken together) have not followed this route and therefore the state-level annual sales tax/VAT revenues on petro-products have remained at 1.1% of GDP from 2013-14 to 2016-17. Revenue mobilisation from states’ sales tax/VAT increased by only by Rs 37,333 crore from 2013-14 to 2016-17, i.e. around 30% in three years, while the nominal increase in central excise revenues was to the tune of 257% during the same period. Thus it is the central government, and not the state governments, which has been milking the petroleum sector.

When international crude oil prices are showing an upward trend in recent times, the central government must bring down the excise duties rather than allowing the oil companies to raise the retail prices at will. Imposing high taxes on petro-products, which are necessities and hence display low price-elasticity of demand, is a soft option as far as revenue mobilisation is concerned.

At a time when GST has been introduced to rationalise indirect taxes (the extent to which that has been achieved is questionable though), it is indeed hypocritical to keep petro-products outside the GST ambit in order to raise additional central revenues. Rather than running after the chimera of a fiscal windfall through meaningless steps like demonetisation, the government should focus on ways and means to increase direct tax revenues from the more affluent sections of society.

Debate: Regret India's Decision to Ban Pak Scholars But Fostering Intellectual Exchange Important,https://m.thewire.in/article/south-asia/fostering-intellectual-exchange-often-best-means-of-support-association-for-asian-studies,"Jun 14, 2018  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: In response to calls that the Association for Asian Studies (AAS) should cancel their conference next month due to India’s ban on Pakistani scholars from attending it, and questions over whether the experiment to hold AAS-in-Asia conferences should be terminated, the officers of AAS have asked whether scholars should refuse to participate in international conferences held in any country with problematic government policies. “This would include the U.S., which has a blanket ban on potential participants from seven countries,” the officers said in a statement.

The Indian government had come under attack from all quarters when it recently came to light that it had explicitly directed the co-organisers of the July 5-8 AAS-in-Asia conference in New Delhi – AAS and Ashoka University – to not include any scholars from Pakistan.

In a previous statement to The Wire, the organisers had said that they “deeply regret” the decision of the Indian government as it was “not in tune with open exchange of ideas and knowledge”, but added that directive came too late in the day with preparations already underway for years.

The officers of AAS have in their latest statement – signed by its president, vice president and two former presidents – said that while the AAS board had before signing an memorandum of understanding with Ashoka University “raised the question of the difficulty of obtaining visas for individual scholars to travel to India,” they did not, however, “anticipate a blanket refusal to issue visas to all scholars from a given country. Nor did we know that the Indian government would also include in this prohibition people of Pakistani origin who hold other passports.”

They have further added: “The current officers of the Association are in agreement with those among our members who urge us to oppose restrictions on scholarly exchange across borders and to challenge such restrictions wherever possible. At the same time, we recognize the complex political climates in which many of our colleagues function. We believe that fostering intellectual exchange is often the best means of support, even though in many instances this will involve compromises rather than stances of absolute moral purity.”

Full text of their statement is reproduced below.

§

A controversy is developing among the AAS membership with regard to the AAS-in-Asia conference in Delhi, following the decision of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of the Government of India to deny visas to all Pakistani scholars. The AAS-in-Asia conferences began as an experiment four years ago. Two questions now face our membership: 1) Should the experiment to hold AAS-in-Asia conferences be terminated? and 2) How should AAS handle the current situation?

With regard to the first question, AAS members need to consider two sets of difficulties that arise in holding AAS conferences in Asia. The first is finding host institutions that are willing to provide the faculty, administrative staffing, and funding involved in organizing a conference that is now being attended by some 1,000 scholars. This is a challenge everywhere: even the smaller regional conferences affiliated with AAS stateside are finding it difficult in this age of budget cutbacks to find campuses willing to serve as host institutions. Securing a partner for a much larger event involves extended discussion of logistics, responsibilities, and finances.

The second major set of problems is political. With the possible exception of one or two countries in Asia, it is difficult to find a politically uncomplicated country to serve as a conference venue, so that issues of visas and academic freedom do not arise. As we know, the problem is no less acute in the U.S., where the latest iteration of the federal government’s travel ban puts restrictions on visitors from five predominantly Muslim countries and adds limits on certain travelers from two non-Muslim countries.

With regard to the second set of problems, AAS is coming under attack for two reasons: 1) for its decision to proceed with the conference being co-hosted by Ashoka University and 2) for the AAS’s failure to inform its members as soon as it learned of the Indian government’s decision not to grant visas to any scholars from Pakistan.

AAS and Ashoka University have been working on this conference since 2014. The AAS board felt that it was important to rotate the conference across the four regions into which AAS is divided, to counter the apparent East Asia bias in the previous conferences, which were held in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. Despite the many dynamic educational institutions and exciting scholarly research being carried out in South Asia, few scholars from that large region had been participating in the AAS-in-Asia conferences. When faculty and administrators at Ashoka University said they were willing to take on this responsibility, AAS was delighted. The board felt that Ashoka’s offer was an exciting opportunity to deepen scholarly exchanges across Asia, and we agreed to use a multi-tiered fee structure that made participation less expensive for scholars from South Asian (and some other) countries.

The AAS board did discuss issues of academic freedom prior to signing a memorandum of understanding with Ashoka University. Ashoka was firm in its commitment to the selection of panels on the basis of academic merit and breadth of participation across institutions and countries. These principles were honored in the selection of panels. We also raised the question of the difficulty of obtaining visas for individual scholars to travel to India; we did not, however, anticipate a blanket refusal to issue visas to all scholars from a given country. Nor did we know that the Indian government would also include in this prohibition people of Pakistani origin who hold other passports.

As soon as we learned of the MEA’s decision in early March of this year, back-channel efforts were begun to have the MEA’s blanket ruling reversed. In the third week of March, the Pakistani scholars whose panels had been selected for presentation at the conference (a total of eight people) were informed about the MEA ruling. They were offered the option of presenting their papers via Skype, as a way of ensuring our commitment to academic freedom and salvaging their valuable contributions as far as possible despite the MEA’s ruling. The MEA letter was posted on the conference website on March 6, and the subsequent letter from the Home Ministry, which arrived on April 6, was posted on April 9.

Scholars are now signing a petition not only denouncing the Indian government but also criticizing the way AAS has handled the situation and calling for us to cancel the conference. We acknowledge and understand those who question how AAS has handled the situation, and we respect their views as to how we should deal with it now. For those aware of the history between India and Pakistan, the fact that the MEA has denied visas to Pakistani scholars is, however reprehensible, not unexpected, given the tensions, border skirmishes, and three full wars between the two countries over the past seventy years. Knowing that there was even a possibility that the Indian government would deny visas, should AAS never have agreed to work with an Indian university to hold AAS-in-Asia in India? Further, knowing that there are political complications involved in virtually every country in Asia, should the AAS-in-Asia experiment be terminated?

While there are financial costs in canceling a conference for which reservations were made over a year in advance, there is a broader question to be addressed: Is there merit in working with Asian institutions in the hope of helping to strengthen academic freedoms and civil society, recognizing the contexts of current limitations? We might also go further to ask if scholars should refuse to participate in international conferences held in any country with problematic government policies. This would include the U.S., which has a blanket ban on potential participants from seven countries.

The current officers of the Association are in agreement with those among our members who urge us to oppose restrictions on scholarly exchange across borders and to challenge such restrictions wherever possible. At the same time, we recognize the complex political climates in which many of our colleagues function. We believe that fostering intellectual exchange is often the best means of support, even though in many instances this will involve compromises rather than stances of absolute moral purity.

"Kartarpur Corridor: Impasse Broken, Pakistani Delegation to Visit India on March 13",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/kartarpur-corridor-impasse-broken-pakistani-delegation-to-visit-india-on-march-13,"Feb 08, 2019  |  The Wire Staff","New Delhi: India accepted Pakistan’s proposal to travel for a meeting in New Delhi on the Kartarpur corridor issue, breaking the impasse of the last two weeks over scheduling the first bilateral discussion on the modalities to launch the cross-border pilgrimage.

Pakistan’s foreign office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal tweeted on February 7 that Islamabad had proposed that a Pakistani delegation travel to India on March 13, followed by a reciprocal visit by the Indian delegation on March 28.

In a spirit of constructive engagement #Pakistan has proposed to India that the Pakistan delegation may visit #India on 13 March followed by the return visit of the Indian delegation to Pakistan on 28 March to finalise the draft agreement for the #kartarpur corridor (1/2) — Dr Mohammad Faisal (@ForeignOfficePk) February 7, 2019

In less than an hour, India’s external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said that the Pakistani delegation was welcome to visit to India on March 13. “Follow up meeting can be held in Pakistan, as required,” he said.

We welcome the visit of #Pakistan team to discuss and finalise modalities for facilitating visit of pilgrims through #Kartarpur Sahib Corridor on 13 March 2019 to India. Follow up meeting can be held in Pakistan, as required. 1/2 — Raveesh Kumar (@MEAIndia) February 7, 2019

India has also asked Pakistan to hold “technical level discussions between engineers on both sides without waiting for discussion on the modalities”.

“We hope Pakistan would positively respond & confirm coordinates of crossing point as well,” he said.

India and Pakistan had last year agreed to start work on the Kartarpur corridor which would link two holy sites of the founder of Sikhism. This is the flagship project which will be launched on the occasion of 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak this year.

On January 21, Pakistan had asked India to urgently send a team to discuss the modalities and finalise the agreement. A day later, India publicly offered two set of dates for a Pakistani delegation to travel across the border. Pakistan responded by describing it as a “typical example of the childish behaviour of this Indian Government”."
TRAI Rules: Do Indian TV Viewers Have Greater Choice Now?,https://m.thewire.in/article/business/trai-rules-do-indian-tv-viewers-now-actually-have-greater-choice,"Mar 01, 2019  |  Shivangi Mittal","For a country that often falls victim to poorly designed economic policies, India seems to be learning few lessons. Economic policies may be well-intentioned, but implementation problems persist owing to deficient policy detailing.

While ineffective social policies and programmes can be blamed on political myopia and opportunism, there is little excuse for oversight by regulators endowed with technical expertise.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) new framework for the broadcasting sector demonstrates how the regulator could have paid greater attention to market realities in order to achieve its objective of providing greater consumer choice.

Ensuring that markets and businesses operate in a manner that is socially desirable requires that regulators provide them with adequate incentives to do so, especially in the absence of efficient enforcement mechanisms. Grievances related to the new regulatory framework for the television industry underscore the importance of incorporating appropriate incentives in regulatory design.

The telecom regulator’s latest regulation seeks to engender transparency and non-discrimination in the television supply chain, while promoting consumer choice and growth of the sector. It includes new rules for retail and wholesale pricing and outlines the terms of agreements signed between broadcasters and distributors (DTH, Cable TV operators, etc.).

Additionally, the regulation has implications for the pricing and bundling of TV channels, giving consumers greater freedom to customise their subscriptions. Despite prescribing a detailed overhaul of the television supply chain, the new framework fails to provide distributors with the necessary incentive to enhance consumer choice, thereby defeating one of its key objectives.

According to the new regulation, consumers are required to pay a fixed monthly fee to their service provider (distributor). This fee, known as ‘network capacity fee’, is intended to compensate distributors for their investments in network infrastructure, and is capped at Rs 130 for the first 100 channels.

While this is the prescribed upper limit, a report by CRISIL indicates that most service providers are charging consumers at the capped fee.

The 100 channels – known as the ‘Basic Service Tier’ – include channels which are mandatory to broadcast, such as Doordarshan, and other free-to-air channels. While retaining discretion in bundling these 100 channels, distributors are supposed to be mindful of customer preferences. However, there is little incentive for distributors to actually do so.

Irrespective of whether they engender a match between demand and supply of the 100 channels in the basic service tier, distributors receive the network capacity fee (NCF) every month. It is thus most profitable for them to include those channels in the pack for which they can negotiate lucrative deals with broadcasters, instead of including the channels that interest consumers.

For instance, distributors who are part of the same group of companies as a broadcaster might include channels of only those broadcasters in the basic service tier.

Consumers can replace channels in the basic service tier with channels of their choice. However, very few consumers seem to be aware of this, and many find it cumbersome to substitute these channels. According to statistics released by TRAI, only about 50% of the TV households in India have migrated to the new regime. Consumers who are not discerning enough to exercise their choice in the total number of TV channels that they subscribe to are unlikely to do so for the basic service tier as well.

Further, it is unlikely that greater consumer choice will be enforced through competitive forces. It is costly for consumers to switch service providers, since this likely entails having to purchase new equipment, besides having to choose subscription packs again. They may also have to forego payments that they have made in advance to their previous operator. That a considerable number of consumers will switch to a different service provider is thus not a credible threat to induce a distributor to change the composition of the basic service tier that it offers.

It would also be impractical to expect TRAI to monitor consumer preferences and penalise distributors who do not provide channels which match consumer preferences. Thus, incentivising distributors to take cognisance of consumer tastes while selecting channels for the basic service tier is the only way that TRAI can truly enable consumer choice.

The NCF serves as an appropriate remedy for the lack of transparency in the dealings between broadcasters and distributors in the previous regime, but disincentiveses the distributor from appropriately provisioning for greater consumer choice.

As distributors now get a monthly fee to cover costs, they no longer have to resort to illicit practices such as under-reporting the number of subscribers to broadcasters, or charging consumers for watching free-to-air channels. However, it does not address the problem of distributors including channels that consumers do not wish to watch as part of the basic service tier. The fee has thus introduced an imbalance among the various objectives of this regulatory framework. In its current form, the regulation inadvertently prioritises the objective of ensuring transparency over that of providing greater consumer choice.

Such an imbalance changes the distribution of value among businesses and consumers, without ensuring that benefits accrue proportionately. Implementing the new framework has caused a considerable amount of confusion and controversy in the 183 million television-subscriber households across the country, and most reports indicate that TV bills have gone up for those who have migrated to the new regime. Despite this, the choice which TRAI sought to provide will not be available to consumers. Once again, an otherwise meticulously designed piece of regulation will prove to be insufficient because it fails to accommodate the correct balance of stakeholder incentives.

"Let's Not Demonise Britain Over the ICJ, India Wants to Be Elite Too",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-icj-uk-nationalism-bhandari,"Nov 24, 2017  |  Tunku Varadarajan","Nationalist chest-thumping is for lightweights and losers. India is neither.

There has been unbridled exultation in India after the election of Dalveer Bhandari to the International Court of Justice. Ravi Shankar Prasad, the country’s law minister, was moved to Tweet “Bharat Mata ki Jai!”

India’s rise in ease of doing business, upgrading of ratings by Moody’s followed by election of Justice #DalveerBhandari at #ICJ where hundreds of countries supported India only reinforces the resurgent India under @narendramodi. Bharat Mata Ki Jai! — Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad) November 21, 2017

The normally circumspect Sushma Swaraj, India’s foreign minister, trumped that tweet with a jubilant “Vande Mataram” and “Jai Hind”.

The tone and din in the media – among those reporting and commenting on the victory of saadda Dalveer over the perfidious Britishers – was akin to that found in cricket stadiums when India plays a one-day international: Jeetega bhai jeetega, India jeetega! It all seemed like a replay at the United Nations of Mohun Bagan’s cathartic victory in 1911 over the East Yorkshire Regiment. Or to put it in more demotic terms, it was like Lagaan. Plucky little Indians take on snooty, arrogant Brits and get the better of them with a mixture of native wit and karmic justice.

This is unseemly, and also a strategic mistake. India approached the run-off vote between Justice Bhandari and Christopher Greenwood as if it were a David-and-Goliath affair. It positioned itself as the virtuous Outsider, fighting for the rights of ordinary nations against the might of the P5, the five permanent members of the United Nations. But India isn’t David. And it isn’t an ordinary nation, except in its own self-effacing rhetoric.

The idea of the P5 can be jarring. This veto-wielding elite enjoys privileges galore under the UN Charter, as well as a host of customary advantages by virtue of its Security Council status. One of those advantages was an asserted right to a seat on the ICJ. As a result, the United Kingdom has had a judge in the world court ever since 1946 – until this week.

This hasn’t been a bad thing. Britain is the intellectual home of much of modern public international law. The best judges on the ICJ have invariably been British. Remarkably, the finest public international lawyer never to have made it to the ICJ was also British – the late Ian Brownlie of Oxford University. (It was always whispered that his communist leanings as a young man kept him off the bench.) Justice Greenwood is a superb international lawyer, and there can be no argument that he is streets ahead of Justice Bhandari in intellect and ability. (Don’t be misled by all the criticism of Greenwood’s advice to Tony Blair on the Iraq War. His counsel was impeccable, given the evidence – now known to be dodgy – presented to him.)

But, to put it bluntly, the ICJ is a political body masquerading as a legal one. It is a constructive masquerade, of course, for a veneer of legality in international relations is better than no veneer (or no law) at all. So, while the departure of Justice Greenwood will diminish the overall quality of the court’s legal reasoning, it’s important to remember that only some of its cases are purely legal. Even in highly technical matters such as the delimitation of a continental shelf shared by two states, equitable considerations play as much a part as legal principles.

My point, however, isn’t to focus on the quality of the ICJ’s jurisprudence, or on the impact on that jurisprudence of Justice Bhandari’s re-election. It is to say that India needs, very quickly, to dial back the “neocolonial grievance” narrative that accompanied its bid for Bhandari. India is aggrieved by its exclusion from permanent membership of the Security Council. It has every right to be. The absence of the world’s biggest democracy is a travesty, one that will be compounded – if the UN Charter isn’t amended by then – when India overtakes China as the world’s most populous nation.

Yet India needs to be very careful, and scrupulously self-interested, in the manner in which it approaches this question. It wants the gates of permanent membership to be unlocked to let India in, not thrown so wide open that permanent membership becomes a meaningless thing. India should aspire to a form of permanent membership that resembles the current arrangement as closely as possible. It wants to be able to share in a global elite status, not be an instrument for an erosion of that status. It will ideally want a veto. And yes, like Britain, it will want an expectation that its candidate be a judge on the ICJ.

So, having played the “poor-Third-World-anticolonial” card for Justice Bhandari, it needs quickly to tear that card to shreds. India’s interests lie, now, in always asserting its strength, its exceptionalism, its heft and its status as one of the world’s indispensable nations. If India wants permanent membership of the Security Council, it has to start thinking like an elite country. And that means no ululation when its judges get elected to the ICJ, and no “Bharat mata ki jai” from its cabinet ministers on Twitter. Nationalist chest-thumping is for lightweights and losers. India is neither.

'Wide Angle' Episode 3: The Curious History of India-Pakistan Relations

Editorial: India and Pakistan Should De-Escalate Now,https://m.thewire.in/article/security/editorial-india-and-pakistan-should-de-escalate-now,"Mar 01, 2019  |  Editorial","India’s “non-military” military action against a Jaish-e-Muhammad establishment in Balakot, Pakistan and Pakistan’s retaliatory “non-relatiation” by dropping bombs on locations in Rajouri have brought the two countries to a crossroads. On one side lies the uncertain and hazardous road to a destination neither side would like to reach. And on the other, the possibility of de-escalation. It is essential that both India and Pakistan choose that option.

The fact that both India and Pakistan have lost a fighter jet each and that an Indian pilot is in Pakistani custody underlines the unpredictable nature of armed conflict. The pilot is likely to be released shortly and handed back to the Indian side. His return provides the perfect optic for the Indian side to scale back its rhetoric and find diplomatic means of building upon whatever it believes it has accomplished on the counter-terrorism front in the past three days.

Kinetic operations may yield benefits at the tactical level in the fight against terrorism but it is foolish to think the problem of terrorism can be defeated by military means alone. Since independence, India has fought four wars with Pakistan but the country’s political and military leadership always had clear and finite aims – even for the wars it did not initiate. At Kargil, for example, the goal was to evict Pakistani intruders from areas that were on the Indian side of the Line of Control and ensure the sanctity of the line.

Ending terrorism is a valid objective of Indian policy but only jingoist anchors and retired military hotheads on television believe this can be done by going up the escalatory ladder whose first rung was the airstrike on Balakot. The Narendra Modi government, which has both stoked the flames of hypernationalism and tried to use it for political benefit, must not allow irresponsible rhetoric to get the better of its political judgment. The official line is that ‘talks and terror’ cannot co-exist. The problem with this formulation is that the opposite does not hold: ‘no talks’ and terror very much exist together, as we have seen over the past few years. And as the problem persists, there is always the inherent danger that politicians will begin to believe war is the only way to end the problem of terror. While there is ample evidence from around the world about the limits and dangers of using mainly or exclusively military means against terrorism, the risk on the India-Pakistan front is apparent.

Roping in Foreign Academics to Prepare Course Content for Indian Universities Makes No Sense,https://m.thewire.in/article/education/roping-in-foreign-academics-to-prepare-course-content-for-indian-universities-makes-no-sense,"Jun 12, 2016  |  Pushkar","Why does the government not utilise the services of academics returning to India after studying or working abroad for designing and internationalising the courses?

It was recently revealed that the human resource development (HRD) ministry has roped in experts from leading global universities, including the University of Edinburgh, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge University and the University of Pennsylvania, to help design and internationalise the syllabuses at higher education institutions in the country.

There is nothing unusual in seeking assistance from experts and/or academic institutions abroad for higher education. However, one does have to consider if such assistance, whether paid for or not, is needed in the first place. In many cases, a big deal is made of foreign assistance when it is actually for the most trivial of reasons and serves no particular objective. The larger issue is whether international assistance can play a role in improving the quality of higher education and, if yes, what kind of help from abroad could make a difference for the better.

The truth is that roping in foreign academics to prepare the course content for our universities makes no sense at all. It is completely unnecessary.

Why foreign assistance?

Over the past decade or so, foreign assistance, broadly defined, has acquired growing relevance for India’s higher education. Part of the reason seems to lie in the failure of our universities to break into the ranks of the top 100-200 institutions in the world and, more generally, the persistence of mediocrity across the higher education sector. There seems to be an implicit acknowledgement, on the part of the government as well, that Western assistance, or at least some kind of borrowing or inspiration from Western models, will help improve the overall quality of higher education and perhaps even propel our best institutions into high world rankings.

It is useful to recall that international assistance of various kinds played a key and direct role in developing some of the first IITs, notably those at Mumbai and Kanpur. IIT-Bombay in fact received direct assistance from the USSR in the form of Russian roubles via UNESCO. More recently, US assistance has been sought for the newer IITs. In fact, foreign help is also being sought for other kinds of higher education institutions, in a variety of ways. Unlike the 1950s and the 1960s, however, when this sort of assistance was absolutely critical for newly-independent, poor and technologically-backward India that was woefully short on trained scientists, engineers, etc., it is not always clear why such assistance is necessary in the 2010s.

Seeking help

In recent years, the Indian government has been seeking help from abroad in a variety of ways. For example, since at least the 2000s, the government has been contemplating opening up the higher education sector to foreign universities. The NITI Aayog recently proposed the same. While this initiative does not count as ‘foreign assistance’ as properly understood, the logic behind it is common: that the ‘foreign’ component will be beneficial to India. Foreign universities are not only expected to bring world-class education to India but also have a positive impact on the quality of education at other academic institutions.

Take another example. The Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) has been launched to bring some of the best known academics in the west to India for short periods, both to teach and to explore common areas for research with Indian academics. GIAN promises to connect recognised institutions, notably central universities, IITs and IIMs with the best scholars and institutions in the US. The government’s expectation is that, among other things, GIAN will be beneficial for the adoption of new methods of pedagogy, boosting research in cutting-edge technologies and building stronger academic networks between both countries.

The government has also encouraged, through financial assistance and other means, collaborations between our universities with those abroad so that our academics benefit from such interaction and begin to contribute more significantly to knowledge production. Again, while the term ‘assistance’ does not seem to apply in such collaborative endeavours, the fact is that we are expected to gain more from them.

Even before Narendra Modi came to power, the government had started to give serious consideration to implementing the American model of community colleges in order to improve the skills of hundreds of millions of young Indians. Continuing on the same path, earlier this April, the current government approved 157 colleges and universities for running community colleges.

Justifying the need for help

The examples given above do not exhaust the broad range of foreign assistance initiatives that the government has taken up or extended in the recent past. As noted earlier, it has been reported that we are seeking assistance from some leading universities to design and internationalise the syllabuses at our universities. According to HRD minister Smriti Irani:

The government of India has been in touch with some international faculty and academicians and institutions who shall through RUSA, a national higher education mission, help states internationalise their curriculum in order to benefit their students.

On the face of it, headlines such as ‘Cambridge, MIT experts to help design syllabuses of Indian institutions‘ appear to be a worthy initiative, marking a big step forward in improving the quality of higher education. It is not a secret that the course syllabuses at most of our academic institutions are dated and revisions are carried out rather infrequently. The thinking seems to be that if foreign experts revise and update course content, this will independently and perhaps even immediately benefit our students in very tangible ways.

The truth is that roping in foreign academics to prepare the course content for our universities makes no sense at all. It is completely unnecessary.

Over the decades, hundreds of thousands of Indian students have headed abroad to some of the best universities in the UK, US and elsewhere for undergraduate and post-graduate degrees. While many of them have not returned, and most have not taken up the academic profession, scores of them have returned. Many have been mentored by some of the biggest names in their respective disciplines. A good number of them have made or are making a name for themselves on their own. Such foreign-trained academics can be found all across the country at different kinds of academic institutions, including research centres and think tanks.

One wonders why there is so little mention of brain-gain, even if it is quite small in comparison to the brain-drain that is taking place, and why the government does not utilise the services of these academics for designing and internationalising courses. Is it because government officials believe, as many others do, that those who have returned have done so because they are not good enough? Surely, at least some of those who have returned are competent enough to draft course outlines and such! But it is also the case that newspaper headlines on MIT or Oxford faculty lending a hand in updating course syllabuses sounds cooler than quietly seeking the help of India-based MIT-, Oxford- or CalTech-trained academics.

The other bothersome thing about using the services of MIT or Stanford academics for preparing course content for our universities is that in most cases, the syllabuses used by these experts is often easily available online and, when not, can be obtained quite conveniently. Surely, India-trained academics are at least capable enough to download and adapt the syllabuses at Harvard or Oxford for our universities.

The most damning case against seeking the help of foreign experts in this matter is that updating the syllabuses will have zero impact on the quality of education. Think about it. In the end, we need qualified faculty to teach the subject matter and we do not seem to have sufficient numbers of suitably-qualified faculty – even for the IITs and central universities. Perhaps more than other issues, the problem of faculty shortages and/or the reluctance of our academic institutions to hire qualified people needs to be addressed first. Indeed, there are scores of examples where qualified faculty are chased away from their respective universities or research centres because they are competent and do their job well.

Selective foreign assistance

At the same time, there is no doubt that we need foreign assistance, especially to improve the quality of higher education. However, in many cases, we seem to be seeking assistance in a way that is not needed. We are also underutilising our existing human resources, including scores of people who have studied abroad at some of the best institutions in the world. Yes, initiatives like GIAN will be beneficial for our higher education in the long run but why should we not be making better use of already-available human resources?

Seeking foreign assistance as keenly as we are doing, at least on paper, is also a denial of the real problems in higher education which are homegrown and will not be resolved in the least through foreign assistance of any kind. Initiatives such as using foreign experts to upgrade course content are purely cosmetic and will not do much to improve the quality of education. Instead, the government should really be pushing universities to hire qualified faculty and retain them. The government must also upgrade the infrastructure at those institutions which are capable and interested in increasing their faculty strength. Until that time, whatever help we get from abroad will have at best a limited impact on higher education.

Babul Supriyo at Jadavpur University: Imagining Universities as Temples,https://m.thewire.in/article/education/babul-supriyo-at-jadavpur-university-imagining-universities-as-temples,"Sep 23, 2019  |  Debaditya Bhattacharya","The fracas occasioned by the visit of singer-turned-BJP-parliamentarian Babul Supriyo on the campus of Jadavpur University has left behind a precious moral fable.

Despite clear indications to the contrary for years now, the fig leaf of institutional autonomy was still a part of legislative lore – with which we covered up the shameful exposure of our universities to the political establishment. Supriyo stripped the myth down to its real obscenity, in his short snatches of conversation with the vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University.

Even while the mayhem was raging on, and university property vandalised, videos surfaced on social media of the Union minister angrily chiding the VC about having orchestrated the protests against him. A visibly perturbed Suranjan Das, a well-known academic in his own right, was questioned about why he did not come to “receive” the minister on his visit. Just as Das was seen explaining to Supriyo that the event in question was organised by a student political outfit (ABVP), to which he himself was not invited, the BJP leader’s aggression peaked into a convulsive tirade: “I am sure you are a leftist!”

Whether or not Das is a leftist is a redundant debate. What is significant is Supriyo’s accusation – that to be a leftist is to be a criminal, a violator of “law and order”.

From a government that packs its jails with human rights activists and calls them “urban Naxals”, names “a red-coloured book” found at G.N. Saibaba’s residence as incriminating evidence, unleashes its police contingent to raid houses of university teachers for ‘leftist’ books, and stocks university administrations with stooges who demand CVs from arguably the best living historian of the country, this should not be unexpected. But as a society, we must be deeply worried if ‘leftist’ beliefs in themselves are regarded as a transgression of the law.

That one statement by a Union minister, within a university campus, spells doom for the Indian constitution and its inaugural pledge to a secular socialist imagination.

To return to the immediate context of the verbal assault on Das, it might be useful to alert the minister to how universities are instituted through Acts of parliament as structurally ‘autonomous’ bodies. Section 9(1)(b)(ii) of the Jadavpur University Act strives for this autonomy by maintaining that “a person shall not be qualified to be the Vice Chancellor if he is a member of, or otherwise associated with, any political party”.

Legally therefore, a VC “receiving” a Union minister attending the institution for a political event may be regarded as acting in a “partisan manner while in office” – a substantive ground for removal of a VC, as per the Act. It would be a patent lie to claim that such sights of servility are uncommon in state-funded higher educational institutions, but to openly demand them is to make peace with the feudal roots of the Indian university. To pretend otherwise is to at least acknowledge the difference between what is practised and what is just.

Babul Supriyo – representing a party whose prime minister believes that a Harvard degree is worth less than his own ‘hard work’ – was soon seen commanding the VC (now, an alleged ‘leftist’) to do some ‘work’ by fetching him a glass of water.

What is the ‘work’ that liberal metropolitan state universities (like Jadavpur University) are expected to do, and for which the provincial public-funded universities provide a model already? On September 18, just a day before Supriyo’s misadventure, the VC of the Central University of South Bihar – in the Hindi heartland of Gaya – set an example of the ‘hard working’ Indian university. This is an institution which has ranked itself into the dregs of the national frameworks of excellence, and aspires to ‘world-class’ pedagogy in the near future.

Having invited “His Holiness Puripeethadhishwar Jagatguru Shankaracharya Swami Nishchalananda Saraswati Jee” (the Puri Shankaracharya), the said VC was seen prostrating himself on stage while a newly-appointed teacher of physics was made to perform a ‘paduka-poojan’ (worshipping the saint’s footwear).

The VC welcomed the Lord Almighty’s delegate – in the presence of all local RSS functionaries – by ruing that he could not invite a ‘sant’ (saint) to inaugurate his university campus. However, this grand academic lecture, on the “nature and relevance of Vedic mathematics”, was his mode of penance. There was acoustic accompaniment all through, with vows of cow protection and demands for a ban on cow slaughter.

Needless to say, this was the accurate setting and build-up to a seminar that Supriyo perhaps wanted in Jadavpur University. But alas – unlike Shankaracharya, who ducked mathematics altogether to talk about how universities must counter materialist knowledge and communist belief-systems, Supriyo started flexing his muscles by linking ‘leftism’ to a VC. The ‘sant’ instead chronicled how the first batch of students from Banaras Hindu University – contrary to its founder Malaviya’s intentions – grew up to be “communists”, and how that long tradition of misdirected university learning is now sought to be corrected by cleaning (safaai) JNU of “communists”.

Clearly, Supriyo’s pronouncement on Jadavpur University’s VC is part of the “surgical strike” that BJP leaders have been plotting on college campuses. It is a strike which, as their patron-saint in Shankaracharya believes, will heal the Indian university of its germs of thinking and questioning the powers that be. The tottering Indian economy needs to re-erect the university as a ‘temple’ – of ‘learning’, as they say. Of learning to obey.

The Life Of Labour: Soaring Unemployment; Futile Budgetary Announcements,https://m.thewire.in/article/labour/the-life-of-labour-soaring-unemployment-futile-budgetary-announcements,"Feb 06, 2019  |  Venkat T., Srividya Tadepalli & Thomas Manuel","Unemployment rate at a four decade high: NSSO survey

In a rude shock to the country, but unsurprising vindication of some economists, the leaked NSSO survey on employment for 2017-2018, published by Business Standard, revealed that the unemployment rate had hit 6.1%, levels unseen in the last four decades.

The data also revealed a negative trend in the labour force participation rate, especially among women, with only a quarter in employment or seeking employment. Youth unemployment in both rural and urban areas also showed a significant rise, causing concerns about a demographic backlash instead of the ‘dividend’ that the NDA government was to unleash.

The other side of the story was that this was not a government publication but a ‘leak’. While the NITI Aayog called a press conference to debunk the ‘draft’ report, questions arose as to why a government think-tank, rather than the National Statistics Commission, was sitting on the data, which usually is vetted and released by the NSC.

This tussle between the two organisations needs to be seen in the light of two senior independent members, including the acting chairperson, resigning from the NSC earlier last week. This is what P.C. Mohanan, the acting person who resigned in protest, had to say about the issue, the leaked survey and its inferences.

Who is bearing the burden of jobless growth?

Official or not, the Indian economy is struggling in the aftermath of quixotic economic policies like demonetisation. Government and non-government research on employment has shown the erosion of jobs in both the rural and urban economies. The more alarming issue is that the burden of unemployment has fallen on educated youth and women at a disproportionately higher level. This article in The Wire illustrates this in three charts.

Budget 2019 and farmers: Basic income

“This won’t benefit much, but it is better than nothing,” one farmer told Forbes India, capturing the sense of futility around the government’s recent announcements during the Union budget.

One major scheme was the announcement of Rs 6,000 per year to farmers with two or less hectares of land. This scheme is being described as basic income for farmers and will cost the government around Rs 75,000 crore. But despite being touted as new and vital, the scheme is simply a smaller version of an existing scheme in some states.

“In comparison, the Rythu Bandhu scheme of the Telangana government provides Rs10,000 per acre of support, which means that a 5-acre farmer would get Rs 50,000 per year, giving at least partial support towards cultivation cost. It is a joke to declare that the meagre Rs 6,000 per year will save farmers from the moneylenders, when a typical small farmer requires an investment of at least Rs 1 lakh in cost of cultivation,” Kirankumar Vissa from Rythu Swarajya Vedika in Telangana told Down to Earth magazine.

Accenture to sell automation software that allowed it to cut 40,000 jobs

Accenture says all their workers who were rendered ‘redundant’ because of a software were retrained and placed in other departments. But it’s clear that SynOps, their new product, is meant to eliminate jobs for its potential customers.

The software essentially automated a lot of tasks in finance, marketing and procurement. These are tasks that are often done in back offices based out of India or other developing countries. And by allowing them to benchmark their processes against competitors, it’s setting up a race for “leanness” that takes no cognisance of the human cost.

Taxi driver in Tamil Nadu commits suicide alleging police harassment

In a video recorded on his phone before he took his own life, a taxi driver in Chennai described how he was regularly harassed by police officers who made his life miserable. “Police verbally abused me in the presence of a woman customer (occupant) when I had parked my vehicle in the parking zone. Yesterday when I sleeping inside my car, parked on a service road, police tried to lock and tow away my car and demanded money,” Murthy, the driver, said in the video.

Despite naming the police as the sole cause of his death, the commissioner of police seemed to question his intentions and the truth of the claims, blaming him for taking his life instead of filing a complaint.

In his video, Murthy said he wanted to be the last person driven to suicide by police harassment while they were struggling to make a livelihood. It doesn’t look like the police has any intention of making that the case.

Indian homeworkers are paid pennies to work on clothes for international fashion brands

A report by Siddharth Kakra at the University of California, Berkeley reveals the state of unregulated home-based work in north India. Based more than a thousand interviews, the report states that, “Nearly all were female, and more than 99%, it turned out, were either Muslim or part of a low caste,” according to Quartz.

Most workers were working for Western clothing brands and had started working when they were minors. They were being paid much less than the approved minimum wage and most of them reported that they had started working in this way because of financial distress.

This form of industry that might be employing hundreds of thousands of people exploits those who are already suffering and have no options, so that people in the US and Europe can have cheaper clothes. A senior official in the labour department told Reuters that they would “undertake a headcount of unorganized workers in 125 sectors – including garment manufacturing – and give them an identification number that will help them avail social security schemes”.

India’s first attempt at regulating fishing trawlers underway

Last week, a Central government committee was set up to recommend ways to reduce India’s Trawling Fleet.

“It was agreed that there is a need to reduce the number of trawlers for two main reasons. One that there is excess catch and two to reduce the damage on the ocean bed and to the ecology that bottom trawlers cause,” said the director of the Bay of Bengal Programme Inter-Governmental Organisation.

Trawlers are medium-sized ships with nets that sweep the ocean floors, scraping it off en masse with all life forms. Adding to this is the fine mesh size of the nets that do not let juveniles and sometimes even eggs and larvae escape. Several conservationists and activists have called for a complete ban on trawl nets as they indiscriminately destroy all life forms.

Experts have called for a complete ban, stating that the time for half measures is long gone. Interestingly, in Tamil Nadu the trawler fishers are themselves of the opinion that this form of fishing is harmful and are willing to change if offered credible incentives.

JACTO GEO withdraws strike after state refuses to negotiate

Teachers and government employees were forced to withdraw their nine-day strike on March 31 after the state refused to negotiate with them and went on to initiate criminal and disciplinary action against many union leaders.

Facing police pressure and the lack of public sympathy, the federation decided to call of the strike. However, they are still facing state government action like transfers for participating in the strike. In Kotagiri, the punishment transfer of two teachers has led to a protest by parents.

Analysing the strike, Thozhillalar Koodam published an editorial on the need for government employees and unions to improve their public image and support.

"As the Splintered History of Lost Kingdoms Unravels, India, China Need to Confront the Future",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/splintered-history-lost-kingdoms-unravels-india-china-need-confront-future,"Jul 01, 2017  |  Pradip Phanjoubam","Wedged between Sikkim and Bhutan, Doklam in Tibet’s Chumbi valley points like a dagger at the Siliguri corridor connecting the Northeast with the rest of India.

It is interesting that in invoking historical justifications in the latest standoff between China and India in the Sikkim and Bhutan tri-junction area, neither party is keen to recall that the region once constituted sovereign principalities – of Tibet, Sikkim and Bhutan. Of the three, Bhutan is still independent, Tibet was taken over by China in 1951 and Sikkim became part of India only in 1975 by the exercise of Article 2 of the Indian constitution. The controversies behind these takeovers is another matter, but the moot point is that the histories of these erstwhile states have been splintered beyond recognition as they have been absorbed into other historical streams. How much of this destroyed history can, with any moral legitimacy, continue to be used as alibis by China or India to advance their interests in the region is the unasked question.

China cites the 1890 agreement between itself and the British government fixing the boundary between Sikkim and Tibet, claiming that this is the boundary Indian troops have violated in objecting to Chinese road construction in Doklam. Britain signed this agreement with China in acknowledgment that China had suzerainty power over Tibet; however, the latter disputed this and refused to recognize the 1890 treaty and another one, signed again by the British and Chinese in 1893, on trade regulations – which allowed the setting up of a British India trade mart at Yatung in the Chumbi valley. The buildup to these treaties a decade earlier is not only interesting but also marked an important turning point in the triangular diplomacy between the British, Chinese and Tibetans.

The British had for long been looking for a permanent presence in Tibet and towards this end in 1886, they planned a trade mission to Lhasa under the command of an officer by the name of Colman Macaulay. This was in keeping with the Chefoo Convention reached between the British and the Chinese in 1876 in Peking. The Chinese, though not in a position at the time to oppose the British, had weakly conveyed their reluctance, saying the plan would be opposed by the Tibetans ­ – indicating they were unsure of their control over Tibet.

The Macaulay mission was ultimately suspended, but for reasons many scholars, including Alastair Lamb, suspect had little to do with the British not wanting to embarrass the Chinese at their inability to control the Tibetans. The real reason was that the British had tacitly coerced the Chinese to recognise the British annexation of Upper Burma in 1885 – a country Manchu rulers considered their tributary state.

Events that followed again proved Chinese apprehensions that Tibetans would oppose the British trade mission was not just an excuse to dissuade the British. Not knowing the mission had been called off, the Tibetans

‘sent a detachment into the British-protected State of Sikkim, a region to which they now reasserted ancient claims. In Sikkim, at the village of Lingtu, on the main road from Darjeeling to the Tibetan border at the Chumbi Valley, along which Colman Macaulay was expected to travel, the Tibetans set up a military post; and they refused to retreat even after there ceased to be any question of a British mission.’ (Alastair Lamb, The McMahon Line, A Study in Relation Between India, China and Tibet 1904-1914, Vol 1)

Explaining the same episode, a British official and Tibetan observer of the time, Charles Bell, notes that the Tibetan were instigated by

‘the Ne-chung Oracle at Lhasa, which declared that its magic influence inside the fort would disarm any troops that the British sent against it, while the occupation would give them a commanding position in any negotiations that took place for the delimitation of the boundary between Tibet and Sikkim.’ (Charles Lamb, Tibet Past and Present).

What followed is of importance. Despite repeated appeals by the British to the Chinese to have the blockade lifted, the Chinese were not in a position to do anything. It was then that Lord Dufferin in 1888 authorised the clearing of the blockade by force, which was done promptly and without much problem. Dufferin also became convinced then that the only way to deal with Tibet was to deal with it directly and not through Peking. However, despite the Lingtu blockade episode, the British did not abandon their policy outlook towards Tibet immediately, and the 1890 boundary treaty and the 1893 trade treaty were signed with Peking not with Lhasa.

One of the reasons, as scholars point out, is that the Tibet anxiety of the British was informed by the possibility of other European powers, in particular Russia, coming to influence Tibet. This being so, entering into international treaties with Tibet, it feared would give the Tibetans de jure sovereignty status in the eye of international law and this may encourage the Tibetans to enter into independent treaties with other European rivals. To the British, then, China was the lesser danger.

Things however changed under Lord Curzon. When towards the turn of the century, he became convinced that the 13th Dalai Lama was leaning towards Russia, he authorised the Younghusband Mission in 1904, to invade and teach the Tibetans a lesson. Col Francis Younghusband did precisely this and in a brutal act of aggression captured Lhasa. Though the 13th Dalai Lama managed to escape to Mongolia before he entered Lhasa, Younghusband forced the Lhasa Convention with the Tibetan government. Among the many humiliating concessions, the Tibetans were coerced into agreeing to pay a war indemnity of Rs. 75 lakh, an amount thought to be beyond the capacity of Tibet to pay, and until this amount was paid up, Chumbi valley was to remain with India. Not only this, the Rs. 75 lakh was to be paid in an instalment of Rs. 1 lakh a year, ensuring thereby that even if the Tibetans paid up, Chumbi valley would remain with India for at least 75 years.

The Younghusband mission was not met with appreciation among all in Britain. Among those who held it in contempt was Lord Morley, Secretary of State for India. The latter ultimately ended up undoing most of what was achieved by the Younghusband mission, including the virtual transfer of Chumbi valley to India. First the amount was reduced to Rs. 25 lakh, and then, not long after Curzon retired in 1905, he acceded to a demand of the Chinese – who had, in a masterly stroke of diplomacy that won them prestige in the eyes of the Tibetans and strengthened before the world the legitimacy of their claims over Tibet – that Peking pay the Rs. 25 lakh on behalf of the Tibetans and also have the amount paid in just three instalments, ensuring thereby that the Chumbi valley returned to Tibetan custody in three years. With Curzon out of the way, China also convinced the British government that the Lhasa agreement can only be acceptable if it is ratified by another treaty between the British and Chinese, and this came to be so by the Peking Convention of 1906.

What became evident at the time was also the difference in security perceptions between British India and the British Empire. For men like Curzon in India, controlling Tibet was important for India’s security. For men like Morley in London, this interest was only a small and incomplete wrinkle on the larger security map of the empire. In Morley’s words, what Britain does in Tibet, other rivals may want to do in other sensitive regions like Mongolia, Afghanistan, Iran etc. He even derisively referred to men like Curzon as “these frontier men”, calling them too raw to understand the intricacies of the larger interest of the empire. But in the end, it was the empire which dissolved, leaving the colonies to bear the burdens of the exertions made on their behalf. The uncertainties over India’s northern boundary is a prime example.

The Bhutan case is also interesting for another reason. British India concluded an important treaty with Thimphu in 1910 by which Bhutan was to pursue its foreign policy in consultation with India. What prompted this treaty was the Chinese forward policy that began in 1908 in what is generally described as the Qing Dynasty’s last burst of desperate energy before is collapse in 1912 in the face of the Republican Revolution, a tumultuous period in Chinese history captivatingly depicted in the Hollywood classic, The Last Emperor.

Chinese troops entered Tibet, forcing the 13th Dalai Lama who was on his way back to Lhasa from his exile in Mongolia, to flee to India. The Chinese not only took charge of Tibet, but also began probing the neighbouring principalities of Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan. The British were not worried about Sikkim which was their protectorate, nor too much about Nepal either for the latter had a robust army, but they became very concerned about Bhutan. At the time, the British had only an 1865 treaty with Bhutan but this was an agreement for the Bhutias not to raid the Dooars plains and for this the British would pay a compensation, much like the Posa arrangement the Ahom kings in Assam made with the hill tribes as a conflict resolution mechanism. This treaty however would not have been able to protect Bhutan if the Chinese decided to enter it. The British, at the behest of Charles Bell, who was then their political officer in Sikkim, visited the Bhutan king in 1910, and had the latter agree to sign a new treaty which merely added one more clause to the 1865 treaty – that Bhutan would pursue its foreign affairs in consultation with India. The Chinese threat, however, did not last as the Qing Dynasty soon fell. Not long after, in 1913, the British called the Simla Conference in an effort to secure India’s boundary in this sector.

The history of this boundary is murky, and it gives no one any credit to invoke it to justify present policies. The current standoff between India and China on this border probably has, as so many commentators have pointed out, nothing to do with this history, but with current realpolitik. In the wake of India leaning towards the United States, and the US allegedly attempting to use India as a pivot to counterweigh China, Beijing probably is sending a message to New Delhi that it can have a better friend nearer home, and equally, a worse adversary nearer home.

The two giants need to acknowledge certain truths. On China’s part, it needs to understand India’s concern about the Chumbi valley where the mutual allegations of border incursions are being made. This narrow valley wedged between Sikkim and Bhutan, points like a dagger at the Chicken’s Neck or Siliguri corridor, which connects the Northeast with the rest of India. It is, therefore, legitimate for India to be worried about a dagger pointed at his neck even if the dagger is not touching its neck or the wielder of the dagger is a friend. On India’s part, since Tibet is now Chinese territory, it is legitimate for the latter to connect its territories by roads. A settlement, if any, will have to be placed between these two concerns.

India Must Focus on Quality Education as a Solution to Sexual Violence,https://m.thewire.in/article/education/india-education-sexual-violence-women,"May 26, 2018  |  Asadullah","The recent wave of sexual violence reported from across the country – against women in general and little girls in particular – is not only disturbing but also thought-provoking. The response of the civil society, media and government towards these deplorable instances has largely been ad hoc and reactionary, both in terms of form and substance. There has been a tendency to discuss sexual violence against women only after a particularly gruesome incident or the reporting of a series of such incidents. After that, the debate slowly fades away.

By completely disregarding the extensive sexual violence perpetrated against women on a daily basis, we obstruct the process of building a narrative around this malaise. As for the substance of the debate, it is always reactionary. The possible ‘solutions’ to the ‘problem’ emerging from the debate are largely confined to: public execution of the culprit, a ‘new tougher law’, better implementation of the existing laws, improved measures for security, encouraging women to speak up against abuse and social transformation – shedding patriarchy and creating a culture of respecting women. While a few of these ‘solutions’ are simply outrageous, others might be effective in varying degrees.

The government, while conveniently and selectively buying people’s arguments, usually comes up with ‘newer’ or ‘tougher laws’ to prosecute sexual offences against women and children. Notwithstanding the evidence that deterrence out of fear of retribution is limited, the provision of punitive measures besides being ‘visible’ and ‘quick action’ is much easier to introduce than a cultural shift or an attitude transformation which might actually offer a lasting solution.

Role of school education

The big question, however, is how to initiate and accomplish this cultural shift and attitude transformation. It is hugely surprising that the role of school education is rarely taken into account while addressing this question. The debate on ensuring quality education these days never goes beyond learning levels, student scores in literacy and numeracy, skill acquisition or competency development and percentage of marks scored.

One might wonder whether it is purely idealistic or outrightly foolish to expect quality education to help society address issues like patriarchy, discrimination against social groups who are perceived vulnerable and, above all, violence. If the answer is yes, then how are we going to achieve cultural transformation or attitude change to form a society which rejects patriarchy, discrimination and violence, particularly, sexual violence against women? If the answer is no, then why is the role of education not being considered as one of the measures to effectively and sustainably address these issues? Why the outcomes for quality education being pushed by the government through its different institutions not refer to the attitudinal change and social transformation with regard to these very serious issues an outcome as well?

Interestingly, India’s National Policy on Education (NPE), 1968 does clearly assign to education the role of social transformation. It states ‘… Education has an acculturating role. It refines sensitivities and perceptions that contribute to national cohesion, a scientific temper and independence of mind and spirit”. (Emphasis added)

In fact, the perspective of Indian academics has been even more lucid much before the NPE. Radha Krishnan (whose birth anniversary is celebrated as Teachers Day) for instance, puts in perspective the educational outcome in terms of knowledge, skill and social transformation. He states:

“The aim of education is not the acquisition of information although important, or acquisition of technical skills, though essential in modern society, but the development of that bent of mind, that attitude of reason, that spirit of democracy which will make us responsible citizens”.

Key issues missing in the discourse on quality education

Evidently, government’s agenda for quality education is neither in policy perspective nor does it take into account prevailing social realities giving rise to violence, particularly, sexual violence against women. The short-term outcome-focused approach to quality education that has little regard for critical enablers of quality in terms of content and process i.e. curriculum and pedagogy, conveniently ignores the National Curriculum Framework, NCF (2005).

The NCF underscores the need to view the representation of knowledge in textbooks and other materials from the larger perspective of the challenges facing humanity and the nation. It notes that no subject in the school curriculum can stay aloof from these larger concerns, and therefore the selection of knowledge proposed to be included in each subject area requires careful examination in terms of socio-economic and cultural conditions and goals.

Despite the NCF being endorsed under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, curricular reforms (which include reforms in; curriculum, textual material, teaching – learning processes and assessment of pupils’ learning) to address the issues of patriarchy, discrimination, intolerance and violence do not find mention in the discourse on quality education.

Obstacles facing quality education

Myopic vision is not the only challenge between us and quality education, poor institutional capacity and a serious shortage of public resource are equally overwhelming obstacles. A major reason for the absence of curricular reforms from the discourse on quality education is government’s complete dependence for public provisioning of school education on schematic interventions like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan. These schemes focus at best on medium-term objectives. They have little scope and even lesser funds for interventions to improve curriculum and pedagogy beyond poorly funded, low-quality teacher training.

On the other hand, the institutional capacity for curriculum and pedagogy-related research and development that plays a critical role in curricular reform has either waned or has failed to come up on account of poor planning and perennially meagre public provisioning. The institutional capacity has been significantly inadequate at the national and state levels (NCERT, NCTE and SCERTs) whereas, at the district level, it is almost extinct in most places.

The District Institute of Education and Training (DIET), the sole institution for curriculum and pedagogic research and training at the district level, is barely surviving. Since most districts have several thousand teachers working in hundreds of government schools, therefore, DIETs’ crucial role in addressing the need for academic support, guidance and curricular development is absolutely crucial. Unfortunately, DIETs are in no position to fulfill this huge obligation. Of the 700 odd districts in the country, over a hundred districts have no DIET. Around 600 DIETs which are functional in as many districts have a little less than 50% vacancy in their academic (faculty) positions.

The salary cost against the filled academic posts is shared between Centre and states in 60:40 ratio under the Central government-sponsored Teacher Education (TE) scheme. The outlays (Centre plus states share) for the last many years have remained at around Rs 700 crore, which is barely enough to support the salary component of filled up academic positions. This leaves virtually no funds for research, development and programme work. The TE scheme with well above 90% expenditure over the last several years is a classic evidence refuting government’s claim that public resource allocation for social sector is adequate and the problem lies with expenditure efficiency alone.

Coming back to the issue of sexual violence against women and its sustainable solution, the discourse must inform at least three points of engagement for civil society and polity, including – sexual violence against women cannot be addressed by legal and security measures alone, social transformation through quality education is a more comprehensive and sustainable solution; present discourse on quality education is short-sighted besides being oblivious to prevailing social realities including sexual violence against women, which is out of sync with India’s policy perspective on quality education; and institutional capacity and public resources required to address these issues through quality education including curricular reforms in line with our policies, are highly inadequate.

The big question is whether we as a society sense the need, the urgency and the opportunity to demand through popular mobilisation in an election year a commitment from the political dispensation to address these issues, comprehensively and sustainably. If we could do this, it will be a good first step in a long journey.

The question assumes significance as a little less than one-third of our total population is in the schooling stage, spending a significant portion of their time every day on learning alone. This population, nearly half of it being women, would exercise maximum influence on social and political discourse in the country over the next half a century at least – good enough a future, quality education must envision and plan for."

Quibbling About Polls Doesn't Change the Fact that Women Aren't Safe in India,https://m.thewire.in/article/women/quibbling-about-polls-doesnt-change-the-fact-that-women-arent-safe-in-india,"Jun 28, 2018  |  Nehmat Kaur","When the Reuters poll declared India the most dangerous country for women, I didn’t realise that it would cause such an uproarious denial. Some people have criticised it as wrongly labelling itself a ‘survey’ saying it is, at best, a poll. Well, the headline itself says ‘poll’ not ‘survey’. Rightly, its scope is small, and the 500-odd experts don’t necessarily have to be taken at their word. ‘India is not the most dangerous’ seems to be the argument many want to make. That India is at all dangerous seems besides the point. The most dangerous and infuriating rebuttal has come in the form of the personal anecdote. Those who have confidently declared that nothing ‘bad’ has ever happened to them on Indian soil. To them, I don’t know what else to say but ‘Good for you’ or ‘That must be nice’.

For me, the Reuters headline landed with a dull thump on top of an ever-growing pile of others. Every new headline about women in India prompts my brain to throw up a newsreel of the recent ones. Right off the top of my head, here are the things that have hit our eyes and ears in recent weeks.

Our external minister, Sushma Swaraj, was mercilessly abused online in vilely sexist terms for supporting an inter-religious couple. It’s hard to think the words ‘online abuse’ and not remember Rana Ayyub, who made international news by writing about the verbal abuse and bodily threats she gets on a daily basis? Why? For doing her job as a journalist. She is just one of many women who regularly click open their inboxes to find graphic rape threats, dick pics, pictures of human shit and incoherent, palpable rage waiting for them.

But my brain is not done yet. It goes just a little bit further back and reminds me that our national TV news channels recently exposed the identity of a survivor, flashing her face on millions of TV screens, violating the law, journalistic norms and her personhood. All for TRPs.

A little further still and I remember that I wrote a piece titled ‘No Country for Women’ – a tired headline for the weary, heartbreaking process of coming to terms with the news and reactions coming out of Kathua and Unnao. Where several of our countrymen chose to justify the rape and torture of a child for the sake of identity politics.

And before that even, we all rose up in our armchairs, outraged by the fact that open defecation isn’t just more dangerous health-wise for women, but also deadlier. Men hide in the fields, waiting to assault women as they go to ‘answer nature’s call’ or whatever the ‘cultured’ phrase for this essential life act is.

Raise your hand if you wake up with a sense of dread gripping your heart most mornings. Raise your hand if you’ve constructed your wardrobe to reflect your mood – the main one being fear of assault. Keep it raised if you take Ubers even when you can’t afford them, because coming home after dark is a terror you want to avoid. Raise your hand if you stay out late, but lie to your concerned parents, assuring them you’re “being safe” and not doing anything ‘dangerous’ or human, like meeting friends for drinks after work. Keep it raised if you never go out without planning exactly how you’ll get home.

Many of us have the privilege of circumventing potential assaulters, of accessing protection like the comfort of a chauffeur-driven car. That obviously doesn’t mean that the problem does not exist. Yes, you may have experienced catcalling in another country and brushed it off. But here’s why the same behaviour can inspire fear in India, but not necessarily elsewhere. In India, if ‘anything’ happens, you pretty much know that the law – the thing that is supposed to serve and protect you – won’t help.

There’s another reason such anecdotal dismissals are gravely dangerous. Imagine the young girl who reads such a piece and thinks that wearing long pants, sharing her location with her parents at all times and only travelling in her family’s car will keep her safe. None of these things actually prevent assault, but if she doesn’t know that, what’s to stop her from blaming herself if such a thing happens? What’s to stop her from thinking that she can’t share this experience with anyone because it clearly doesn’t happen to everyone? What’s to stop her from internalising this as shame? How will she know it’s okay to vocalise her experience and seek help and justice?

Think of the domestic worker who is regularly harassed by the men whose houses she cleans. The Dalit student who finds herself at the mercy of a musty old, well-connected Brahmin scholar. Those women who have heard so many stories of assault that they turn down jobs in other cities, afraid of being alone and unprotected.

Those who say they have never experienced anything even remotely resembling assault or harassment are closing down the already-slim space for those who have – and believe you me, the latter are far greater in number.

When I was 18, my driving instructor waited till the very last day of lessons to grope me. Repeatedly. Over the course of an hour. While my mother sat in the backseat, oblivious. She was obviously there because in her head – and mine – that was one way to prevent what was clearly happening. I felt so ashamed, I never uttered a word. Not even to the friend who had hired the same instructor. Years later, when I still didn’t have a license and my mother suggested getting in touch with the same instructor again, I managed to make a squirmy face and calm my breath enough to say, ‘He was very touchy’ and left it at that. I wouldn’t even have managed that much if it weren’t for all the women who said ‘Me too’.

There have been other incidents, more ‘serious’ ones that I have been able to talk about. But never this one, because this one happened in a way and place that I was assured it could not happen.

I know now that it happens all the time. And I’m saying it now in the hopes that someone who reads some other woman’s account of always being safe in her car with her driver, will also know that she’s not alone if something does happen to her.

Personal anecdotes are powerful – that’s why Me Too resonated so wide and far. Because for too long before that the only stories women shared were the ones in which not being assaulted was presented as an achievement.

Being harassed or assaulted doesn’t make you inferior and talking about it doesn’t make you an attention-seeker or a liar.

It doesn’t matter if India is really the most dangerous country for women. It does matter that too many women in India live in a constant state of fear. Because our newspapers tell us exactly how bad the worst possible situation is, they also tell us exactly how often that happens to women around us. And our government’s silence tells us that we’re on our own. So when we walk home alone at night and arrive in one piece – mentally and physically – we treat it as a miracle, as the chance to live a so-far charmed life for another day. We don’t need a poll to tell us this is not normal, nor is it okay."
Can Budgeted Infrastructure Investment Drive Growth and Job Creation?,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/budgeted-infrastructure-investment-job-growth,"Feb 08, 2017  |  Santosh Mehrotra","Spending on Housing for All, road construction and other infrastructure projects is likely to create jobs, but it remains to be seen whether this alone will be enough.

India was the fastest growing large economy of the world with its 7.6% GDP growth rate in 2015-16. This is the fastest the Indian economy grew in the five years since 2011-12. Growth may lower by at least 0.5% and perhaps by one percentage point in 2016-17, the Ministry of Finance’s Economic Survey admits. But will it continue to grow at this pace in 2017-18? What can we say on the basis of the Budget for 2017-18?

Equally importantly, economic growth is meaningful not for its own sake, but mainly because it creates the possibility of new non-agricultural jobs. Job growth leads to an increase in consumer demand, which has the effect of sustaining GDP growth and in turn encouraging greater private investment and reducing growth volatility.

More people, less jobs

New non-agricultural jobs created between 1999-2000 and 2004-5 were 7.5 million per annum (but then the increase in entrants to the labour force was 12 million per annum). However, between 2004-5 and 2011-12, the additions to the labour force were only 2 million per annum. Meanwhile, due to sustained private investment, GDP growth was 8.4% per annum between 2004-5 and 2011-2. An additional 7.5 million new industrial and service sector jobs were created between 2004-5 and 2011-12. In other words, if the economy continues to grow rapidly India has already demonstrated an ability to generate at least 7.5 million new jobs annually over a 12 year period from 1999-2000 and 2011-12.

The new entrants to the labour force is not 12 million per annum, unlike what most people believe. The additions to the labour force had fallen sharply after 2004-5 because a growing number of children (6-14 year olds) were in school and higher numbers of 15-16 year olds were remaining in school. Secondary enrolment (classes 9-10) rose from 62% in 2010 to 79% in 2015. Since 2011-12, India is probably adding only 5-7 million better educated youth to the labour force per annum. In addition, since 2004-5, some five million are leaving agriculture, looking for non-agricultural work. Creating two different types of jobs for these two groups is the challenge facing the government. These two groups have rather different aspirations: the latter, with limited or no education or skills, are best absorbed in infrastructure-driven construction. The former, on the other hand, are better educated and may have some formally acquired skills, albeit limited. They will only look for modern services or manufacturing-related jobs. Has the Budget done anything to create jobs for these two groups?

The role of infrastructure investment

One of the most important sources of increased consumer demand since the turn of the century was the increase in infrastructure investment. Starting with the Golden Quadrilateral Highway network, which began construction in 2001, infrastructure investment picked up. As a result the number of workers in construction rose from 17 million in 1999-2000 to 26 million in 2004-05. Investment in infrastructure rose strongly thereafter and during the 11th five-year plan (2007-12), infrastructure investment in the public and private sector together grew by $475 billion or nearly $100 billion per annum. The result was that employment in construction jumped from 26 to 51 million, tripling compared to the turn of the century.

That is why the Rs 396 lakh (Rs 3.96 lakh crore or about $ 57 billion, up from Rs 3.48 lakh crore the previous year) investment in infrastructure in various sectors announced by finance minister Arun Jaitley announced on February 1, 2017 is welcome. However, that is nowhere close to the nearly $100 billion worth of infrastructure investment that was taking place during the 11th five-year plan period, which drove construction job growth at a historically unprecedented rate.

Job growth has been much slower since 2012. The labour bureau of the Ministry of Labour compiles statistics for job creation in eight major labour-intensive, non-agricultural sectors each quarter since the 2008 global financial crisis. In these eight sectors, the latest figures show that 1.35 lakh jobs were created in 2015, the lowest figure since 2008, lower than the 4.9 lakh new jobs in 2014 and 12.5 lakh in 2009.

The good news is that infrastructure public investment had picked up in 2015. The government acted to clear 42 stalled projects worth Rs 1.15 lakh crore since February 2015, which activated the idle investments locked in the projects. This began yielding results in 2016-17. Further unlocking of stalled projects will accentuate the GDP and construction job growth.

This is good news for the five million per annum who leave agriculture to look for work in construction. It is also good news for the underemployed persons aged 15 years and above who were available for work for all the 12 months of the year, but only 60% of them found work for more than six months (as the fourth annual survey of employment in 2013-14 noted).

What’s next

The railway infrastructure investments announced by the Budget 2017-18 include: 3,500km of railway lines to be commissioned in 2017-18 (as against the 2,800 km in 2016-17), 25 stations to be redeveloped and solar power for 2,000 stations. Roads will see an increase in allocation from Rs 52,447 crore (revised estimates) in 2016-17 to Rs 64,900 crore n 2017-18. In particular, 2,000 km of coastal connectivity roads will be constructed. The Optical Fibre Network (under BharatNet) has been laid in 1,55,000 km; from nothing the allocation for BharatNet is Rs 10,000 crore in 2017-18, with the objective of ensuring high-speed broadband connectivity on optical fibre in more than 1,50,000 gram panchayats.

Especially important for jobs in rural areas is the budgetary increase in investment in the Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sarak Yojana (PMGSY). Compared to the Rs 7,000-8,000 crore allocation to PMGSY in 2012-13 and Rs 9,000 crore in 2013-14, the allocation increased to Rs 19,000 crore in 2015-16 from the Union government. However, equally importantly, this is only 60%, since the remaining 40% is to come from the state governments; as a result the annual allocations will be Rs 27,000 crore total, taking into account both central and state expenditures. This same sum will be available for each of the next three years, until 2018-19; this has been assured to the Ministry of Rural Development by the finance ministry.

Such an increase in allocations automatically means rural roads will be constructed much faster than they were being done over 2011-14, the last three years of the UPA regime. The average construction of rural roads under PMGSY was 73 km per day over 2011-14; over 2014-16 that number had already gone up to about 100 km a day. With the increased allocation in the current financial year, it is expected to rise to 130 km a day, according to reliable senior sources in the Ministry of Rural Development. In 2017-18 and 2018-19 it is targeted to touch even higher. This is not unthinkable, as in earlier years, at its peak in 2009-10, construction of rural roads under PMGSY had reached 145 km a day.

Equally important is the focus on ‘Housing for All’, especially on low-income housing. In 2015-16 a total of 18.27 lakh houses were constructed under the rural housing scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (the erstwhile Indira Awaas Yojana). The government will have to construct around 35 lakh houses a year to meet its 2019 target. The Socio-Economic and Caste Census has been used toidentify close to three crore beneficiaries under the scheme.

In this context, the increase in allocation per house from the erstwhile Rs 35,000 per house for BPL families to Rs 1 lakh, should speed up the building of houses in rural areas by BPL households. However, for the Awas Yojana the challenge will to go beyond financial resources to limited labour and material availability. To double the pace of construction of houses, the Union government is recommending to states to use local material and technology to meet any shortage. The Budget announced a rural mason training programme to supply the workforce to expand these construction activities.

Similarly, the significant ramp up in spending on sanitation through the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan is also going to cause much more work creation in rural areas, in the building of toilets. Thus, expenditure on the Nirmal Bharat Abhyaan was Rs 2,250 crore in 2013-14. It had increased to Rs 2850 crore in the first year of the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan; but it jumped to Rs 6,524 cr in 2015-16. The allocation for 2016-17 is Rs 12,800 crore (RE) and last week’s Budget has increased it to Rs 16,248 crore in 2017-18.

Construction employment is, however, of limited important value for the 5-7 million young school-leavers who are joining the labour force, for whom the open unemployment rate is ten times higher than that of those 30 years and above. The unemployment rate for 15 to 17 year olds is 10.2% and for 18 to 29year olds is 9.4% in 2013, but 0.8% for over 30 year olds.

Private investment was down in the first half of 2016-17, 27% of GDP compared to 31% the previous year. Demonetisation has clearly reduced economic activity sharply since then and capacity utilisation is running at 70% in industry currently. With the ‘twin-balance sheet problem’ of over-leveraged companies and non-performing assets in banks, there is no possibility of an increase in private investment for the next three-four quarters. Given this situation, will public investment in infrastructure alone be able to carry the burden of sustaining GDP and job growth in the economy?

"Shelve Public Sector Bank Recapitalisation With RBI Funds, Yechury Tells Modi",https://m.thewire.in/article/banking/yechury-modi-banking,"Jul 08, 2016  |  Gaurav Vivek Bhatnagar","In his letter, Yechury also demanded that the government release the names of the top 100 loan defaulters and create an action plan to monetise their assets.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sitaram Yechury has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to shelve the plan to recapitalise public sector banks by withdrawing between Rs 3-4 lakh crore from the Reserve Bank of India’s capital base. “This is a dangerous idea as it diminishes RBI’s capacity to withstand internal and external economic shocks,” Yechury said in a letter to Modi. He also asked the prime minister to focus instead on recovering over Rs 8.55 lakh crore in bank loans which have not been returned by the borrowers.

In the letter delivered on Thursday, the CPI(M) general secretary demanded that under no circumstances should the plan to recapitalise banks be executed without an action plan for the recovery of unpaid loans. “Your government has not put the big business houses under any pressure to return the loans. They continue to flash their lavish lifestyles and their personal wealth remains unaffected,” he said.

Yechury’s letter has given enough indication that the issue will also be raised by the Left and other parties during the upcoming monsoon session of parliament. He urged Modi to put into practice an urgent action plan to start the recovery of pending loans from the top 100 borrowers, whose total non-performing assets (NPAs) stood at 19.3% as of March 2016, up from 0.7% in March 2015.

Countering the Modi government’s claims of seriousness about recovering the dues, the Left leader said, “while the NPAs have increased by nearly 80% in the last one year, it is sad to note that your government’s efforts for greater recovery have not shown any corresponding rise in the resolve to recover these”.

The total recovery in the financial year 2015-16, he continued, was Rs 1.28 lakh crore, which included 46% of this amount being written off and even then was only marginally higher than Rs 1.27 lakh crores recovered in the previous fiscal year. “This gives credence to the view that your government is not serious about recovering public money from these defaulters,’’ Yechury said.

Yechury also demanded that the names of defaulters be made public. “You must begin by making public their names with the due amount; the list is already available with the RBI, your government and the Supreme Court,” he said, adding that “failure to do so would mean that your government is making the poor Indians pay for the profligacy of these crony capitalists.”

The Communist party leader also asked the prime minister to “initiate an action plan to monetise the assets of all defaulters”, saying the “the plan to recapitalise the PSBs (public sector banks) by eroding RBI’s capital base must be shelved” and the principle of recovery first, recapitalisation later must be followed in letter and spirit by the government.

Yechury also came out in support of RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, saying it was the Asset Quality Review undertaken by the central banker and its Financial Stability Report which had shed light on the real health of the Indian economy. And yet, Yechury wrote to Modi, “your silence, while an important constitutional functionary was being viciously attacked, has led many to believe that you are not interested in completing the bad loan clean-up exercise. This leaves no other explanation but to conclude that your government actively patronises and promotes ‘crony capitalism’.”

Yechury in his letter also rubbished the prime minister’s promise before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to bring back black money and have Rs 15-20 lakh transferred into every individual’s bank account. “Leave alone your promise of bringing that amount back, money from the banking system under your watch, if the country’s top auditor is to be believed, has ‘been transferred abroad and may never get recovered’,” he wrote.

Giving a detailed account of how the RBI’s Financial Stability Report has pointed out that more than Rs 8,55,551 crore of the loans given by the banks have not been returned by the borrowers, Yechury wrote that as of end-March 2016, gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) of all scheduled commercial banks stood at Rs 5,60,822 crore, 7.71% of their gross advances of Rs 72,73,927 crore.Their restructured standard advances were at Rs 2,94,729 crore or 4.05% of the gross advances. He said, “this is every single Indian’s money which has been misappropriated by these borrowers, which are mainly big corporates.”

The CPI(M) leader said so deeply entrenched is this problem that even the comptroller and auditor General of India Shashi Kant Sharma stated at a recent public event that “there is a belief that a significant part of NPAs could be amounts fraudulently obtained as advances from the banking system. There is also a belief that a large part of these amounts may have been transferred abroad and may never get recovered”.

Worse, he said, the asset quality of the PSBs was even more critical with a stressed advances ratio of 14.5% in March 2016 which has created an alarming situation whereby the total market value of the PSBs was now far less than the GNPAs owed to them.

Yechury also noted that top ten corporate houses owe a staggering Rs 7 lakh crores to PSBs and financial institutions. Citing a Credit Suisse report of 2015, he said, the gross debt of Reliance Group was Rs 1.25 trillion, Vedanta Group Rs 1.03 trillion, Essar Group Rs 1.01 trillion, Adani Group Rs 96,031 crore, Jaypee Group Rs 75,163 crore, JSW Group Rs 58,171 crore, GMR Group Rs 47,976 crore, Lanco Group Rs 47,102 crore, Videocon Group Rs 45,405 crore and GVK Group Rs 33,933 crore.

Opposing the proposed moved to recapitalise the PSBs by using Rs 3-4 lakh crore from RBI’s capital base, he said, “this is a dangerous idea as it diminishes RBI’s capacity to withstand internal and external economic shocks”. Moreover, by becoming owners of these banks, the RBI will have mixed objectives as it conducts and regulates monetary policy, he reasoned.

Yechury said even Rajan had last month opposed the idea, which was first floated in this year’s annual economic survey, saying “this seems a non-transparent way of proceeding, getting the banking regulator once again into the business of owning banks, with attendant conflicts of interest”.

Opposing the move, Rajan had remembered how on the recommendations of the Malegam Committee, the government of India had bought RBI’s 59.7% stake in the State Bank of India at Rs 35,531 crore in 2007.

Yechury said while proposing the idea in the annual economic survey, the chief economic advisor (CEA) had also categorically warned that, “Most important, any such move would need to be initiated jointly and cooperatively between the government and the RBI. It will also be critical to ensure that any redeployment of capital would preserve the RBI’s independence, integrity and financial soundness – and be seen to do so.”

In accordance with the CEA’s warning, he said, the move to recapitalise the banks from RBI’s capital base, also opposed by the RBI governor himself, needs to be shelved. “The government must find a transparent way to do so, instead of surreptitiously trying to maintain its fiscal deficit by eroding RBI’s capital base,” he demanded."
Abolishing FIPB Hasn't Solved Underlying Flaws with India's Investment Approval Process,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/fipb-fema-investment-approval-process,"Jul 13, 2017  |  Pratik Datta, Radhika Pandey and Sumant Prashant","The shortcomings of the FIPB were merely symptoms of a deeper problem in the primary law, the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999.

Foreign investment into India has always been heavily regulated, requiring approvals from various government ministries. Post liberalisation, a need was felt to create a single window for foreign investors applying for such approvals. As a result, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) was established in August 1991. Initially it was placed within the prime minister’s office since its credibility needed to be projected speedily. Then it shifted to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) and finally to the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) in the Ministry of Finance. Here it functioned as an inter-ministerial body making recommendations to the finance minister for grant of approval for foreign investments as per the regulations under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.

Although the FIPB was a single window for foreign investors, at the back-end it was an agglomeration of various ministries whose views were necessary. It comprised secretaries from the DEA, the DIPP, the Department of Commerce, the Ministry of External Affairs, the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs, the Department of Revenue and the Ministry of Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises. Depending on the sector to which the investment proposal pertained, the concerned ministry would also be asked to give comments. At times, views of the RBI would also be sought. Naturally, this inter-ministerial coordination process took time and frequently delayed the approval process. Consequently, FIPB ended up being seen as another bureaucratic body delaying approvals. This fuelled the demand for a better substitute.

In a recent spate of reforms, the cabinet finally decided to scrap the FIPB. Now, foreign investment in any of the 11 notified sectors would require approval from the concerned administrative ministry. Last week the DIPP issued a Standard Operating Procedure for processing FDI proposals under this new regime. The most promising feature of this SoP is the 8-10 weeks time frame within which investment applications are required to be cleared by the government ministries. But will this reform ensure timely disposal of foreign investment approvals? To answer this, it would be useful to understand the legal institutional framework within which foreign investment approvals are processed in some advanced jurisdictions.

In Australia, the decision to approve a foreign investment proposal is with the treasurer under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, 1975. When making such decision, the treasurer is advised by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which examines foreign investment proposals and advises on the national interest implications. Section 77 of the 1975 Act requires the treasurer to make his decision within 30 days, which can be extended by 90 days. The treasurer has to give reasons for rejecting substantial commercial proposals, which are published in treasurer’s press release.

In Canada, the decision to approve a foreign investment proposal is with the minister under the Investment Canada Act, 1985. While taking the decision, the minister is advised by the director of investments. A foreign investor is required to notify the director before making an investment or within 30 days of making the investment. The investment proposal is subject to review only if the director sends a notice for review to the foreign investor within 21 days. The minister has 45 days to determine whether or not to allow the investment. The minister can unilaterally extend the 45-day period by an additional 30 days by sending a notice to the investor prior to the expiration of the initial 45-day period. Further extensions are permitted if both the investor and the minister agree. If no approval or notice of extension is received within the designated time, the investment is deemed approved. If a foreign investor’s application is rejected, the law requires the rejection order to provide reasons for such rejection. Moreover, another opportunity is given to the applicant to reapply. If the applicant is unable to make its case stronger in the second attempt, the application is finally rejected.

Evidently, in these jurisdictions the primary law imposes time-limits on the minister approving foreign investment proposals. The primary law is also clear on the precise purpose of the government approval. For instance, national security is a major concern while approving foreign investment proposals. Moreover, the primary law also lays down clear processes to handle rejection of investment applications, making the Minister more accountable. For instance, in the US, even the president, who has the final authority to reject an investment proposal, issues a presidential order providing justification for rejection. This institutional accountability hardwired within the legislative framework enables these jurisdictions to better handle foreign investment applications.

In contrast, the Indian primary law – the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) – does not create any institutional accountability. It does not prescribe any time limits for the finance minister to dispose of foreign investment applications. Neither is FEMA clear on the purpose of government approval itself. Further, the law does not require the government to give any reasons for rejecting an investment application. These are fundamental problems in the current Indian legal institutional framework around FDI approvals.

The DIPP’s new SoP does not resolve any of these fundamental issues. The timelines it imposes on the ministries for various actions are not even binding. This is because the SoP is not a legal instrument. It is merely a pdf document uploaded as a public notice on the DIPP website. That does not make it a law binding on the different ministries in the government. At most, it is an aspirational document laying out the good intentions of the government. But if a ministry violates it, there are no consequences or sanctions. The SoP does not in anyway change the internal incentive structure of the bureaucracy to ensure that they comply with the timelines. Therefore, the SoP fails to solve the root cause of delay at FIPB – lack of time-bound inter-ministerial coordination needed for timely grant of approvals.

Any reform to the Indian FDI approval regime must start with a complete rethinking and redesigning of the primary law – FEMA – from first principles. What is the market failure in the field of capital controls? Why is government approval even necessary? How can the government be made accountable to ensure that approval decisions are made in time-bound manner without prejudicing the main purpose of such approval?

The Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) answered these fundamental questions based on a holistic review of international best practices. It recommended that the objective of capital controls should be to address national security concerns. In addition the report envisaged controls of temporary nature to address crisis situation. All these aspects are codified in the chapter on capital controls in the Indian Financial Code, the draft law prepared by the FSLRC. Even as we debate the objectives of capital controls, the law on capital controls must be unambiguous in laying down an effective procedure for processing FDI proposals. As an example, clause 243 of the IFC provides for a 90 days time-bound process to be followed by the central government while approving or rejecting FDI proposals. Chapter 9 of the FSLRC Handbook released by the Ministry of Finance further elaborates this approval process.

The shortcomings of the FIPB were merely symptoms of a deeper problem in the primary law, FEMA. This underlying problem can be resolved only by replacing FEMA with a coherent new primary law. The new law should require government approval only for foreign investment in sectors that are strategic from the viewpoint of national security considerations or to address emergency situations such as war, or balance of payments crisis. The law should also focus on accountability of the government. It should provide clear time-bound legal processes and require the government to give reasoned orders while rejecting an investment proposal. Only such fundamental legislative reforms can help create a better substitute to FIPB.

Indian Steelmakers Face Debt Challenges After Ill-Timed Bets,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/indian-steelmakers-face-debt-challenges-after-ill-timed-bets,"Oct 30, 2019  |  Promit Mukherjee and Neha Dasgupta","Mumbai/New Delhi: India’s biggest steelmakers may be suffering from buyer’s remorse as assets they bought from bankrupt rivals stretch their bottom lines while market conditions have worsened.

Less than 18 months after scooping up these distressed assets in the hopes of extracting value and boosting market share, the steelmakers are struggling to meet sales and production targets because of a slowdown in the key construction and auto sectors.

Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd and others are also wrestling with falling revenues amid high debt loads.

“The operating environment has changed from when they bid for these plants,” said Amit Dixit, senior steel analyst with brokerage firm Edelweiss Financial Services. “So their payback period obviously gets elongated now.”

Steel prices were high and demand was booming then. Now, confronted with falling prices and slower consumption, steelmakers are facing the risk of credit downgrades, job losses and cuts in capital expenditure.

Also read: The Intriguing Case of a Massive Slowdown in the Auto Sector

Arnab Kumar Hazra, assistant secretary general at the Indian Steel Association, an industry group that also represents major steel producers, noted companies would take a longer time to turn their assets around in the current environment.

A deepening credit crunch in India’s shadow banking industry following the collapse of a major infrastructure lender in 2018 has sharply dented spending on cars and real estate in India.

Domestic steel consumption in September was at its lowest since the start of the fiscal year 2019/20, according to official data.

A synchronised global economic slowdown amid the US-China trade war has compounded the problem, quashing global steel consumption and intensifying competition among exporters.

JSW Steel Ltd, which bought Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd in September last year, had promised to turn it around within a year but now says it will take another year.

The company will also miss its sales and production target for 2019/20 by 3% and has had to cut its capital expenditure by a third, said Seshagiri Rao, JSW’s joint managing director and group chief financial officer.

“There is a credit squeeze, there is prolonged monsoon, a weaker government expenditure and fall in consumer demand,” Rao said.

Tata Steel, which bought specialty steel firm Usha Martin Ltd in April, told Reuters the turnaround of the company would be delayed.

Tata Steel and JSW are not alone.

The world’s biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal and partner Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp, which committed $6 billion to acquire a 10 million tonne steel plant in India, will face similar issues, analysts have said.

Pressure Building

The problems afflicting the steel majors, which together control over half the country’s total steel production, have already surfaced among mid-sized firms.

“Inventory is high, debtor days have extended, and most mid-level steel companies are now contemplating job cuts,” said R.K. Goyal, managing director of Kalyani Steels Ltd which relies heavily on the automotive sector for steel orders.

The credit crunch and slowdown in autos and real estate pushed India’s GDP growth to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter, in a troubling sign for the steel sector whose fortunes are closely tied to the broader economy.

The extent of the slowdown is prompting companies to revise capital expenditure plans and others to question the ability of companies to achieve debt reduction goals.

Despite Tata Steel’s move to partially defer expenditure on expansions, IIFL analyst Anupam Gupta said its plans to cut debt by $1 billion this fiscal year look ambitious, given weakening profitability across India and Europe.

Brokerage firm Edelweiss expects both JSW Steel and Tata Steel to see increases this year in their debt to EBIDTA ratios – a metric that reflects the cash available to companies to pay debts.

And the downward pressure on steelmakers does not look set to reverse soon.

“We are just sitting idle and waiting for the tide to turn,” Kalyani Steels’ Goyal said.

"Indonesia's Balancing Act: A Road With China, a Port With India",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/indonesia-china-india-modi-belt-and-road,"May 30, 2018  |  The Wire Staff","(This story was originally published on May 18 as is being republished to coincide with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Jakarta)

New Delhi: When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi travels to Indonesia later this month, his first stop was supposed to be the port of Sabang, where he was to inaugurate a hospital and port development facilities, said Indonesian coordinating minister for maritime affairs Luhut Pandjaitan.

In a lecture at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, Pandjaitan said India’s role in developing Sabang, a port city in the Aceh province, would ensure a bit of a balance in the South China Sea.

“This is my personal view. When your prime minister is in Sabang, you can give a balance of power… Prime Minister Modi’s plan is to open a hospital and have a sea port. The sea port there is very deep, with 25 metres depth,” he said to the audience on Thursday (May 17).

There were initially plans to have Modi travel at least some distance to Sabang on a ship to visually depict maritime neighbourliness. He would have been following in the footsteps of India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who travelled to Indonesia on INS Delhi in June 1950.

However, a senior member of the Indonesian delegation told The Wire that due to bad weather, Modi’s ship journey may have to be cancelled. A ship visit by an head of government would also have been a logistical nightmare, therefore Sabang was taken off the schedule.

Modi will be travelling to Indonesia on May 29 for a three-day visit, which will start in Jakarta.

In the run-up to the visit, Pandjaitan, who is a strongman in Indonesian politics, is in Delhi to hold talks with national security advisor Ajit Doval, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and other Indian cabinet ministers.

He said that Indonesia would like to see more investment in the Sabang port free trade zone.

It is learnt that the main thrust of Modi’s visit to Indonesia will be to demonstrate that both countries are actually close maritime neighbours. The shortest distance between the Andaman Islands and Aceh is just 80 nautical miles.

H.E. Mr. @LuhutPandjaitan delivers a very enlightening Public Lecture on “Indonesia’s Maritime Policy & Thinking of Ways Forward for India-Indonesia as Maritime Neighbours” in #NewDelhi. We can do many things together to develop a closer relationship between two countries. pic.twitter.com/MEGR5ricx5 — IndonesianEmbassy ND (@KBRI_NewDelhi) May 17, 2018

The Indonesian minister asserted that there should not be “any power projection” in the South China Sea. Indonesia has traditionally held that it is not part of the dispute over the South China Sea.

In 2016, there were clashes in the waters near the Natuna islands. These waters are claimed by both China and Indonesia. A year later, Jakarta renamed the contested waters the North Natuna Sea, and has been fortifying military facilities in nearby islands.

During the question and answer, Pandjaitan was asked specifically about Indonesia’s position on the reported deployment of Chinese missiles in the South China Sea. Dodging the question, he replied that Indonesia has “tried very carefully to respond” on this issue.

He said that it was important to “carefully engage (on) this one in order to avoid any conflict among ASEAN members”. He noted that countries like Myanmar and Cambodia had a difference of opinion with respect to China’s actions.

Indonesia’s response to the July 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration had been to call on all parties to exercise restraint, to not take steps to escalate tensions and to respect the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. However, the Indonesian official statement did not make any reference to the ruling.

Pandjaitan said that he had once asked his Chinese counterpart about the basis of their Nine-Dash Line claim. “They said three things. Number one, historical, number two, because of sentiments from the mainland and number three, because of Admiral Zheng He. If you talk of sentiment, then Krakatoa and Tambora (volcanic) explosion 200-300 years ago also threw up a lot of ash around the globe. Then I can claim parts of Asia, Beijing and New York.”

He also added that the ideal way to manage tensions with China is not to go before the media. “If we have a problem, we contact (each other) and solve them. It is a better solution to minimise tension… We honour their sovereignty, but you have to also discuss our sovereignty,” he said.

When asked about Indonesia’s position on the Belt and Road Initiative, he said, “We don’t want to be controlled by the Belt and Road…We are also promoting our Global Maritime Fulcrum…It is to balance the One Belt, One Road.”

A former military officer, Pandjaitan admitted that Indonesia, despite being an archipelagic nation, had taken the maritime domain for granted. “We rely on the army. We didn’t rely on the sea. We didn’t think of the ocean. When we thought of the navy, it was just okay lah…We had forgotten that Indonesia is brought together due to the sea, due to UNCLOS”.

The Global Maritime Fulcrum (GMF) doctrine was launched by Indonesian President Joko Widodo in November 2014, to re-orient his country as an active player “in determining the future of the Pacific and Indian Ocean region (PACINDO)”.

He said that the GMF’s ‘balancing’ with OBOR was to ensure that Indonesia remained non-aligned. “We would like to be independent. We are too big to be leaning one way or the other,” he said.

Incidentally, Pandjaitan is also the Indonesian president’s special envoy to to establish strategic cooperation with China. Following a visit to China in April, he issued a statement that five cooperation contracts worth $23.3 billion had been signed under the Belt and Road Initiative. These include two hydropower projects, one power plant and a steel smelter.

Indonesia had taken part in the flagship OBOR summit hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing last year and proposed projects worth $28 billion.

Earlier this month, Chinese premier Li Keqiang visited Indonesia and signed a number of agreements, including hydropower projects. China is Indonesia’s third largest foreign investor.

“The two sides are pleased to witness the increasing infrastructure connectivity development cooperation in recent years reflected by the ongoing construction of the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Railway Project and the discussion on the planned joint development of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor within the Belt and Road Initiative cooperation and the Global Maritime Fulcrum framework. Both sides are determined to step up efforts to push forward the success of said projects,” said the Indonesian-Chinese joint statement.

Li also agreed to increase palm oil imports from Indonesia by over 500,000 tonnes per year. The export of palm oil was an area where New Delhi had an advantage over Beijing, as New Delhi is the largest exporter of Indonesian palm oil, followed by the EU and China.

However, India had increased the levies and duties on palm oil in November last year. This was raised by the Widodo during his visit to India in January 2017. The Indian side had asked Indonesia to revert if there was any drop in trade. Till now, Indian demand for palm oil has been increasing. However, an Indonesian official explained that this was largely due to the Indian festive season.

Pandjaitan underlined the political importance of palm oil exports, stating that it is necessary to reduce poverty, which is a priority for the Indonesian government.

Has Health Truly Become a Political Priority in India?,https://m.thewire.in/article/health/elections-2019-health-political-priority,"Apr 12, 2019  |  Chandrakant Lahariya","German physician, anthropologist, writer and politician Rudolf Virchow famously said, “Medicine is a social science, and politics nothing but medicine at a larger scale”. In democracies such as India, it is time for medicine at a large scale – that is, the political leadership – to ensure a healthy population.

In late 2018 and early 2019, a few people and experts in India started arguing that health has become a political priority and agenda for both state and Union governments. Most often, the argument is made based on the higher than usual coverage of health issues in the media, the high-pitched discussion on the Ayushman Bharat scheme, inclusion of health in select speeches of key leaders of political parties as well as social media posts on health issues.

However, a nuanced and closer examination would indicate that this increase might very well be due to publicity around the Ayushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, a higher social media penetration and presence as well as the wider availability of electronic media.

There is an information excess. Some of the new channels – which were not available until about a decade ago – are exclusively dedicated to social sector issues such as health, education, improved sanitation and nutrition. Though these are welcome developments, any inference that the wider visibility of health equals political priority might be a bit of a stretch.

Another reason for this inference is political announcements. In the run-up to the 2019 general elections, the ruling party talked about proposals in the National Health Policy 2017 and Ayushman Bharat to woo voters.

So we are now getting to hear more about health, it is more likely due to our increased access to information through multiple sources rather than it is being a higher political priority.

What are the manifestos promising on health?

For the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP manifesto’s health section is elegantly titled ‘Health for All’. However, the content is very input-centric, focused on what is already being done. Even if all that is promised is achieved, it is unlikely to vastly improve health outcomes.

On the other hand, Congress, the leading national party in opposition, has promised to enact The Right to Healthcare Act, increase government spending on health to 3% of the gross domestic product and rapidly increase the availability of human resources at government health facilities if elected to power.

However, rosy pre-election promises are not out of the ordinary at both the national and state level. Even during the last general elections, India’s two leading political parties had ‘health’ appearing a total of 125 times in their manifestoes. During most elections, health finds a customary section in party documents and promises. Top political leaders, time and again repeat that health would be their government’s priority. However, the situation on the ground rarely changes.

Also read: On Health, BJP Manifesto Replugs Existing Schemes But Is Vague on Other Plans

In the last few weeks, two pre-poll surveys on voter preference on election issues (ADR and Lokniti CSDS) have been released. While in one of these, health has been ranked amongst the top two priorities, in the other, health was not even listed. Apparently, this is related to methodology as the first one had health as explicitly listed as an issue to be prioritised by them. However, the second survey was seeking responses from voters without providing options. Possibly, health is not on the agenda unless people are reminded about it.

The key fallacy in interpreting most of these discourses is that the promises and policy announcements are considered as an end in itself. However, to make a difference in health outcomes, these need to be followed by implementation in the form of programmes and interventions.

Policies and strategies are confused with interventions and programme implementation. Similarly, the incremental changes in health interventions cannot be interpreted as a political priority.

Making pre-poll promises a reality

Health in India can be considered a political priority only when pre-poll promises are followed through and sustained in the post-poll period, supported by sufficient financial allocation, improved provision of human resources and ensuring availability of health services.

The launch of mohalla clinics of Delhi is an example of making health a political priority at the state level. In this case, a pre-election promise of ‘Mohalla Clinics’, was followed by sustained top-level leadership, sufficient financial and other allocation, which has been retained over the last 3-4 years.

The attention has resulted in the strengthening of primary healthcare, and many other reforms in health services which have become available, accessible and affordable to additional people.

Global scenario

There is sufficient global evidence that the countries that are doing well on health outcomes and have better-functioning government health system had the political will and commitment to do so.

This is true for the UK, Canada, Germany and Thailand, to list a few. In these settings, the governments identified the challenges, increased the spending on health and took all the necessary measures to ensure their citizens stay healthy.

Also read: Congress Manifesto Downgrades BJP’s Ayushman Bharat Health Insurance

In most of these settings, the political leadership across party lines competed to ensure good health for people and electoral change influenced health outcomes for the better.

In short, making health a political priority in these settings meant the identification of severity of health challenges and allocation of commensurate funding, human resources and infrastructure to tackle the challenges. This health situation in India mandates immediate attention and should be given a high priority.

That can be possible only when government-led health service delivery and stronger health systems become an integral part of campaigning during elections at all levels.

It is possible only when health – along with clean air, nutrition, education, sanitation and social security – becomes a factor based on which people vote.

"India, Nepal Sign Eight Pacts, Call for Closer Security and Defence Ties",https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-nepal-security-defence,"Aug 25, 2017  |  PTI","New Delhi: Nepal today assured India it would not allow any activity against its “friendly neighbour”, as the two sides signed eight pacts, including on cooperation in countering drug trafficking and post-earthquake reconstruction in the Himalayan nation.

After comprehensive talks with his Nepalese counterpart Sher Bahadur Deuba, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid emphasis on closer cooperation between the two countries security and defence forces to prevent the misuse of the open border between India and Nepal.

“Defence ties and assistance in security is an important aspect of our partnership. Our defence interests are also dependent on and connected to each other,” Modi said at a joint press briefing after the talks.

Deuba assured India of “every support, every help and cooperation”.

“As you [Modi] mentioned that Nepal has an open border… I would like to assure you that Nepal will never allow any activity against friendly neighbour India and there will be every support, every help and cooperation from our side,” Deuba said.

Acknowledging that there were “issues” in the implementation of Nepal’s constitution, he expressed confidence that it would encompass views of the people from all sections and ethnicities.

Modi, too, exuded confidence that Nepal would take into consideration the aspirations of all its citizens during the implementation of the constitution.

On August 21, the Nepalese parliament failed to endorse the much-awaited constitution amendment bill to address the issues of the Madhesi people as the ruling coalition could not garner the two-thirds majority required for its passage.

Deuba said both sides also exchanged views on regional and sub-regional cooperation using BIMSTEC (The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) and BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal Initiative) and create a “win-win” situation in various areas.

Modi hoped the consensus on various issues during the talks between the two sides would add “new energy” to bilateral relations.

The Nepalese prime minister said regular engagement at the highest political level would greatly contribute to sustaining and cementing trust between the two countries and his current visit was an effort towards it.

Holding that Nepal was “not only a neighbour, but also a good friend of India”, Deuba said its relation with India stood on a solid foundation.

“On the one hand, it is the rich civilisation, socio-cultural and economic linkages, and, on the other hand, it is commitment by the two countries to a time-tested principle of sovereign equality, peaceful co-existence and respect for each others sensitivity and aspirations,” Deuba said.

He further stated he appreciated Prime Minister Modis neighbourhood first policy and the approach of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’. “We are eager to see that this policy is translated into concrete and development activities,” he said.

The two sides, Deuba said, expressed satisfaction on the working of the eminent persons group on Nepal-India Relations (EPG-NIR).

He added both the countries were hopeful the EPG would complete the work within the defined time frame and submit practical recommendation, including a review of past treaties.

The EPG-NIR, a joint mechanism of Nepal and India, was set up in February last year to give necessary suggestions to update all existing bilateral treaties and agreements.

The two leaders jointly inaugurated the Kataiya-Kusaha and Raxaul-Parwanipur cross border power transmission lines. Modi said this would give an additional 100 MW of power to Nepal, apart from the existing 350 MW.

The two sides, Modi added, also agreed on development of the Ramayana and Buddhist tourism circuits through better connectivity.

Modi emphasised on cooperation with Nepal in economic relations, energy, water resources and connectivity projects.

The talks also focused on flood management and irrigation projects.

Modi stressed the need for greater coordination and consultation between the agencies of India and Nepal on flood management and said the two sides had to work towards a long term solution, taking into consideration each others interests.

He also reiterated Indias help in every possible way to flood-hit Nepal and said New Delhi was “committed” to partnering in Nepals development.

Deuba expressed the hope the detailed project report for the Pancheshwar project on the Uttarkhand border would be finalised soon, stressing that it would help in flood control and crop irrigation.

Modi said Deuba had informed him that land acquisition issues for Arun III irrigation project on the Arun river had been addressed and the Nepalese prime minister had invited him for the groundbreaking ceremony.

“Hydropower is a priority and has huge potential of cooperation. Both government would facilitate the early start of work on the two hydro-power projects,” Deuba said.

The Nepalese prime minister also expressed satisfaction on an MoU related to the construction of a wider Mechi bridge.

“We have likewise agreed to expedite work on the bridge on river Mahakali, integrated check posts and other developmental projects,” Deuba added."
Risky Medicine: Why FDI in India's Generic Drugs Industry Could be a Bad Idea,https://m.thewire.in/article/economy/domestic-global-risks-eased-direct-foreign-investments-indias-generics-industry,"Jul 20, 2016  |  Brook K. Baker","India needs a domestic pharmaceutical industry that is unfettered by foreign dominion and control, particularly by a rapacious multinational industry that so consistently prioritises supra profits for its executives.

On June 20, India announced a decision to allow increased foreign ownership of India’s domestic pharmaceutical companies without any government review. Previously, foreign entities could not acquire ownership interests in excess of 49% without government oversight, leaving a least some degree of majority control of company policy in the hands of local owners. Under the new government FDI policy, foreign pharmaceutical giants can acquire up to 74% ownership without any form of government review and can acquire ownership shares above that percentage – up to 100% – with only cursory review by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).

India has had a contested and evolving policy of allowing, indeed promoting direct foreign investment in its pharmaceutical sector. For the past several years it has had a total green light policy concerning investments in new pharmaceutical manufacturing plants by foreign companies, so-called “greenfield” investments. India’s policy with respect to “brownfield” FDI – acquisitions and mergers with local generic companies – has been more cautious on paper, but largely permissive in practice. Starting in 2011 after a spate of generic sell-offs to Big Pharma companies, India required government pre-approval of any degree of brownfield investment by the above-mentioned FIPB and the Competition Commission. Starting in 2013, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion eased sub-majority buy-in of domestic pharmaceuticals by granting automatic approvals of FDI investment resulting in 49% or less foreign ownership. Now the Centre has further “liberalised” the sector by automatically allowing up to 74% foreign ownership without any review of anti-competitive or health impacts.

FDI in the pharmaceutical sector has been promoted on a series of false promises of increased biomedical and pharmaceutical research and development, including on so-called neglected and tropical diseases that disproportionately affect India and other low and middle-income countries. Investments in new plants were also deemed to facilitate transfer and adoption of new technologies within India, increasingly its specialised capacity to manufacture medicines cost effectively and in turn to spur further incremental innovations and technical prowess. Contrary to these projections, recent studies find almost no new R&D investments and further find very little evidence of any meaningful technology transfer.

The risks of foreign ownership and control in India’s vibrant generic pharmaceutical industry are real. Many of these risks were reviewed in the Parliament of India’s 2013 report on FDI in the pharmaceutical sector. These risks include:

Killing the competition

India’s generic industry has been a thorn in the side of Big Pharma since the 1980s. With growing proportions of middle-class patients in India and other so-called pharmerging countries, European, US, and Japanese companies see generic producers eroding their monopoly profits domestically and abroad not only when patents expire but when generics successfully challenge or invalidate weak patents. Generics also promote country adoption and protection of stringent standards of patentability, like section 3(d) of India’s Amended Patents Act, they file and win pre- and post-grant opposition procedures, and they pursue or accept compulsory and government use licensing. Recently, generic producer even make superior products as when they make rational fixed-dose combination medicines that Big Pharma won’t make, as they did for HIV medicines and now are doing for hepatitis C medicines. In other words, generics are fearsome competitors, and if Big Pharma can buy them out and thereby gain unfettered access to monopoly profits, they will do so.

Rich country focus

Reprioritisation of India generics from focusing on India’s and other developing countries’ health needs and refocusing on the Big Pharma prime markets addressing life-style diseases in rich countries. India’s well-honed and efficient pharmaceutical capacity could be diverted from producing large volumes of assured quality generic medicines for diseases prevalent in low- and middle-income countries to more expensive branded products subject to patent monopolies in rich countries and sold at exorbitant prices in select markets. To some extent, this risk is already being realised through contract manufacturing and export of brand name products, but the trend could accelerate through majority or total acquisition of US-FDA approval Indian plants.

Price increase

With increased concentration of Big Pharma companies in its domestic market, India faces the risk of sustained increases in drug prices, even on “Indian” generic medicines. Pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. routinely increase drug prices annually, far above the rate of inflation. Any belief that Big Pharma companies will gladly accept price controls is pure fantasy.

IP policy influence

With increased clout in the domestic pharmaceutical industry and in pursuit of its own self-interest in the Indian and export markets, foreign controlled pharmaceuticals can be expected to pursue policies undermining India’s commitment to the full use of public health safeguards in its patent law that encourage competition to lower medicine prices . Pharma will lobby for government adoption of measures that go well beyond the World Trade Organisation’s rules on intellectual property including lowered patent standards, formalisation of the moratorium on compulsory licenses, patent term extensions, and new registration-related monopolies including data exclusivity and linking marketing approval of medicines to their patent status.

Left to its own, with a full set of enabling policies, the Indian generics industry is well positioned to serve both domestic and global health needs. It focuses intensely on manufacturing efficiencies and meeting global quality standards. It is increasingly focusing on incremental innovations and improved formulations better suited to the needs of low- and middle-income countries. In the longer term, it is hoped that Indian generics will develop increased capacity to focus research and development activities on diseases that disproportionately affect Indian patients. Although 55% of generic production is exported, Indian generics are fully capable of meeting the medicines needs of Indian patients once the government and employers commit more fully to fulfilling the right to health. India companies are also positioned to share their expertise and capacity with partners in other countries, especially least developed countries like Bangladesh, which will be free of patent barriers for at least 17 years on pharmaceutical products. Finally, the generics industry is ready and able to become compulsory licensees on overpriced cancer and other medicines for the government, on their own behalf, and for export to countries with insufficient local manufacturing capacity.

India needs a domestic pharmaceutical industry that is unfettered by foreign dominion and control, particularly by a rapacious multinational industry that so consistently prioritises supra profits for its executives and shareholders over the lives, health, and well-being of Indian and global populations. For at least the past 15 years, India has been the pharmacy of the poor and it has steadily concentrated its efforts on securing fair returns to its investors while simultaneously large volumes of affordable generic medicines at affordable prices. India should not open its door to an influx of pharmaceutical giants that want discount access to the high quality pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity that India has worked so hard and so successfully to develop. Let’s keep “Made in India” medicines Indian.

"'Muslims Could Flee India,' Says Imran Khan; 'Familiar Falsehoods,' Says New Delhi",https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/india-pakistan-citizenship-act,"Dec 18, 2019  |  PTI","New Delhi: India on Tuesday dismissed as “falsehoods” Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s comments at a global refugee conference that millions of Muslims could flee India due to “clampdown” in Kashmir and enactment of the amended citizenship law.

In a sharp reaction, external affairs ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said Khan has once again “peddled familiar falsehoods” at a multilateral platform to advance his “narrow” political agenda by making gratuitous and unwarranted remarks on matters entirely internal to India.

In his address at the Global Refugee Forum (GRF) in Geneva, Khan came down hard on India for scrapping special status of Jammu and Kashmir as well as on the amended citizenship law.

“It should now be clear to the entire world that this is an established pattern of his (Khan) habitual and compulsive abuse of global forums,” the MEA spokesperson said.

“It has been the unfortunate experience of most of Pakistan’s neighbours that actions by that country have had adverse consequences next door,” he added.

The Global Refugee Forum — the first major meeting on refugees of the 21st century — was jointly hosted by the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency and the government of Switzerland.

Rejecting Khan’s criticism of the citizenship law, Kumar said, “Over the past 72 years, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has systematically persecuted all of its minorities, forcing most of them to flee to India.”

“Moreover, Prime Minister Khan wishes the world forgets what his Army did in 1971 to the people of the erstwhile East Pakistan. Pakistan must act to protect and promote the rights of its own minorities and co-religionists,” the MEA spokesperson said.

The Citizenship Amendment Act seeks to provide citizenship to non-Muslim religious minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who arrived in India till December 31, 2014 to escape religious persecution."
"Denied Indian Visa, Shahidul Alam Attends Delhi Event Via Skype",https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/bangladeshi-photographer-shahidul-alam-denied-visa,"Sep 14, 2019  |  Anoo Bhuyan","New Delhi: From a waiting room at London’s Heathrow airport, with children’s toys scattered all around him, a cheery Shahidul Alam addressed an event at the city’s British Council via Skype.

This was not the medium through which Alam had planned on addressing the audience.

Alam was to have spoken on the relationship between politics and art in person. But for reasons unknown, he was denied a visa to India.

So he improvised with what he could. He addressed the audience via Skype and took questions via WhatsApp.

All this work-around meant that the 2018 Facebook post he had made was still alive in the memories of authorities.

A Bangladeshi photographer, Alam had been jailed for over 100 days last year by the country’s government, over a Facebook post in which he had been critical of the state. The 63-year-old was TIME magazine’s ‘person of the year’ for 2018. The magazine said he had gone from “photographer to prisoner.”

Over a connection which cracked often, Alam addressed the packed hall, talking about his work and going through a slide-show of some of his photographs, which were projected on the screen. There was one photo he took of a group of Rohingya people. He also showed an image from an exhibition about Kalpana Chakma, a woman who went missing in 1996, and was apparently abducted by the army.

Alam also spoke about his time in jail in Bangladesh. “I used that time productively. I convinced the wardens to let us paint. The various prisoners and I made 33 murals. There is a gallery now in that jail.”

He then displayed a photo of a boat, which also inspired a mural that was painted by those in prison with him. “This is by far the photo I am most proud of,” said Alam.

He also spoke about how tough it has been to find galleries to exhibit the art of people like him and described an incident from many years ago when he wondered if he could hold an exhibition in a mosque. He said he had looked into history and seen that mosques had been used for versatile purposes. Alam managed to convince the heads of one mosque and organised an art exhibition there. “People of all religions and sexualities came,” he said.

Shohini Ghosh, the event’s moderator, said that the fact that Alam used spaces like jails and mosques for art meant that there are spaces still available and spaces still left to conquer for the arts. Ghosh is a professor at Jamia Millia Islamia University.

By then, the audio was choppy for Alam, so conversation moved to WhatsApp, on which Alam took a question from this reporters as well: Has his unique situation impinged on his art, does his art profit from this?

Alam replied that his life has changed dramatically since he was imprisoned and then released. “A woman came up to me with a child and asked me to bless him. She said she wanted him to grow up to be like me. I found it very powerful. We think we should keep our head down but there are people wanting to revolt.”

“I should thank the Bangladesh government,” he added.

Before the controversy, he said, some people abroad and some from Bangladesh’s creative circles knew him for his work. After his release, the equation changed. People on the streets sometimes hugged him with tears in their eyes, saying that his case had touched their lives.

The controversy has also been challenging, because while previously he would bicycle or walk to meet people, talk with and photograph them, now Alam says he doesn’t travel alone and is constantly reporting back home.

“We need to ensure our governments don’t get away with keeping us all separate,” he said, ending his presentation.

Replying to subsequent emails from The Wire, Alam said he did not know why his visa was denied and he was not given an explanation. “I can only surmise. Several other prominent citizens have been denied visas. All of them have been critical of the Indian government.”

He recalled that in the early 2000s too, he had been “consistently” denied an Indian visa for many years. This was after he exhibited work done by children born in Sonagachhi, Kolkata’s red-light district.

Alam would now catch the connecting flight from London to Germany where he will work. Next, he will attend the UN General Assembly in New York. He had planned to make a quick stop in Delhi for this talk, but the plan had to be scuttled over the visa denial.

The panel discussion in Delhi today was part of a day-long series of talks by the Serendipity Arts Festival and Alkazi Foundation. Alam was on a panel titled, ‘Political Dimensions of (Arts) Practices.’ The other panelists were Shohini Ghosh, Ashmina Ranjit and Sudhanva Deshpande.

Why was Shahidul Alam in jail?

Last year, Alam live-streamed a video on Facebook where he spoke about student protests in Dhaka and about how he alleged he was attacked by members of the ruling party when he attended the protests. He said they broke his camera while he was filming the protests. He had also spoken to Al-Jazeera around that time, speaking critically of the government.

The student protests had been over the demand for safer roads after two young people were killed in a road accident last July.

Alam was arrested on the allegation of spreading “propaganda and false information”.

In November 2018, Alam was granted permanent bail in Bangaldesh after 102 days in custody. Last month, Bangladesh’s Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s stay order on further probes by the government against the photographer.

Alam is an award winning photographer, journalist, curator, teacher and activist. Many famous organisations and personalities lent their support to Alam’s release including Amnesty International, International Federation of Journalists and several Indian photographers, filmmakers, artists and journalists.

“Had there been any evidence, it would have been in the public domain. Yet, over a year after my arrest, torture and period in jail, the prosecution has not even been able to frame charges. I salute the judiciary for their independent decision. They are the one of the few hopes that Bangladesh has left,” Alam had told The Wire, after the court ruling."
Mumbai Indians Dominate Chennai Super Kings to Take Second IPL Title,https://m.thewire.in/article/sport/mumbai-indians-dominate-chennai-super-kings-to-take-second-ipl-title,"May 25, 2015  |  PTI","Kolkata: Mumbai Indians’ love affair with Eden Gardens continued as they clinched their second IPL title following a crushing 41-run win over Chennai Super Kings in a lopsided summit clash, here on Sunday night.

Mumbai Indians posted an imposing 202 for five as skipper Rohit Sharma (50) and Lendl Simmons (68) rattled up a 119-run stand off from just 67 balls after being invited to bat.

The Mumbai captain, who has an ODI world record of 264 and also a debut Test hundred at the Eden Gardens, yet again exploded at his favourite venue.

Sharma (6 fours, 2 sixes) and Simmons (8 fours, 3 sixes) plundered 19 boundaries in their partnership.

After Sharma and Simmons’s dismissals in consecutive balls, burly West Indies batsman Kieron Pollard (36), in the company of Ambati Rayudu (36 not out), led the side past 200.

Mumbai’s bowlers complimented the good work of their batsmen as they took the fizz out of Chennai’s chase with a very disciplined effort.

They straitjacketed the Chennai batsmen, restricting them to 161 for eight as seasoned spinner Harbhajan Singh took the key wickets of Dwayne Smith (57) and Suresh Raina (28) in two overs.

Kiwi paceman Mitchell McClenaghan took three wickets for 25 runs while his Lankan pace colleague Lasith Malinga scalped two batsmen, also at the cost of 25.

Mumbai had won their first title in 2013 at this very venue, defeating the same rivals. Chennai have now lost four finals (2008, 2012, 2013 and 2015) in six appearances.

Chasing the huge target, CSK opted to have it easy and concentrated on building a platform after losing Michael Hussey (4) early.

Smith and Raina bided their time and looked to consolidate but it meant that they managed only 31 runs from the first six overs. The required run-rate kept climbing and shot past 13 at the halfway mark.

Smith completed his half-century in 45 balls only to be trapped lbw by Harbhajan in his penultimate over. Having made a grand comeback into the Bangladesh-bound test side, he completed his spell in style by dismissing Raina.

Looking to step out, Raina was brilliantly deceived by the veteran off-spinner, who bowled a wide ball, and Parthiv Patel did the rest behind the stumps.

With Hussey, Smith and Raina back in the pavilion, and skipper Dhoni not looking in his usual elements, it looked as good as over for the yellow brigade, who choked in an IPL final for the fourth time."
A Tribute To Saumitra Chaudhuri,https://m.thewire.in/article/uncategorised/a-tribute-to-saumitra-chaudhuri,"Dec 20, 2016  |  C. Rangarajan","A renowned economist, he had a deep understanding of the working of the Indian financial system and was an expert on the Chinese economy.

In the passing away of Saumitra Chaudhuri, India has lost an eminent economist. He was a highly valued colleague of mine in the Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister. He played a key role in the drafting of the Annual Outlook of the Economy which the council submitted to the prime minister and the nation.

Intellectually sharp, he was gifted with the ability to provide answers to thorny problems. He saw himself as an applied economist. His domain of interest in economics was wide, ranging from real sector issues to monetary, fiscal and trade policies. He had a deep understanding of the working of the Indian financial system and the corporate sector. He had outlined in many places how the corporate sector responded to liberalisation in terms of efficiency. He tracked carefully the developments of the rest of the world and their impact on the Indian economy. His frequent visits to China made him an expert on the Chinese economy. It is difficult to find another economist with such a comprehensive reach.

Any picture of Saumitra will not be complete without a reference to his attachment of data. His laptop was a treasure house of information. He knew the sources of data and the methodology used for collection and computation. In essence, he knew the merits and limitations of the data we use. He worked with me in several areas of data credibility. He chaired the committee to revise the Index of Industrial Production. The implementation of his recommendations will enhance the usefulness of this important set of data which has come in for severe criticism in recent years.

It Is Time for India to Stop Blaming China for Blocking Its NSG Bid,https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/it-is-time-for-india-to-stop-blaming-china-for-blocking-its-nsg-bid,"Nov 08, 2016  |  Jabin T. Jacob","Resentment against China has continued for far too long and gone too far. By focusing on just one issue in its ties with China, India risks having the world perceive its interests as monochromatic and emotional rather than based on realism and strategic foresight.

Even as India’s application to become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is due to be reconsidered at a consultative meeting in Vienna later this month, questions over China’s response still remain unanswered.

According to the external affairs ministry, India’s argument for pursuing NSG membership is that being a member “would place our existing cooperation on a predictable basis and facilitate the enhanced investments, industrial tie-ups and technology access required to accelerate augmentation of nuclear power capacity in India”.

Additionally, public opinion seems to have settled on one aspect of India’s application – that China is the only country that stands between India and its aspirations. It is almost as if New Delhi has resigned itself to failure. After all, what realist would believe that Beijing would shoot itself in the foot by not only acknowledging India’s global role as a responsible nuclear power but also letting down its own ally, Pakistan, by accepting India’s application to the NSG? And so, it appears that New Delhi’s one goal is ensuring that India is perceived as standing up to China – and bad-mouthing Beijing seems to be a big part of this strategy.

Clearly, it is a bit disingenuous of the Indian government and many analysts to blame China alone for opposing India’s entry. Earlier this year, in the run-up to the NSG’s annual plenary meeting in Seoul, minister of state for external affairs V.K. Singh addressed parliament regarding India’s efforts to join the NSG and appeared to have chosen his words carefully. Talking about international support for India, he used such expressions as “[a]n overwhelming number”, “[t]he broad sentiment within the NSG” and “a very large measure“. Notably, Singh did not say, “all minus one”. There is no doubt that China was not on board with India’s membership, but there are also other countries that are not fully convinced. Thus, Singh’s statement offered a wider picture of India’s diplomatic efforts to push its application forward – the Indian government’s efforts were clearly not concentrated to China but spread out amongst all NSG members, including New Zealand, whose prime minister recently visited India but notably did not express unequivocal support for India’s application.

It is unclear who the Indian government is trying to please by painting China in a bad light and as the only obstacle to India’s NSG membership.

If the intended audience is domestic then surely there is no need to exert such effort to generate prejudice against China, given that it already exists.

When it comes to popular rhetoric, critiquing China for tutoring and subsidising Pakistan in the ways of the atom is understandable. Especially in the wake of the Uri attacks and India’s limited options for retaliating against Pakistan, given that both countries are nuclear powers. However, Indian analysts and government officials – all realists, one presumes – know full well that the NSG is the stuff of international politics.

So how does this domestic grandstanding help India’s quest for NSG membership? It doesn’t.

Alternatively, if the intended audience is international, including the Chinese, then India must reconsider its approach.

How China games international law

Unlike 2008, when India won its NSG waiver and China tried to ensure that it was not perceived as the final obstacle in India’s way, today Beijing has no such qualms about international perception. To begin with, US-China relations are currently going through a particularly bad phase and for a number of reasons, including focusing on other regions, this time around Washington is unwilling to work on the issue with Beijing like it did the first time round in Vienna.

What’s more, Beijing’s current leadership may decide to block India’s NSG bid for an even longer amount of time if it believes that New Delhi is obviously targeting China or playing the American card.

China may block India’s bid by using what critics might call the ‘fig leaf’ of international law – that India has not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Yes, China has ignored international law in the South China Sea and yes, it is being hypocritical when it demands India sign the NPT as a condition for entry to the NSG, but India would do well to understand how the Chinese leadership understands and uses international law.

Clearly, there is the Athenian ‘the-strong-do-what-they-can’ approach when it comes to international law, but there is also a savvier, backroom approach that can be employed. Case in point – in October, China persuaded the Philippines into temporarily setting aside the July ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) on the South China Sea even though it was in its own favour. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s visit to China saw him meet four members of China’s seven-member Politburo Standing Committee – unusual for any visiting foreign dignitary – and sign several billion dollars worth of trade deals and additional talk of undertaking a joint exploration for gas and oil in the South China Sea. In other words, the Athenians got the Melians to submit and pay tribute despite justice being on the latter’s side.

India’s options

India must learn from the Sino-Filipino case. One, India cannot expect its ‘morally just’ position to win just because it is so. It will need to work hard on the other NSG members to convince them to not just support India but also stand up to Chinese opposition.

Two, the US needs to be persuaded to put more skin in the game. In the case of the dispute with the Philippines, China’s confidence came from its assessment like that of the Athenians in Thucydides’ tale, that Melos’ ally was not inclined to risk blood and treasure for the latter’s cause.

Three, India must seek to persuade China that it is advantageous to back India. The continuing hostility between the two countries and the slow pace of movement that Chinese investors sense in India need to be addressed. Without some visible progress that Chinese state-owned enterprises, including provincial government investors, can highlight in India, the central government in Beijing will find little incentive to consider letting go of its opposition to India’s NSG application as well as other issues.

Following the PCA’s South China Sea ruling, China has demonstrated that the way to bounce back from a diplomatic loss is employing more diplomacy – political, economic and military.

The current attitude of surliness and resentment against China, exhibited by Indian civilians as well as government officials, has now continued for far too long and has gone too far. Case in point being the absurd call to boycott Chinese goods.

Aspiring great powers learn to live and deal with other great powers. They learn the importance of keeping multiple lines of engagement open. By focusing on just one issue in its relations with China, India risks having the world perceive its interests as monochromatic and emotional rather than based on realism and strategic foresight.

"BJP Disrupts Parliament Proceedings Over Rahul's 'Rape' Remark, Demands Apology",https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/bjp-disrupts-parliament-proceedings-over-rahuls-rape-remark-demands-apology,"Dec 14, 2019  |  PTI","New Delhi: The BJP on Friday launched a no-holds-barred attack, both inside and outside parliament, against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his rape remarks and demanded an apology from Gandhi, who refused to do so, and instead asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to tender an apology for calling Delhi a “rape capital” under the UPA government.

The BJP disrupted proceedings in Rajya Sabha as well as in Lok Sabha, where the party protest, led by party’s women MPs who assembled together just near the Well to attack Gandhi, derailed the scheduled business and forced Speaker Om Birla to adjourn the proceedings twice on the last day of the Winter Session.

Sticking to his guns, Gandhi told reporters outside Parliament, “as far as their (BJP’s) demand for apologising (is concerned), I am never going to apologise to them.”

The Congress leader also said he has a video clip of Narendra Modi in his phone in which he is seen calling Delhi the ‘rape capital’ which he will post on Twitter for the whole country to see, and demanded Modi should apologise.

Modi should apologise. 1. For burning the North East. 2. For destroying India’s economy. 3. For this speech, a clip of which I’m attaching. pic.twitter.com/KgPU8dpmrE — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) December 13, 2019



Later, Union minister Smriti Irani, who also led the attack against Gandhi in Lok Sabha, along with other BJP women parliamentarians petitioned the Election Commission demanding “severest action possible” against him, alleging that he has used rape incidents as a “political tool” to settle scores with Prime Minister Modi.

Under the BJP’s vociferous attack, the Congress leader alleged that the issue was being blown up only to divert the attention of the public from the country-wide protests over the Citizenship Amendment law.

Referring to his Jharkhand speech, Gandhi asserted “I had said that Narendra Modi had talked about ‘Make in India’ and we thought we would see ‘Make in India’ in all the newspapers. But, when we read newspapers we only see ‘rape in India’ everywhere. There is no BJP-ruled state where rapes are not happening against women. In Unnao, a BJP MLA committed rape against a woman, and also got an accident done of the victim’s car, but Narendra Modi did not utter a single word and neither took any action.”

“What has happened is that Narendra Modi makes use of violence and spreads it and today there is violence in the entire country. there is violence against women, there is violence in the North East and in Kashmir, and there is violence in the entire country,” he further alleged.

He said the main issue today is that “the BJP, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have burnt the entire North East and this is a tactic used to divert attention” by raising his rape remarks.

“Modi should apologise. For burning the North East. For destroying India’s economy. For this speech, a clip of which I’m attaching,” Gandhi later tweeted.

Gandhi also said India’s biggest strength was its economy and claimed that Raghuram Rajan (former RBI governor) during a meeting told him that no one talks about India or Indian economy any longer in the US or Europe.

“And, when India is talked about it is about atrocities, division and violence. They have ruined the entire reputation of our country and this is what I talked about in my speech yesterday,” he said.

Gandhi’s ‘rape in India’ barb at the Modi government triggered furious reactions from senior BJP leaders and Union ministers, including Rajnath Singh who said leaders like him have no “moral right” to be in Parliament.

Singh said the Modi government had started ‘Make in India’ programme to transform India from an importing nation into an exporting one.

It is aimed at providing employment to youth in the country but people are now rhyming it with remarks which cannot be uttered, Singh added.

Irani said he had “insulted” the women and men of India and claimed his remarks amounted to inviting people to rape women.

Amid the din in the House, DMK’s Kanimozhi defended Gandhi as Congress members also got up from their seats in protest and asked the Speaker to take up the Question Hour.

She said Gandhi did not make the remarks in the House and that he was referring to cases of sexual assaults and violence against women in the country.

Kanimozhi’s reaction came after Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi asked her and NCP leader Supriya Sule to express their opinion about Gandhi’s remarks.

Joshi termed her response “unfortunate”.

The protests began as soon as the House assembled. After the House paid tributes to those who had lost their lives in the 2001 Parliament attack on this day, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal said several BJP members had given notices of adjournment on the issue and they should be allowed to speak.

BJP MP Locket Chatterjee said Gandhi had insulted not only women of the country but everyone. All men are not rapists, she said.

After submitting the petition with the ECI, Irani told reporters that,”it is with a sense of outrage” that women MPs of BJP have approached the Commission.

“We have beseeched the Commission that it is for the first time that a political leader has used rape for political mockery. The entire nation looks upon this constitutional authority (EC) to ensure that dignity of women is upheld and those politicians who seek to use rape as a political weapon are reprimanded with the severest punishment possible,” she said.

Irani said the EC officials have assured the delegation that they will do justice after following legal procedures. They also handed over a memorandum to the EC.

“Rahul Gandhi has grossly violated the letter and spirit of the Model Code of Conduct. He has inflicted irreparable hurt on the status of women in India,” the memorandum reads.

Assembly polls are being held in Jharkhand in five phases. The counting of votes will take place on December 23.

Congress’ Randeep Surjewala hit back at Irani saying she is not just a minister but also a woman and should answer to the charges against BJP leaders Kuldeep Sengar and Nityanand.

He also put out a video of Irani evading questions on the rape accused BJP leaders and said she should not vent out false anger against Gandhi, after inaction against their own rape accused leaders.

Other Union ministers who attacked Gandhi, included Nirmala Sitharaman and Nitin Gadkari.

While Gadkari dubbed Gandhi’s statement as “unfortunate” not just for the country and democracy, but for the Congress as well, Sitharaman said the remarks were “horrendous”.

What Should be India's Role in the Age of Global Chaos?,https://m.thewire.in/article/external-affairs/what-should-be-indias-role-in-the-age-of-global-chaos,"Apr 28, 2016  |  Prem Shankar Jha","The Modi government’s last minute decision to postpone the signature of a Logistics Supply Agreement with the US during the visit of US Defence secretary Ashton Carter to India last week is the most recent manifestation of the confusion that grips India’s foreign policy today .

The government has given no explanation for its sudden turnabout, so most analysts have concluded that it got cold feet because the agreement would have made India a party, even if passively, to all of the US’ future military operations in the region. This had aroused serious misgivings in the country and invited a vigorous attack by the Congress party.

But the fact that Defence minister Manohar Parrikar visited China only days after Carter’s visit to reassure Beijing that India would not let relations with ‘third countries’ affect its relations with China, suggests that it was a Chinese reminder that India could not run with the hare and hunt with the hounds indefinitely that may have provoked its second thoughts on signing the agreement.

It is doubtful whether the Chinese will be reassured though, for this is only the latest of a succession of about turns that Modi has made in the 22 months that he has been prime minister. In August 2014, he reversed a decade of steady improvement in relations with Pakistan by rejecting all the understandings that the UPA had reached with it and the Hurriyat over the future of Kashmir. Today, he is trying to rebuild those relations once again.

Six months ago, Modi reversed five decades of Indian support for Nepal’s evolution into a modern nation state by imposing, or at least doing nothing to prevent, an oil blockade of that landlocked state. Nepal’s riposte was to repudiate Indian bilateralism, formally welcome China into Nepal and join its One Belt One Road initiative.

But nothing is likely to prove more costly than its ambivalence towards China. Modi has spared no effort to deepen India’s relations with China. But he has simultaneously deepened India’s military cooperation with the US, Japan and Australia whose stated purpose is to contain China’s rise, militarily if necessary.

To Indian policy makers this may look like a clever balancing act but, coming on top of the UPA government’s gradual distancing of India from its old allies, such as Russia and secular nations in the Arab world, in favour of the US, the gulf sheikhdoms and Israel, it is giving the rest of the world the impression that India does not understand where its long term national interest lies, and is therefore a country that no one can rely upon.

China has already signaled its distrust of India’s moves by moving swiftly to Nepal’s aid, and blocking the designation of Masood Azhar as a terrorist by the UN. It seems also to have lost interest in getting India to join its One Belt, One Road initiative.

Two epic developments are responsible for these power shifts. The first is Globalization – the migration of manufacturing from the high wage economies of Europe and North America to Asia — that began in the 1970s. The second is the victory of the transatlantic alliance in the Cold war and breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Globalisation

Over four decades, gradual de-industrialisation has hollowed out the economic base of the West’s military power by shrinking its revenue base just when its social security expenditure has been pushed through the roof by longer life spans and rising unemployment.

In Asia the hectic industrial development triggered by globalisation has done the opposite. First Taiwan, then Singapore, Hongkong, South Korea and Malaysia , and finally and most spectacularly China, have run budget and foreign trade surpluses, and accumulated massive reserves of Capital that have become the base of huge economic power. China has been able to leverage these into growing military power and hegemonic influence.

Had the resulting power shift been gradual the world could have adjusted to it peacefully. But the economic weakening of the West virtually coincided with its victory in the Cold War. This created a sense of entitlement to the fruits of victory, that enabled the US to launch, or support, a succession of attacks on so called ‘rogue nations’, with scant regard for the UN charter or the sanction of the Security Council.

Goes back to Kosovo

Beginning with Kosovo in 1999, it has launched, or supported, a succession of assaults on nations that posed no threat to it or any of its allies–Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Yemen. Not one of these has created a democracy, protected human rights or promoted freedom. What they have done is to destroy the tenuous system of international law that upheld the Westphalian state system that the UN charter had underpinned.

American, and several Indian, analysts have made light of the destruction of the Westphalian state system. “The West’s victory in the cold war”, they say, “has created a unipolar world. We therefore need a new paradigm of international relations“.

This seemingly profound observation relies upon ignorance of history, to gain its spurious credibility. For the Westphalian system was created to put a check on precisely the propensity for conflict between nation states that has dragged the world into chaos today.

This propensity springs from fact that the modern European state was born in war and territorial conquest. Since the boundaries created by conquest did not coincide with ethnic fault lines they had to be continually defended. This was done by creating standing armies to defend them and erasing pre-existing ethnic loyalties to create a new loyalty to “the Nation”. The constant need for coercion to maintain it gave the nascent Nation-State System a built in propensity for war .

Like the League of Nations and the United Nations three centuries later, the Treaty of Westphalia, which was signed in 1648 after the ruinous Thirty Year War, was designed to prevent this from ever happening again. To this end the signatories agreed to respect each others’ sovereignty, not to interfere in each other’s internal affairs and to resort to war only as a weapon of last resort.

The Westphalian precepts were still taking root when the rise of industrial capitalism in the 18th century gave a fillip to the propensity for war by giving inter-State rivalry an economic dimension that it had lacked until then. Competitive industrialisation behind tariff barriers further hardened frontiers, and set off a race to colonize large parts of the world to ensure access to raw materials and create new markets for their products.

Despite this, peace was maintained for a hundred years after the Napoleonic wars by a tacit acceptance of British hegemony, backed by an international network of bankers who were perfectly willing to finance colonial expansion but demanded peace within Europe in return. Karl Polanyi collectively labelled them Haute Finance.

Unstable peace

But the peace these created was an unstable one. By the end of the 19th century Britain’s hegemony had begun to be challenged by Germany and the US. When the space for further expansion of nation-based capitalist systems was exhausted, competition boiled over again into not one but two world wars in a space of 31 years that claimed at least 70 million lives. Peace did not return till 1945 when hegemony within the capitalist system passed to the USA.

US hegemony was based upon the reputation it gained during the second world war as a defender of freedom , democracy and human rights, and cemented by its lead role in the framing of the UN Charter. But till 1991 its exercise of hegemony was constrained by the challenge of Communism and non-alignment. By the time these failed and the US was able to resume its quest for global hegemony, the Vietnam war and Globalization had sapped much of its economic strength.

Victory in the Cold War nevertheless re-awakened the US’ hegemonic ambitions just when, as Paul Wolfowitz noted in a Defence Policy Planning paper as early as 1987, the economic base needed to sustain them was shrinking. Wolfowitz’s solution, which soon became the mantra for both political parties in the US and was enshrined as a new security doctrine by President George W Bush in 2002, was to use military power pre-emptively to destroy potential rivals before they developed the capacity to challenge its supremacy.

This is the true genesis of the US’ cavalier disregard for the UN charter and its determination to build a hegemonic world order. What US policy makers, other than President Obama, have still not realized is that hegemony is not the same thing as military dominance, and the resort to the second inevitably destroys the first by making the lives of peoples and nations less and less secure.

A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, it is no longer possible to ignore the fact that the effort to re-establish western hegemony has created not a new world order but chaos. Both the Westphalian and the unipolar world order are history. What has survived is the mindset, of constant suspicion and barely restrained aggression that characterizes relations between nation-states. This mindset views any improvement in a neighbour’s capabilities as a potential threat to itself, and therefore reduces international relations to a zero sum game in which if you gain anything I must necessarily be losing something, even if I cannot identify what it is.

This is the mindset that must change if humanity is to survive and rebuild a peaceful, livable world. Today when the merest whiff of trouble makes foreign investors rush out of a country, starting a war with, or intervening clandestinely to secure regime change in, another country is an act of suicide.

The first requirement therefore must be to banish unilateral war and return to negotiation as the way to settle disputes. As Iran’s foreign minister Husain Jawad Zarif reminded an invited audience in Delhi in January 2015, this will only happen when negotiators eschew win-lose outcomes and start exploring bottom lines to find compromise solutions that leave both parties better off than before.

In his speech to West Point graduates in 2014 and, more concretely, in his dogged determination to push the Iran-EU nuclear deal through, President Obama has shown that he wants the US to eschew Bush’s pre-emptive first strike security doctrine and to abandon the pursuit of a unipolar world order in favour of a multi-polar order. But his term is ending and, as of now, even Hilary Clinton has said nothing that suggests that she understands the need for a radical change of direction. Until that happens, India will do well to steer clear of a closer involvement with it or its allies in the Middle East.

What the world needs now is not a new paradigm of international relations, but a powerful reaffirmation of the Westphalian paradigm with modifications to make it meet the needs of a culturally integrated world. So long as the West resists this, or tries only to broad-base its quest for uni-polarity by forming ‘coalitions of the willing’, it and its friends will remain on the wrong side of history.

Russia, Iran committed to multipolar world

By the same token today it is Russia, China and Iran that are on the right side of history, for it is they who are most committed to building a multipolar world. This is apparent from the popularity Russia and Iran have gained by going decisively to the assistance of Syria and Iraq in the fight against the Islamic State. For no fault of its own India found itself on the wrong side of history during the Cold War. It must not make the same mistake again.

But this does not mean that it should simply switch sides. The role that it is best fitted to play is that of a mediator that can moderate conflict and bring warring nations back to sanity. This is a leadership role of a different kind from what India aspires to today, but it is one that it is ideally situated to play. This is not only because it is vast, democratic and unthreatening even to its immediate neighbours, but because it is the only modern state that has not been built through conquest and ethnic homogenization, but through negotiation and accommodation of differences. It is therefore comfortable with compromise and does not have to overcome the zero-sum mentality embedded in European nation states by their history and circumstances of birth, before initiating the quest for peace.
