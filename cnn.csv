China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.

Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.

While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

 — 
India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.
Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

 — 
India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”
S&P 500 is in correction territory as huge market week looms

Stock futures are moving higher on Monday morning. The Dow lost 1.1% Friday to end the week at its lowest point since March, while the S&P 500 fell into a correction, marking a more than 10% drop from its most recent July peak.
CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, tipped into “extreme fear” on Monday morning as investors worry about lackluster third-quarter earnings, historically high bond yields, mixed economic data and conflict in the Middle East.
This will be another massive week for the economy and markets alike: the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, Apple reports earnings on Thursday and the October jobs report is due out on Friday."

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
ADVERTISING
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.
Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

 — 
India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”
S&P 500 is in correction territory as huge market week looms

Stock futures are moving higher on Monday morning. The Dow lost 1.1% Friday to end the week at its lowest point since March, while the S&P 500 fell into a correction, marking a more than 10% drop from its most recent July peak.
CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, tipped into “extreme fear” on Monday morning as investors worry about lackluster third-quarter earnings, historically high bond yields, mixed economic data and conflict in the Middle East.
This will be another massive week for the economy and markets alike: the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, Apple reports earnings on Thursday and the October jobs report is due out on Friday."

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.
Ad Feedback
Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.

Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

 — 
India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.
Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

 — 
India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”
S&P 500 is in correction territory as huge market week looms

Stock futures are moving higher on Monday morning. The Dow lost 1.1% Friday to end the week at its lowest point since March, while the S&P 500 fell into a correction, marking a more than 10% drop from its most recent July peak.
CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, tipped into “extreme fear” on Monday morning as investors worry about lackluster third-quarter earnings, historically high bond yields, mixed economic data and conflict in the Middle East.
This will be another massive week for the economy and markets alike: the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, Apple reports earnings on Thursday and the October jobs report is due out on Friday."

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.
Ad Feedback
Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”
S&P 500 is in correction territory as huge market week looms

Stock futures are moving higher on Monday morning. The Dow lost 1.1% Friday to end the week at its lowest point since March, while the S&P 500 fell into a correction, marking a more than 10% drop from its most recent July peak.
CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, tipped into “extreme fear” on Monday morning as investors worry about lackluster third-quarter earnings, historically high bond yields, mixed economic data and conflict in the Middle East.
This will be another massive week for the economy and markets alike: the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, Apple reports earnings on Thursday and the October jobs report is due out on Friday."

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.
Ad Feedback
Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”

The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown.

“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”
S&P 500 is in correction territory as huge market week looms

Stock futures are moving higher on Monday morning. The Dow lost 1.1% Friday to end the week at its lowest point since March, while the S&P 500 fell into a correction, marking a more than 10% drop from its most recent July peak.
CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, tipped into “extreme fear” on Monday morning as investors worry about lackluster third-quarter earnings, historically high bond yields, mixed economic data and conflict in the Middle East.
This will be another massive week for the economy and markets alike: the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, Apple reports earnings on Thursday and the October jobs report is due out on Friday."

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.
Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”
S&P 500 is in correction territory as huge market week looms

Stock futures are moving higher on Monday morning. The Dow lost 1.1% Friday to end the week at its lowest point since March, while the S&P 500 fell into a correction, marking a more than 10% drop from its most recent July peak.
CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, tipped into “extreme fear” on Monday morning as investors worry about lackluster third-quarter earnings, historically high bond yields, mixed economic data and conflict in the Middle East.
This will be another massive week for the economy and markets alike: the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, Apple reports earnings on Thursday and the October jobs report is due out on Friday."

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.
Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”
S&P 500 is in correction territory as huge market week looms
Wall Street is attempting to bounce back from another rough week.
Stock futures are moving higher on Monday morning. The Dow lost 1.1% Friday to end the week at its lowest point since March, while the S&P 500 fell into a correction, marking a more than 10% drop from its most recent July peak.
CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, tipped into “extreme fear” on Monday morning as investors worry about lackluster third-quarter earnings, historically high bond yields, mixed economic data and conflict in the Middle East.
This will be another massive week for the economy and markets alike: the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, Apple reports earnings on Thursday and the October jobs report is due out on Friday."

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.
Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

 — 
India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.
A view of ongoing road construction at Sewri in Mumbai
The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.
Prime Minister Modi addresses the G20 Leaders' Summit at the Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi on September 9, 2023.
In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”
S&P 500 is in correction territory as huge market week looms
Wall Street is attempting to bounce back from another rough week.
Stock futures are moving higher on Monday morning. The Dow lost 1.1% Friday to end the week at its lowest point since March, while the S&P 500 fell into a correction, marking a more than 10% drop from its most recent July peak.
CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, tipped into “extreme fear” on Monday morning as investors worry about lackluster third-quarter earnings, historically high bond yields, mixed economic data and conflict in the Middle East.
This will be another massive week for the economy and markets alike: the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, Apple reports earnings on Thursday and the October jobs report is due out on Friday."

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.
Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

 — 
India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”
S&P 500 is in correction territory as huge market week looms
Wall Street is attempting to bounce back from another rough week.
Stock futures are moving higher on Monday morning. The Dow lost 1.1% Friday to end the week at its lowest point since March, while the S&P 500 fell into a correction, marking a more than 10% drop from its most recent July peak.
CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, tipped into “extreme fear” on Monday morning as investors worry about lackluster third-quarter earnings, historically high bond yields, mixed economic data and conflict in the Middle East.
This will be another massive week for the economy and markets alike: the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, Apple reports earnings on Thursday and the October jobs report is due out on Friday."

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.

Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
Ad Feedback
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.

Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”
S&P 500 is in correction territory as huge market week looms
Wall Street is attempting to bounce back from another rough week.
Stock futures are moving higher on Monday morning. The Dow lost 1.1% Friday to end the week at its lowest point since March, while the S&P 500 fell into a correction, marking a more than 10% drop from its most recent July peak.
CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, tipped into “extreme fear” on Monday morning as investors worry about lackluster third-quarter earnings, historically high bond yields, mixed economic data and conflict in the Middle East.
This will be another massive week for the economy and markets alike: the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, Apple reports earnings on Thursday and the October jobs report is due out on Friday."

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.

China’s retail sales and factory output grew more than expected in October, official data showed on Wednesday, even as the country’s crisis-hit real estate sector continued to drag on the economy.
Retail sales surged 7.6% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), when pandemic restrictions were still limiting activity. That’s higher than the 7% growth estimated in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Industrial output expanded 4.6% in October, higher than the 4.4% rise forecast by the Reuters poll, while fixed asset investment expanded by 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That was lower than a forecast of 3.1%.
Country Garden has defaulted on its debt. What’s next?
“The economy continued to muddle through in October,” Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “Consumption accelerated on a low base, while property remains the biggest drag [on growth].”
Investment in real estate development fell 9.3% year-on-year in the first 10 months of the year, according to NBS data.
In September, China rolled out a flurry of measures, including loosening requirements for homebuyers across the country, intended to shore up the beleaguered industry.
The industry, which has accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product, remains troubled. Last month, Country Garden, formerly China’s largest homebuilder, was declared to have defaulted on its debt after failing to make a bond repayment by a final deadline of October 18.
Rising on low base
Much attention was paid to retail sales because that’s where “most hopes for an economic pickup” were concentrated, ING economists noted in a report Wednesday.
The larger-than-expected jump of 7.6% was accrued against a low base of comparison. Retail sales in October 2022 contracted by 0.5%, compared to the same month a year earlier, because many cities were in the midst of pandemic lockdowns or other restrictions.
After accounting for the modest base, the new data suggests that China’s overall recovery is “sputtering, but still has legs,” Capital Economics wrote in a report Wednesday.
The consumption data showed that the economy struggled to regain strong momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, “but it was not nearly as weak as some had feared,” with consumer confidence ticking up, they added.
Goldman Sachs analysts said Wednesday that the data reflected “a mixed bag,” saying they would make no change to an earlier forecast of 5.6% economic growth for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The October period encompasses China’s eight-day Golden Week holiday, one of the country’s peak vacation periods. This year, despite hopes for a rebound in consumption, key travel and spending data fell short of government forecasts.
Last month, consumer prices in China also fell more than anticipated, sliding the country back into deflation and renewing concerns about the strength of the world’s second largest economy.
While the drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, economists said it also reflected muted consumer demand.

 — 
India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say.
While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot.
It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.”
A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights.
The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions.
The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
“The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.”
New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world.
This time is different
In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead.
The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion.
The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China.
To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year.
China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis.
“India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added.

The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest.
Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.
The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022.
The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago.
Digital bonanza
India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce.
“Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.”
For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.
Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.

In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”
Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels.
Is it enough?
India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.
But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago.
“India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
“I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.”
That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China.
In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies.
China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote.
And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report.
“Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added."

One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse.
N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work.
“You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday.
Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms.
He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.”
He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China.
The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.”
India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China.
For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do.
Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world.
CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment."

Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Dawson Her Many Horses was rich in culture. But he and his family lacked many other critical resources.
“When I was a kid we had an outhouse, our home was heated by a wood burning stove,” he told CNN. “I understand what it’s like to live in a rural community without financial resources.”
That connection has motivated Her Many Horses to advocate for Native American and Alaskan Native communities throughout his career in finance. He currently serves as head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and in July the bank announced he would become a managing director.
Her Many Horses, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, is one of the first enrolled tribal members to be promoted to managing director at a major US bank, according to a statement from Wells Fargo.
“I’ve made most of my career decisions based on how I can be a better advocate and champion for tribal communities,” he told CNN. “So for me personally, just the fact that I grew up on a reservation and that I still have family there keeps me grounded. It reminds me of why I do this work.”
Before the Bell spoke with Her Many Horses about why Native American populations face a generational wealth gap, a lack of economic data about tribal communities and increasing investment at an institutional level.
Banks should want to do more work with tribal communities, said Her Many Horses, simply because it’s good for business: Wells Fargo has banking relationships with one out of three federally recognized tribes in the United States, with approximately $3.4 billion in credit commitments and $4.1 billion in deposits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Before the Bell: What do investors need to know about investing in Native American and Alaskan Native communities?
Dawson Her Many Horses: Native American and Alaskan Native communities are more than an ethnic group or racial category. Tribal members, like myself, are also members of Native nations. Tribes are considered governments, they’re like states and have a legal status as sovereigns, like states. There are 574 Federally recognized tribes in the United States. And there are business implications to that.
The businesses that tribes own also oftentimes have and retain some of the characteristics of a government. A lot of people know that tribes have casinos — those casino businesses are run like a legal entity related or owned by the tribal government. So what that does is that creates some complexity.
And I think that’s what leads to the third issue, which is the lack of capital and data that leads to underinvestment in tribal communities. We’re invisible largely because there is very little research or reporting on business opportunities in these communities. No one is writing about the businesses that tribes are in, how big they are, their complexity or the amount of jobs they create.
Tribal casinos contribute about 45% of all casino revenue in the US. The National League Gaming Commission, which is the regulator for Native American casinos, publishes a yearly report on gross gaming revenues for casinos. In August they said tribal casinos generated $41 billion in revenue, which is huge. I think it’s something that most people probably don’t recognize.
So is it a lack of knowledge that’s stopping institutional-level investment in these communities?
There’s some nuance to working with tribes and I think sometimes people may not understand how to kind of navigate that nuance. I was talking about tribes as governments that run casinos, for example. As a banker, part of my role is to help our credit folks and our underwriters understand some of those legal nuances so that they can get comfortable lending to these potential borrowers.
It’s the same with potential investors, they may not understand and see these nuances. At Wells Fargo I’m an advocate, I help educate people so they can understand the opportunity. But if a company doesn’t have that in-house expertise, if they don’t have that champion with an understanding of these nuances, that’s going to be a deterrent. Yeah. That will inhibit the flow of capital and investment in tribal communities.
How do we change that?
First of all, we need more economic data. And then we need to bring the different stakeholders together. Ultimately, we don’t own the data. But we’re like an organization that uses data. So when we talk with policymakers and with tribal leaders and tribal organizations we say ‘the private sector uses data to make decisions about investments, where they want to move capital and how they want to leverage resources.’ If we want more capital to flow into tribal communities, we need to think about a way to share data that protects the confidentiality of individual tribes and all the revenue that their businesses own, but also show at the national level what the opportunity is.
There was a report published in 2017 that found tribal housing needs exceed $33 billion. That’s more than what Wells Fargo can do, or what Bank of America or even the Federal Government can do. We need more investor capital to come in and support these tribal housing projects. That’s why data is important. When we can show how profitable tribal businesses are and tribal governments, investors can start to see that these are legitimate borrowers. They feel comfortable investing in their projects, and feel comfortable putting capital in these projects where there’s huge need, like housing, education or health care.
Is this something that regional banks play a larger role in? And has that changed since the banking crisis earlier this year?
The large national banks have always been involved in some way. They were involved because of casinos. All of these big banks have teams that focus on that industry. That’s been the entry point for a lot of financial institutions. Native American Finance has grown and become more understood by bankers, and as bankers leave one institution and go to others they take that knowledge with them.
But regional banks have really stepped up to serve tribes and their regions. What they’ve done is they’ve made it more competitive. When I put my tribal member hat on, I think that’s great. We need competition in the tribal community. That means more benefits, lower rates, better structures and more options for tribes that have been historically underserved.
The challenge now is what the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and what that crisis will be. Most of the regional banks that work with tribes are in a good space. But no one is immune to what’s going on. Some tribes are starting to feel the impact of that, we’ve heard rumblings of regional bank partners not being able to support deals with tribes. In one case, Wells Fargo was able to step in when a regional bank wasn’t able to honor the commitment they made to a client that we’re working with.
You said that casinos were an entry point for banks to work with tribal authorities. What other opportunities are there?
A lot of tribes are looking at government contracting because there is a Federal preference for tribes in that bidding process. They’re thinking about real estate, not necessarily commercial real estate, but the kind of real estate that supports the supply chain: Warehouses and storage facilities — things that support the movement of goods around the country.
Native populations are underbanked when compared to the rest of the country. How does this play into a generational wealth gap and how does that get bridged?
Part of the solution is just talking about it. We’re naming it. When you look at some of the research that gets done, Native American and Alaskan Native households are almost always the most underbanked. We’re trying to understand why.
Native American communities are very rural and there’s a lack of infrastructure. Tribes, don’t have access to broadband and Wi-Fi in the same way that communities in New York City do. As you think about the evolution of banking and banking services in the US, this move towards online, that has an impact. A lot of Native households don’t have access to smartphones. There aren’t cell towers that provide service, there’s no 5G network there. That’s part of the reason.
What are some of the largest misconceptions you see about investing with tribes?
People like to focus on what I call the ‘poverty porn’ aspects of Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Things like unemployment rates. But if we can increase the data we’re getting, we can change the narrative and move away from this deficit model.
We can focus on opportunity. Tribes are the largest employers in areas of South Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma. Alaska regional corporations are among the biggest companies in that state. We have an opportunity to talk about tribal communities in a way that’s positive and shows how we contribute.
My hope is that if we can get more data around this, we can encourage more banks to think about not only investing capital, but maybe even putting branches in some of these areas. I’m hoping that we can jumpstart the flow of capital and support of individual tribal members. And then we’ll start to see all the things that flow from that – more mortgages, more small businesses and bigger, more robust and healthier tribal economies.
The stakes were high for Hershey this Halloween weekend
Last year, customers did their Halloween shopping early. But this year, they’re taking their time, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.
That means that this past weekend, Hershey — which makes Reese’s, Kit Kat (in the US), Twizzlers and more — was counting on shoppers to load up on candy so it could meet its goals. And with regular chocolate sales slowing, the stakes are high, especially as cocoa prices soar.
“Consumers have returned to purchasing their trick-or-treat candy closer to Halloween after supply chain and availability concerns spurred earlier purchases last year,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck said Thursday in prepared remarks discussing the company’s third quarter results.
It’s too soon to tell exactly how things will shake out this year. But earlier this month, things were “off to a little bit of a rocky start,” said Dan Sadler, a principal of client insights at consumer research firm Circana with a specialty in confections.
2021 was a great year for Halloween candy sales, he said, as people were eager to celebrate after Covid shutdowns. Last year was worse. And early this season, sales “have lagged even last year’s off performance,” he said. “We are seeing both chocolate and non-chocolate performance down a little bit.”
S&P 500 is in correction territory as huge market week looms
Wall Street is attempting to bounce back from another rough week.
Stock futures are moving higher on Monday morning. The Dow lost 1.1% Friday to end the week at its lowest point since March, while the S&P 500 fell into a correction, marking a more than 10% drop from its most recent July peak.
CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, tipped into “extreme fear” on Monday morning as investors worry about lackluster third-quarter earnings, historically high bond yields, mixed economic data and conflict in the Middle East.
This will be another massive week for the economy and markets alike: the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, Apple reports earnings on Thursday and the October jobs report is due out on Friday."

Economic data released this week suggests that the US consumer is spending like there’s no tomorrow, but corporate earnings indicate that might not last.
US gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 4.9% during the third quarter, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department.
The measure, which is adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, clocked in well above the previous quarter’s 2.1% pace and economists’ expectations of 4.3% for the third quarter.
Still, corporate earnings this week show that not every consumer is spending freely, and some are likely to continue tightening their purse strings as high interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments and draining of pandemic-era savings deplete their budgets.
Here’s what six corporations and their executives had to say about the US consumer and economy.
Spending on travel: Earnings from discount airlines this week indicate that the gangbusters demand for travel over the past two years could be moderating.
Spirit Airlines said that softer demand and discounted fares contributed to its third quarter loss of roughly $157.6 million. The discount airline reported a $36.4 million loss during the same period last year.
“Unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods,” Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Given these continued trends, we are evaluating our growth profile and our competitive position.”
Southwest Airlines warned of inflationary pressures and a return to pre-pandemic norms, following insatiable demand for revenge travel that came after Covid-era restrictions were lifted. The company met earnings expectations but missed on revenue for its most recent quarter.
“In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023,” said Bob Jordan, chief executive at Southwest, during the company’s earnings call. “For the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets and designing schedules for current travel patterns.”
Spending on goods: Some companies producing goods, which consumers have cast aside in favor of experiences for the last two years after staying cooped up indoors during the pandemic, also warned of tougher times in the months to come.
Mattel saw Barbie sales climb more than 16% during the third quarter year-over-year, after the release of its blockbuster “Barbie” movie this summer, and beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. The film is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.
The toy-maker said that it expects a strong holiday season but remains cautious about the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
“We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand,” Anthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer at Mattel, said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call.
Rival Hasbro struck a similar tone, slashing its full-year guidance to forecast a 13% to 15% drop in revenue from the 3% to 6% decline that it previously predicted.
“The impact of the broader toy category declines has had a change in our consumer products and total Hasbro outlook,” said Gina Goetter, chief financial officer at Hasbro, during the company’s earnings call. “We believe that retailers will remain cautious with their inventory positions which will have an impact on typical holiday order patterns.”
But Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter reported on Thursday after the close. The e-commerce giant also projected fourth-quarter revenue between $160 billion and $167 billion, which would be up from the $149.2 billion it reported for the same period last year.
“This is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come,” said CEO Andy Jassy in a press release.
It’s not just the US that’s seeing an increasingly frugal consumer. UPS, a perceived economic bellwether, trimmed its full-year revenue and profit margin outlooks Thursday, citing uncertainty about the global economy.
The delivery giant also noted softening demand in the US during the third quarter, and lower consumer spending in large European markets including Germany and the UK. Germany has already likely fallen back into recession, and the rest of the euro area economy could follow. China’s real estate crisis continues to hobble growth there.
“Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging,” said Brian Newman, chief financial officer at UPS, on the company’s earnings call. “While consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter.”
Mortgage rates edge closer to 8%
Mortgage rates continued to climb this week amid a stronger-than-expected economy, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.79% in the week ending October 26, up from 7.63% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 7.08%.
“For the seventh week in a row, mortgage rates continued to climb toward eight percent, resulting in the longest consecutive rise since the Spring of 2022,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Rates have been on a tear in 2023, rising two full percentage points.
“Purchase activity has slowed to a virtual standstill, affordability remains a significant hurdle for many and the only way to address it is lower rates and greater inventory,” he said.

How Country Garden became the face of China’s property crisis
Move over Evergrande. There is a new poster child of China’s protracted real estate crisis — Country Garden, report my colleagues Michelle Toh, Laura He and Diksha Madhok.
The homebuilder, once the country’s largest, has defaulted on an international bond for the first time after failing to make payment within a grace period that expired last week, according to separate reports from Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.
Country Garden has not responded to requests for comment by phone or email. Citigroup, reportedly the bond’s trustee with authority to enforce its terms, declined comment. But late Thursday, a panel of global banks and investors determined that a “failure to pay” event had occurred on October 18.
The developer, which has $190 billion in liabilities, had dodged default on multiple occasions in the past month. But persistent weakness in China’s property market and a difficult refinancing environment had hobbled its ability to raise enough cash to service debt of $15 billion falling due by June 2024. Earlier this month, it warned investors that it could default.
The company is now heading towards a debt restructuring, and possibly a messy financial collapse that would send new shockwaves through China’s sputtering economy.
