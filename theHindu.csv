On the positive side, the brokerage said credit demand is bottoming out and the real lending rates, adjusted for wholesale price inflation, are falling.
It can be noted that there has been a slew of reports lately about a stronger recovery being underway after the jolt caused by the pandemic. The government expects the GDP to contract 7.7% in financial year 2021 because of the reverses.
“The bad news is that the continued drop in our BofA India Activity Indicator reinforces our view that the economy still remains weak,” the brokerage said in a note.
The indicator fell by 0.6% in November on top of the 0.8% decline in October, and 4.6% drop in the September quarter, it said, adding, “this supports our call of GVA (gross value added) contractions of 1% in the December quarter and 6.7% in FY21.”
The credit growth for FY22 will come at 12%, it said. It can be noted that credit growth had been declining for the last few years, in sync with a dip in the overall economic growth which has been on a downward spiral since demonetisation in late 2016 as borrowers went slow on expansion.
The real lending rates adjusted for WPI will be one of the prime reasons for the faster credit growth estimate in financial year 2022, the brokerage said.

The data currently available do not hold any assurance for the country’s economic revival anytime soon, he stated.
“The condition of the Indian economy is on shaky ground. After witnessing the present [growth] data, just can’t be sure about it [revival of economy in the near future]. In the last five-six years, we could at least witness some growth, but now that assurance is also gone,” Mr. Banerjee told a news channel from the U.S.
  The 58-year-old economist, who bagged the coveted prize jointly with his wife Esther Duflo and another economist Michael Kremer for his “experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”, said he never thought he would get a Nobel so early in his career.
“I have been doing this research for the last twenty years. We have tried offering solutions towards alleviation of poverty,” Mr. Banerjee, who is currently the Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said.

Mr. Panagariya, in an interview to PTI , however also emphasised that the country needs to conquer COVID-19 as quickly and decisively as possible.
""Here the news on vaccination front is excellent. I only wish that we as citizens do our bit and religiously wear masks when coming in contact with others,"" he said.
""In the third as well as fourth quarter of 2020-21, real GDP had already crossed pre-Covid-19 level... these facts tell me that the fundamentals of the economy are sound,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Indian economy grew by a record 20.1% in the April-June quarter this fiscal, helped by a very weak base of last year and a sharp rebound in the manufacturing and services sectors in spite of a devastating second wave of COVID-19.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered the country's growth projection for the current financial year to 9.5 % from 10.5% estimated earlier, while the World Bank has projected India's economy to grow at 8.3% in 2021.
Mr. Panagariya, a professor of economics at Columbia University pointed out that contrary to the general impression, private investment in India has certainly already picked up.
""In both Q3 and Q4 of FY21, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) at 33% and 34.3% of GDP, respectively, was higher than in the corresponding (pre-Covid-19) quarters a year earlier,"" he said.
Replying to a question on foreign capital inflows, the eminent economist said, “Let us be clear that they have not resulted just from quantitative easing (QE)”
""True, QE encourages capital to move out of the advanced economies but that does not guarantee that it will come to India and not go to other emerging market economies,"" he said adding that it chooses India because of the high returns that the Indian economy promises.
As tapering happens in the advanced economies, Mr. Panagariya said the threat of some reversal naturally remains though the final outcome will depend on how much higher the returns in India remain relative to those in the advanced economies.
On the stock market boom at a time when economic growth has slowed down, he said there may be a disconnect but not necessarily.
Noting that stock market prices are driven by the expectations of future returns, he said, ""Given the high potential of the Indian economy, what we see in terms of high stock prices may well be a rational response by equity investors."" On recent calls for using the huge Forex reserves for infrastructure development or recapitalisation of public sector banks, the eminent economist said he generally does not approve of mixing up monetary policy and RBI FX operations with fiscal policy.
According to Mr. Panagariya, whatever funds that flow from the RBI to the government should be done transparently in terms of the usual annual transfers out of RBI earnings. Noting that the ability of the RBI to defend the exchange rate in the presence of large capital flows depends on its FX reserves, he said, ""As a rule, we should restrain from undermining this ability by raiding the FX reserves for fiscal purposes.""
Asked if high CPI and WPI inflation is a matter of concern, Mr. Panagariya said indeed, at a time when the economy is still in the recovery phase, inflation in the range of 6 % is a good thing.
""Profits of firms and expenditures and revenues of the government are measured in nominal terms and slightly higher inflation helps healthy growth in them at a time when the economy is operating at less than full capacity,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya observed that the 4% target with a 2% band around it should not be seen as a mandate to hold inflation always below 4%.
Asked what fiscal measures are necessary to support households in distress, he said India's social safety nets have expanded significantly in the last one and a half decades.
""I do not see how we can borrow more even when the goal is as noble as helping the poor without putting the burden on the future generations through increased debt,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya suggested, ""If we must expand social safety nets further at current levels of income, I would favour further rejigging of the existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor."" India has recently rejigged existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor, for example, diverting LPG subsidy from urban households to rural BPL households.
On the periodic labour force survey (PLFS) data, both annual and quarterly showing a marked deterioration in the quality of jobs, Mr. Panagariya said, ""We certainly need to move workers out of agriculture into industry and services. From this perspective, the reverse movement is disturbing.""
He, however, added that though, he would not read too much in the 2019-20 PLFS survey without a closer examination of what role in these estimates has played by the worker movement during March-June 2020.

8,The Hindu,Indian economy: Deja vu? But things seem better than in 2013 - The ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/deja-vu-but-things-seem-better-than-in-2013/article24910089.ece,,"Those with a long memory must be consumed by a sense of deja vu over developments in the past few weeks. In many ways, the present turbulent times are reminiscent of what happened in 2013.
The rupee was in a tailspin. Oil prices were booming at over $110 a barrel, exerting upward pressure on domestic retail prices of petroleum products. The current account deficit was in dangerous territory at 4.8% and the country was headed for general elections in a just a few months.
It is almost a repeat now even if some of the macro numbers are not as dramatically negative as they were then.
These are without doubt challenging times but the picture is not as dismal as it was in 2013. And that’s because of three major factors.
First and most important, growth is on the ascendant. The economy seems to have shrugged off the twin shocks from the note ban and introduction of the GST. Admittedly, the 8.1% GDP growth in the first quarter of this fiscal was amplified by the lower base in the same period last year when manufacturers slowed down ahead of the introduction of GST. But there is no mistaking the strong underlying growth impulse supported by a return of consumer spending.
Fiscal management
Second, attribute it to deft fiscal management by the Centre or to the dividends from the soft oil price regime of the last four years , the fiscal deficit is at a very respectable level of 3.3-3.5%. In comparison, the deficit in fiscal 2013 was 4.9% and in 2014 was 4.5%.
Finally, the political leadership does seem conscious of its fiscal responsibility; at least, it has been so until now. Despite calls from several quarters to loosen purse strings and cast aside the fiscal deficit marker, the Centre has refused to do so. At most, it has allowed itself the luxury of postponing the date of meeting that magic level of 3% to 2021. The temptation to step on the expenditure pedal will undoubtedly be high in an election year but we have not seen any indications of that until now.
The Centre’s reaction to the twin shocks of the rupee fall and rise in oil prices are instructive. Even as the media has been going to town over new highs in petrol prices ever day and demanding a cut in excise duty, the Centre has remained unmoved and allowed the higher prices to pass through. With almost a quarter of the Centre’s total revenue coming from fuel taxes, any cut will have an impact on the fiscal deficit.
Similarly, the reaction of the RBI and the Centre to the rupee’s fall has been prudent. The rupee has been allowed to find its natural level and the central bank has stepped in only to smooth volatility; no reactionary measures such as forex deposits swap or restrictions on capital outflows as in 2013. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may be anxious but he has exhibited none of it in public as he held on to the refrain that the rupee is not alone in its predicament and that global factors are more responsible for the weakness than domestic ones.
So, do all these mean that there’s nothing to worry about? Certainly not.
The biggest risks are external and how they will play out domestically. The combined impact of elevated oil prices and a weak rupee can cause serious damage to the economy. The pass-through of higher fuel prices is sure to push up retail inflation; the impact may be seen as early as in the August print expected tomorrow. This could prompt the RBI to front load its second rate hike for this fiscal as early as in October.
Private consumption spending, which rose to 8.6% in the first quarter of this fiscal giving a boost to overall growth might well suffer a reverse as consumers pull back from the twin shocks of rising fuel prices and higher interest rates. This will have adverse consequences for GDP growth especially given that private investment is still to fully recover.
Second, the RBI may have let the rupee fall until now but indications are a further fall will be defended, which means a drain on forex reserves. The Centre may also be forced to step in and cut taxes on fuels with obvious implications for the fisc.
Finally, there is no saying what one Donald Trump would do next. The tariff war that he has set off has thrown challenges for India as well. In sum, these are piquant times indeed for the economy.
Update
A number of readers have pointed out that the new series GDP data should have been taken for comparison in both time periods, Q1 2013-14 and Q1 2018-19. The analysis in the article holds even if we take the new series data. As per the new series, growth in the first quarter of 2013-14 was 6.4 per cent, still substantially lower than the latest quarter's growth

The real lending rates adjusted for WPI will be one of the prime reasons for the faster credit growth estimate in financial year 2022, the brokerage said.

The data currently available do not hold any assurance for the country’s economic revival anytime soon, he stated.
“The condition of the Indian economy is on shaky ground. After witnessing the present [growth] data, just can’t be sure about it [revival of economy in the near future]. In the last five-six years, we could at least witness some growth, but now that assurance is also gone,” Mr. Banerjee told a news channel from the U.S.
  The 58-year-old economist, who bagged the coveted prize jointly with his wife Esther Duflo and another economist Michael Kremer for his “experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”, said he never thought he would get a Nobel so early in his career.
“I have been doing this research for the last twenty years. We have tried offering solutions towards alleviation of poverty,” Mr. Banerjee, who is currently the Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said.

Mr. Panagariya, in an interview to PTI , however also emphasised that the country needs to conquer COVID-19 as quickly and decisively as possible.
""Here the news on vaccination front is excellent. I only wish that we as citizens do our bit and religiously wear masks when coming in contact with others,"" he said.
""In the third as well as fourth quarter of 2020-21, real GDP had already crossed pre-Covid-19 level... these facts tell me that the fundamentals of the economy are sound,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Indian economy grew by a record 20.1% in the April-June quarter this fiscal, helped by a very weak base of last year and a sharp rebound in the manufacturing and services sectors in spite of a devastating second wave of COVID-19.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered the country's growth projection for the current financial year to 9.5 % from 10.5% estimated earlier, while the World Bank has projected India's economy to grow at 8.3% in 2021.
Mr. Panagariya, a professor of economics at Columbia University pointed out that contrary to the general impression, private investment in India has certainly already picked up.
""In both Q3 and Q4 of FY21, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) at 33% and 34.3% of GDP, respectively, was higher than in the corresponding (pre-Covid-19) quarters a year earlier,"" he said.
Replying to a question on foreign capital inflows, the eminent economist said, “Let us be clear that they have not resulted just from quantitative easing (QE)”
""True, QE encourages capital to move out of the advanced economies but that does not guarantee that it will come to India and not go to other emerging market economies,"" he said adding that it chooses India because of the high returns that the Indian economy promises.
As tapering happens in the advanced economies, Mr. Panagariya said the threat of some reversal naturally remains though the final outcome will depend on how much higher the returns in India remain relative to those in the advanced economies.
On the stock market boom at a time when economic growth has slowed down, he said there may be a disconnect but not necessarily.
Noting that stock market prices are driven by the expectations of future returns, he said, ""Given the high potential of the Indian economy, what we see in terms of high stock prices may well be a rational response by equity investors."" On recent calls for using the huge Forex reserves for infrastructure development or recapitalisation of public sector banks, the eminent economist said he generally does not approve of mixing up monetary policy and RBI FX operations with fiscal policy.
According to Mr. Panagariya, whatever funds that flow from the RBI to the government should be done transparently in terms of the usual annual transfers out of RBI earnings. Noting that the ability of the RBI to defend the exchange rate in the presence of large capital flows depends on its FX reserves, he said, ""As a rule, we should restrain from undermining this ability by raiding the FX reserves for fiscal purposes.""
Asked if high CPI and WPI inflation is a matter of concern, Mr. Panagariya said indeed, at a time when the economy is still in the recovery phase, inflation in the range of 6 % is a good thing.
""Profits of firms and expenditures and revenues of the government are measured in nominal terms and slightly higher inflation helps healthy growth in them at a time when the economy is operating at less than full capacity,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya observed that the 4% target with a 2% band around it should not be seen as a mandate to hold inflation always below 4%.
Asked what fiscal measures are necessary to support households in distress, he said India's social safety nets have expanded significantly in the last one and a half decades.
""I do not see how we can borrow more even when the goal is as noble as helping the poor without putting the burden on the future generations through increased debt,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya suggested, ""If we must expand social safety nets further at current levels of income, I would favour further rejigging of the existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor."" India has recently rejigged existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor, for example, diverting LPG subsidy from urban households to rural BPL households.
On the periodic labour force survey (PLFS) data, both annual and quarterly showing a marked deterioration in the quality of jobs, Mr. Panagariya said, ""We certainly need to move workers out of agriculture into industry and services. From this perspective, the reverse movement is disturbing.""
He, however, added that though, he would not read too much in the 2019-20 PLFS survey without a closer examination of what role in these estimates has played by the worker movement during March-June 2020.

28,The Hindu,Indian economy: Deja vu? But things seem better than in 2013 - The ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/deja-vu-but-things-seem-better-than-in-2013/article24910089.ece,,"Those with a long memory must be consumed by a sense of deja vu over developments in the past few weeks. In many ways, the present turbulent times are reminiscent of what happened in 2013.
The rupee was in a tailspin. Oil prices were booming at over $110 a barrel, exerting upward pressure on domestic retail prices of petroleum products. The current account deficit was in dangerous territory at 4.8% and the country was headed for general elections in a just a few months.
It is almost a repeat now even if some of the macro numbers are not as dramatically negative as they were then.
These are without doubt challenging times but the picture is not as dismal as it was in 2013. And that’s because of three major factors.
First and most important, growth is on the ascendant. The economy seems to have shrugged off the twin shocks from the note ban and introduction of the GST. Admittedly, the 8.1% GDP growth in the first quarter of this fiscal was amplified by the lower base in the same period last year when manufacturers slowed down ahead of the introduction of GST. But there is no mistaking the strong underlying growth impulse supported by a return of consumer spending.
Fiscal management
Second, attribute it to deft fiscal management by the Centre or to the dividends from the soft oil price regime of the last four years , the fiscal deficit is at a very respectable level of 3.3-3.5%. In comparison, the deficit in fiscal 2013 was 4.9% and in 2014 was 4.5%.
Finally, the political leadership does seem conscious of its fiscal responsibility; at least, it has been so until now. Despite calls from several quarters to loosen purse strings and cast aside the fiscal deficit marker, the Centre has refused to do so. At most, it has allowed itself the luxury of postponing the date of meeting that magic level of 3% to 2021. The temptation to step on the expenditure pedal will undoubtedly be high in an election year but we have not seen any indications of that until now.
The Centre’s reaction to the twin shocks of the rupee fall and rise in oil prices are instructive. Even as the media has been going to town over new highs in petrol prices ever day and demanding a cut in excise duty, the Centre has remained unmoved and allowed the higher prices to pass through. With almost a quarter of the Centre’s total revenue coming from fuel taxes, any cut will have an impact on the fiscal deficit.
Similarly, the reaction of the RBI and the Centre to the rupee’s fall has been prudent. The rupee has been allowed to find its natural level and the central bank has stepped in only to smooth volatility; no reactionary measures such as forex deposits swap or restrictions on capital outflows as in 2013. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may be anxious but he has exhibited none of it in public as he held on to the refrain that the rupee is not alone in its predicament and that global factors are more responsible for the weakness than domestic ones.
So, do all these mean that there’s nothing to worry about? Certainly not.
The biggest risks are external and how they will play out domestically. The combined impact of elevated oil prices and a weak rupee can cause serious damage to the economy. The pass-through of higher fuel prices is sure to push up retail inflation; the impact may be seen as early as in the August print expected tomorrow. This could prompt the RBI to front load its second rate hike for this fiscal as early as in October.
Private consumption spending, which rose to 8.6% in the first quarter of this fiscal giving a boost to overall growth might well suffer a reverse as consumers pull back from the twin shocks of rising fuel prices and higher interest rates. This will have adverse consequences for GDP growth especially given that private investment is still to fully recover.
Second, the RBI may have let the rupee fall until now but indications are a further fall will be defended, which means a drain on forex reserves. The Centre may also be forced to step in and cut taxes on fuels with obvious implications for the fisc.
Finally, there is no saying what one Donald Trump would do next. The tariff war that he has set off has thrown challenges for India as well. In sum, these are piquant times indeed for the economy.
Update
A number of readers have pointed out that the new series GDP data should have been taken for comparison in both time periods, Q1 2013-14 and Q1 2018-19. The analysis in the article holds even if we take the new series data. As per the new series, growth in the first quarter of 2013-14 was 6.4 per cent, still substantially lower than the latest quarter's growth

On the positive side, the brokerage said credit demand is bottoming out and the real lending rates, adjusted for wholesale price inflation, are falling.

The data currently available do not hold any assurance for the country’s economic revival anytime soon, he stated.
“The condition of the Indian economy is on shaky ground. After witnessing the present [growth] data, just can’t be sure about it [revival of economy in the near future]. In the last five-six years, we could at least witness some growth, but now that assurance is also gone,” Mr. Banerjee told a news channel from the U.S.
  The 58-year-old economist, who bagged the coveted prize jointly with his wife Esther Duflo and another economist Michael Kremer for his “experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”, said he never thought he would get a Nobel so early in his career.
“I have been doing this research for the last twenty years. We have tried offering solutions towards alleviation of poverty,” Mr. Banerjee, who is currently the Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said.

Mr. Panagariya, in an interview to PTI , however also emphasised that the country needs to conquer COVID-19 as quickly and decisively as possible.
""Here the news on vaccination front is excellent. I only wish that we as citizens do our bit and religiously wear masks when coming in contact with others,"" he said.
""In the third as well as fourth quarter of 2020-21, real GDP had already crossed pre-Covid-19 level... these facts tell me that the fundamentals of the economy are sound,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Indian economy grew by a record 20.1% in the April-June quarter this fiscal, helped by a very weak base of last year and a sharp rebound in the manufacturing and services sectors in spite of a devastating second wave of COVID-19.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered the country's growth projection for the current financial year to 9.5 % from 10.5% estimated earlier, while the World Bank has projected India's economy to grow at 8.3% in 2021.
Mr. Panagariya, a professor of economics at Columbia University pointed out that contrary to the general impression, private investment in India has certainly already picked up.
""In both Q3 and Q4 of FY21, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) at 33% and 34.3% of GDP, respectively, was higher than in the corresponding (pre-Covid-19) quarters a year earlier,"" he said.
Replying to a question on foreign capital inflows, the eminent economist said, “Let us be clear that they have not resulted just from quantitative easing (QE)”
""True, QE encourages capital to move out of the advanced economies but that does not guarantee that it will come to India and not go to other emerging market economies,"" he said adding that it chooses India because of the high returns that the Indian economy promises.
As tapering happens in the advanced economies, Mr. Panagariya said the threat of some reversal naturally remains though the final outcome will depend on how much higher the returns in India remain relative to those in the advanced economies.
On the stock market boom at a time when economic growth has slowed down, he said there may be a disconnect but not necessarily.
Noting that stock market prices are driven by the expectations of future returns, he said, ""Given the high potential of the Indian economy, what we see in terms of high stock prices may well be a rational response by equity investors."" On recent calls for using the huge Forex reserves for infrastructure development or recapitalisation of public sector banks, the eminent economist said he generally does not approve of mixing up monetary policy and RBI FX operations with fiscal policy.
According to Mr. Panagariya, whatever funds that flow from the RBI to the government should be done transparently in terms of the usual annual transfers out of RBI earnings. Noting that the ability of the RBI to defend the exchange rate in the presence of large capital flows depends on its FX reserves, he said, ""As a rule, we should restrain from undermining this ability by raiding the FX reserves for fiscal purposes.""
Asked if high CPI and WPI inflation is a matter of concern, Mr. Panagariya said indeed, at a time when the economy is still in the recovery phase, inflation in the range of 6 % is a good thing.
""Profits of firms and expenditures and revenues of the government are measured in nominal terms and slightly higher inflation helps healthy growth in them at a time when the economy is operating at less than full capacity,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya observed that the 4% target with a 2% band around it should not be seen as a mandate to hold inflation always below 4%.
Asked what fiscal measures are necessary to support households in distress, he said India's social safety nets have expanded significantly in the last one and a half decades.
""I do not see how we can borrow more even when the goal is as noble as helping the poor without putting the burden on the future generations through increased debt,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya suggested, ""If we must expand social safety nets further at current levels of income, I would favour further rejigging of the existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor."" India has recently rejigged existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor, for example, diverting LPG subsidy from urban households to rural BPL households.
On the periodic labour force survey (PLFS) data, both annual and quarterly showing a marked deterioration in the quality of jobs, Mr. Panagariya said, ""We certainly need to move workers out of agriculture into industry and services. From this perspective, the reverse movement is disturbing.""
He, however, added that though, he would not read too much in the 2019-20 PLFS survey without a closer examination of what role in these estimates has played by the worker movement during March-June 2020.

48,The Hindu,Indian economy: Deja vu? But things seem better than in 2013 - The ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/deja-vu-but-things-seem-better-than-in-2013/article24910089.ece,,"Those with a long memory must be consumed by a sense of deja vu over developments in the past few weeks. In many ways, the present turbulent times are reminiscent of what happened in 2013.
The rupee was in a tailspin. Oil prices were booming at over $110 a barrel, exerting upward pressure on domestic retail prices of petroleum products. The current account deficit was in dangerous territory at 4.8% and the country was headed for general elections in a just a few months.
It is almost a repeat now even if some of the macro numbers are not as dramatically negative as they were then.
These are without doubt challenging times but the picture is not as dismal as it was in 2013. And that’s because of three major factors.
First and most important, growth is on the ascendant. The economy seems to have shrugged off the twin shocks from the note ban and introduction of the GST. Admittedly, the 8.1% GDP growth in the first quarter of this fiscal was amplified by the lower base in the same period last year when manufacturers slowed down ahead of the introduction of GST. But there is no mistaking the strong underlying growth impulse supported by a return of consumer spending.
Fiscal management
Second, attribute it to deft fiscal management by the Centre or to the dividends from the soft oil price regime of the last four years , the fiscal deficit is at a very respectable level of 3.3-3.5%. In comparison, the deficit in fiscal 2013 was 4.9% and in 2014 was 4.5%.
Finally, the political leadership does seem conscious of its fiscal responsibility; at least, it has been so until now. Despite calls from several quarters to loosen purse strings and cast aside the fiscal deficit marker, the Centre has refused to do so. At most, it has allowed itself the luxury of postponing the date of meeting that magic level of 3% to 2021. The temptation to step on the expenditure pedal will undoubtedly be high in an election year but we have not seen any indications of that until now.
The Centre’s reaction to the twin shocks of the rupee fall and rise in oil prices are instructive. Even as the media has been going to town over new highs in petrol prices ever day and demanding a cut in excise duty, the Centre has remained unmoved and allowed the higher prices to pass through. With almost a quarter of the Centre’s total revenue coming from fuel taxes, any cut will have an impact on the fiscal deficit.
Similarly, the reaction of the RBI and the Centre to the rupee’s fall has been prudent. The rupee has been allowed to find its natural level and the central bank has stepped in only to smooth volatility; no reactionary measures such as forex deposits swap or restrictions on capital outflows as in 2013. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may be anxious but he has exhibited none of it in public as he held on to the refrain that the rupee is not alone in its predicament and that global factors are more responsible for the weakness than domestic ones.
So, do all these mean that there’s nothing to worry about? Certainly not.
The biggest risks are external and how they will play out domestically. The combined impact of elevated oil prices and a weak rupee can cause serious damage to the economy. The pass-through of higher fuel prices is sure to push up retail inflation; the impact may be seen as early as in the August print expected tomorrow. This could prompt the RBI to front load its second rate hike for this fiscal as early as in October.
Private consumption spending, which rose to 8.6% in the first quarter of this fiscal giving a boost to overall growth might well suffer a reverse as consumers pull back from the twin shocks of rising fuel prices and higher interest rates. This will have adverse consequences for GDP growth especially given that private investment is still to fully recover.
Second, the RBI may have let the rupee fall until now but indications are a further fall will be defended, which means a drain on forex reserves. The Centre may also be forced to step in and cut taxes on fuels with obvious implications for the fisc.
Finally, there is no saying what one Donald Trump would do next. The tariff war that he has set off has thrown challenges for India as well. In sum, these are piquant times indeed for the economy.
Update
A number of readers have pointed out that the new series GDP data should have been taken for comparison in both time periods, Q1 2013-14 and Q1 2018-19. The analysis in the article holds even if we take the new series data. As per the new series, growth in the first quarter of 2013-14 was 6.4 per cent, still substantially lower than the latest quarter's growth

On the positive side, the brokerage said credit demand is bottoming out and the real lending rates, adjusted for wholesale price inflation, are falling.
It can be noted that there has been a slew of reports lately about a stronger recovery being underway after the jolt caused by the pandemic. The government expects the GDP to contract 7.7% in financial year 2021 because of the reverses.
“The bad news is that the continued drop in our BofA India Activity Indicator reinforces our view that the economy still remains weak,” the brokerage said in a note.
The indicator fell by 0.6% in November on top of the 0.8% decline in October, and 4.6% drop in the September quarter, it said, adding, “this supports our call of GVA (gross value added) contractions of 1% in the December quarter and 6.7% in FY21.”
The credit growth for FY22 will come at 12%, it said. It can be noted that credit growth had been declining for the last few years, in sync with a dip in the overall economic growth which has been on a downward spiral since demonetisation in late 2016 as borrowers went slow on expansion.
The real lending rates adjusted for WPI will be one of the prime reasons for the faster credit growth estimate in financial year 2022, the brokerage said.

The data currently available do not hold any assurance for the country’s economic revival anytime soon, he stated.
“The condition of the Indian economy is on shaky ground. After witnessing the present [growth] data, just can’t be sure about it [revival of economy in the near future]. In the last five-six years, we could at least witness some growth, but now that assurance is also gone,” Mr. Banerjee told a news channel from the U.S.
  The 58-year-old economist, who bagged the coveted prize jointly with his wife Esther Duflo and another economist Michael Kremer for his “experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”, said he never thought he would get a Nobel so early in his career.
“I have been doing this research for the last twenty years. We have tried offering solutions towards alleviation of poverty,” Mr. Banerjee, who is currently the Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said.

Mr. Panagariya, in an interview to PTI , however also emphasised that the country needs to conquer COVID-19 as quickly and decisively as possible.
""Here the news on vaccination front is excellent. I only wish that we as citizens do our bit and religiously wear masks when coming in contact with others,"" he said.
""In the third as well as fourth quarter of 2020-21, real GDP had already crossed pre-Covid-19 level... these facts tell me that the fundamentals of the economy are sound,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Indian economy grew by a record 20.1% in the April-June quarter this fiscal, helped by a very weak base of last year and a sharp rebound in the manufacturing and services sectors in spite of a devastating second wave of COVID-19.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered the country's growth projection for the current financial year to 9.5 % from 10.5% estimated earlier, while the World Bank has projected India's economy to grow at 8.3% in 2021.
Mr. Panagariya, a professor of economics at Columbia University pointed out that contrary to the general impression, private investment in India has certainly already picked up.
""In both Q3 and Q4 of FY21, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) at 33% and 34.3% of GDP, respectively, was higher than in the corresponding (pre-Covid-19) quarters a year earlier,"" he said.
Replying to a question on foreign capital inflows, the eminent economist said, “Let us be clear that they have not resulted just from quantitative easing (QE)”
""True, QE encourages capital to move out of the advanced economies but that does not guarantee that it will come to India and not go to other emerging market economies,"" he said adding that it chooses India because of the high returns that the Indian economy promises.
As tapering happens in the advanced economies, Mr. Panagariya said the threat of some reversal naturally remains though the final outcome will depend on how much higher the returns in India remain relative to those in the advanced economies.
On the stock market boom at a time when economic growth has slowed down, he said there may be a disconnect but not necessarily.
Noting that stock market prices are driven by the expectations of future returns, he said, ""Given the high potential of the Indian economy, what we see in terms of high stock prices may well be a rational response by equity investors."" On recent calls for using the huge Forex reserves for infrastructure development or recapitalisation of public sector banks, the eminent economist said he generally does not approve of mixing up monetary policy and RBI FX operations with fiscal policy.
According to Mr. Panagariya, whatever funds that flow from the RBI to the government should be done transparently in terms of the usual annual transfers out of RBI earnings. Noting that the ability of the RBI to defend the exchange rate in the presence of large capital flows depends on its FX reserves, he said, ""As a rule, we should restrain from undermining this ability by raiding the FX reserves for fiscal purposes.""
Asked if high CPI and WPI inflation is a matter of concern, Mr. Panagariya said indeed, at a time when the economy is still in the recovery phase, inflation in the range of 6 % is a good thing.
""Profits of firms and expenditures and revenues of the government are measured in nominal terms and slightly higher inflation helps healthy growth in them at a time when the economy is operating at less than full capacity,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya observed that the 4% target with a 2% band around it should not be seen as a mandate to hold inflation always below 4%.
Asked what fiscal measures are necessary to support households in distress, he said India's social safety nets have expanded significantly in the last one and a half decades.
""I do not see how we can borrow more even when the goal is as noble as helping the poor without putting the burden on the future generations through increased debt,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya suggested, ""If we must expand social safety nets further at current levels of income, I would favour further rejigging of the existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor."" India has recently rejigged existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor, for example, diverting LPG subsidy from urban households to rural BPL households.
On the periodic labour force survey (PLFS) data, both annual and quarterly showing a marked deterioration in the quality of jobs, Mr. Panagariya said, ""We certainly need to move workers out of agriculture into industry and services. From this perspective, the reverse movement is disturbing.""
He, however, added that though, he would not read too much in the 2019-20 PLFS survey without a closer examination of what role in these estimates has played by the worker movement during March-June 2020.

68,The Hindu,Indian economy: Deja vu? But things seem better than in 2013 - The ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/deja-vu-but-things-seem-better-than-in-2013/article24910089.ece,,"Those with a long memory must be consumed by a sense of deja vu over developments in the past few weeks. In many ways, the present turbulent times are reminiscent of what happened in 2013.
The rupee was in a tailspin. Oil prices were booming at over $110 a barrel, exerting upward pressure on domestic retail prices of petroleum products. The current account deficit was in dangerous territory at 4.8% and the country was headed for general elections in a just a few months.
It is almost a repeat now even if some of the macro numbers are not as dramatically negative as they were then.
These are without doubt challenging times but the picture is not as dismal as it was in 2013. And that’s because of three major factors.
First and most important, growth is on the ascendant. The economy seems to have shrugged off the twin shocks from the note ban and introduction of the GST. Admittedly, the 8.1% GDP growth in the first quarter of this fiscal was amplified by the lower base in the same period last year when manufacturers slowed down ahead of the introduction of GST. But there is no mistaking the strong underlying growth impulse supported by a return of consumer spending.
Fiscal management
Second, attribute it to deft fiscal management by the Centre or to the dividends from the soft oil price regime of the last four years , the fiscal deficit is at a very respectable level of 3.3-3.5%. In comparison, the deficit in fiscal 2013 was 4.9% and in 2014 was 4.5%.
Finally, the political leadership does seem conscious of its fiscal responsibility; at least, it has been so until now. Despite calls from several quarters to loosen purse strings and cast aside the fiscal deficit marker, the Centre has refused to do so. At most, it has allowed itself the luxury of postponing the date of meeting that magic level of 3% to 2021. The temptation to step on the expenditure pedal will undoubtedly be high in an election year but we have not seen any indications of that until now.
The Centre’s reaction to the twin shocks of the rupee fall and rise in oil prices are instructive. Even as the media has been going to town over new highs in petrol prices ever day and demanding a cut in excise duty, the Centre has remained unmoved and allowed the higher prices to pass through. With almost a quarter of the Centre’s total revenue coming from fuel taxes, any cut will have an impact on the fiscal deficit.
Similarly, the reaction of the RBI and the Centre to the rupee’s fall has been prudent. The rupee has been allowed to find its natural level and the central bank has stepped in only to smooth volatility; no reactionary measures such as forex deposits swap or restrictions on capital outflows as in 2013. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may be anxious but he has exhibited none of it in public as he held on to the refrain that the rupee is not alone in its predicament and that global factors are more responsible for the weakness than domestic ones.
So, do all these mean that there’s nothing to worry about? Certainly not.
The biggest risks are external and how they will play out domestically. The combined impact of elevated oil prices and a weak rupee can cause serious damage to the economy. The pass-through of higher fuel prices is sure to push up retail inflation; the impact may be seen as early as in the August print expected tomorrow. This could prompt the RBI to front load its second rate hike for this fiscal as early as in October.
Private consumption spending, which rose to 8.6% in the first quarter of this fiscal giving a boost to overall growth might well suffer a reverse as consumers pull back from the twin shocks of rising fuel prices and higher interest rates. This will have adverse consequences for GDP growth especially given that private investment is still to fully recover.
Second, the RBI may have let the rupee fall until now but indications are a further fall will be defended, which means a drain on forex reserves. The Centre may also be forced to step in and cut taxes on fuels with obvious implications for the fisc.
Finally, there is no saying what one Donald Trump would do next. The tariff war that he has set off has thrown challenges for India as well. In sum, these are piquant times indeed for the economy.
Update
A number of readers have pointed out that the new series GDP data should have been taken for comparison in both time periods, Q1 2013-14 and Q1 2018-19. The analysis in the article holds even if we take the new series data. As per the new series, growth in the first quarter of 2013-14 was 6.4 per cent, still substantially lower than the latest quarter's growth

On the positive side, the brokerage said credit demand is bottoming out and the real lending rates, adjusted for wholesale price inflation, are falling.
It can be noted that there has been a slew of reports lately about a stronger recovery being underway after the jolt caused by the pandemic. The government expects the GDP to contract 7.7% in financial year 2021 because of the reverses.
“The bad news is that the continued drop in our BofA India Activity Indicator reinforces our view that the economy still remains weak,” the brokerage said in a note.
The indicator fell by 0.6% in November on top of the 0.8% decline in October, and 4.6% drop in the September quarter, it said, adding, “this supports our call of GVA (gross value added) contractions of 1% in the December quarter and 6.7% in FY21.”
The credit growth for FY22 will come at 12%, it said. It can be noted that credit growth had been declining for the last few years, in sync with a dip in the overall economic growth which has been on a downward spiral since demonetisation in late 2016 as borrowers went slow on expansion.
The real lending rates adjusted for WPI will be one of the prime reasons for the faster credit growth estimate in financial year 2022, the brokerage said.

“The condition of the Indian economy is on shaky ground. After witnessing the present [growth] data, just can’t be sure about it [revival of economy in the near future]. In the last five-six years, we could at least witness some growth, but now that assurance is also gone,” Mr. Banerjee told a news channel from the U.S.
  The 58-year-old economist, who bagged the coveted prize jointly with his wife Esther Duflo and another economist Michael Kremer for his “experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”, said he never thought he would get a Nobel so early in his career.
“I have been doing this research for the last twenty years. We have tried offering solutions towards alleviation of poverty,” Mr. Banerjee, who is currently the Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said.

Mr. Panagariya, in an interview to PTI , however also emphasised that the country needs to conquer COVID-19 as quickly and decisively as possible.
""Here the news on vaccination front is excellent. I only wish that we as citizens do our bit and religiously wear masks when coming in contact with others,"" he said.
""In the third as well as fourth quarter of 2020-21, real GDP had already crossed pre-Covid-19 level... these facts tell me that the fundamentals of the economy are sound,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Indian economy grew by a record 20.1% in the April-June quarter this fiscal, helped by a very weak base of last year and a sharp rebound in the manufacturing and services sectors in spite of a devastating second wave of COVID-19.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered the country's growth projection for the current financial year to 9.5 % from 10.5% estimated earlier, while the World Bank has projected India's economy to grow at 8.3% in 2021.
Mr. Panagariya, a professor of economics at Columbia University pointed out that contrary to the general impression, private investment in India has certainly already picked up.
""In both Q3 and Q4 of FY21, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) at 33% and 34.3% of GDP, respectively, was higher than in the corresponding (pre-Covid-19) quarters a year earlier,"" he said.
Replying to a question on foreign capital inflows, the eminent economist said, “Let us be clear that they have not resulted just from quantitative easing (QE)”
""True, QE encourages capital to move out of the advanced economies but that does not guarantee that it will come to India and not go to other emerging market economies,"" he said adding that it chooses India because of the high returns that the Indian economy promises.
As tapering happens in the advanced economies, Mr. Panagariya said the threat of some reversal naturally remains though the final outcome will depend on how much higher the returns in India remain relative to those in the advanced economies.
On the stock market boom at a time when economic growth has slowed down, he said there may be a disconnect but not necessarily.
Noting that stock market prices are driven by the expectations of future returns, he said, ""Given the high potential of the Indian economy, what we see in terms of high stock prices may well be a rational response by equity investors."" On recent calls for using the huge Forex reserves for infrastructure development or recapitalisation of public sector banks, the eminent economist said he generally does not approve of mixing up monetary policy and RBI FX operations with fiscal policy.
According to Mr. Panagariya, whatever funds that flow from the RBI to the government should be done transparently in terms of the usual annual transfers out of RBI earnings. Noting that the ability of the RBI to defend the exchange rate in the presence of large capital flows depends on its FX reserves, he said, ""As a rule, we should restrain from undermining this ability by raiding the FX reserves for fiscal purposes.""
Asked if high CPI and WPI inflation is a matter of concern, Mr. Panagariya said indeed, at a time when the economy is still in the recovery phase, inflation in the range of 6 % is a good thing.
""Profits of firms and expenditures and revenues of the government are measured in nominal terms and slightly higher inflation helps healthy growth in them at a time when the economy is operating at less than full capacity,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya observed that the 4% target with a 2% band around it should not be seen as a mandate to hold inflation always below 4%.
Asked what fiscal measures are necessary to support households in distress, he said India's social safety nets have expanded significantly in the last one and a half decades.
""I do not see how we can borrow more even when the goal is as noble as helping the poor without putting the burden on the future generations through increased debt,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya suggested, ""If we must expand social safety nets further at current levels of income, I would favour further rejigging of the existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor."" India has recently rejigged existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor, for example, diverting LPG subsidy from urban households to rural BPL households.
On the periodic labour force survey (PLFS) data, both annual and quarterly showing a marked deterioration in the quality of jobs, Mr. Panagariya said, ""We certainly need to move workers out of agriculture into industry and services. From this perspective, the reverse movement is disturbing.""
He, however, added that though, he would not read too much in the 2019-20 PLFS survey without a closer examination of what role in these estimates has played by the worker movement during March-June 2020.

88,The Hindu,Indian economy: Deja vu? But things seem better than in 2013 - The ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/deja-vu-but-things-seem-better-than-in-2013/article24910089.ece,,"Those with a long memory must be consumed by a sense of deja vu over developments in the past few weeks. In many ways, the present turbulent times are reminiscent of what happened in 2013.
The rupee was in a tailspin. Oil prices were booming at over $110 a barrel, exerting upward pressure on domestic retail prices of petroleum products. The current account deficit was in dangerous territory at 4.8% and the country was headed for general elections in a just a few months.
It is almost a repeat now even if some of the macro numbers are not as dramatically negative as they were then.
These are without doubt challenging times but the picture is not as dismal as it was in 2013. And that’s because of three major factors.
First and most important, growth is on the ascendant. The economy seems to have shrugged off the twin shocks from the note ban and introduction of the GST. Admittedly, the 8.1% GDP growth in the first quarter of this fiscal was amplified by the lower base in the same period last year when manufacturers slowed down ahead of the introduction of GST. But there is no mistaking the strong underlying growth impulse supported by a return of consumer spending.
Fiscal management
Second, attribute it to deft fiscal management by the Centre or to the dividends from the soft oil price regime of the last four years , the fiscal deficit is at a very respectable level of 3.3-3.5%. In comparison, the deficit in fiscal 2013 was 4.9% and in 2014 was 4.5%.
Finally, the political leadership does seem conscious of its fiscal responsibility; at least, it has been so until now. Despite calls from several quarters to loosen purse strings and cast aside the fiscal deficit marker, the Centre has refused to do so. At most, it has allowed itself the luxury of postponing the date of meeting that magic level of 3% to 2021. The temptation to step on the expenditure pedal will undoubtedly be high in an election year but we have not seen any indications of that until now.
The Centre’s reaction to the twin shocks of the rupee fall and rise in oil prices are instructive. Even as the media has been going to town over new highs in petrol prices ever day and demanding a cut in excise duty, the Centre has remained unmoved and allowed the higher prices to pass through. With almost a quarter of the Centre’s total revenue coming from fuel taxes, any cut will have an impact on the fiscal deficit.
Similarly, the reaction of the RBI and the Centre to the rupee’s fall has been prudent. The rupee has been allowed to find its natural level and the central bank has stepped in only to smooth volatility; no reactionary measures such as forex deposits swap or restrictions on capital outflows as in 2013. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may be anxious but he has exhibited none of it in public as he held on to the refrain that the rupee is not alone in its predicament and that global factors are more responsible for the weakness than domestic ones.
So, do all these mean that there’s nothing to worry about? Certainly not.
The biggest risks are external and how they will play out domestically. The combined impact of elevated oil prices and a weak rupee can cause serious damage to the economy. The pass-through of higher fuel prices is sure to push up retail inflation; the impact may be seen as early as in the August print expected tomorrow. This could prompt the RBI to front load its second rate hike for this fiscal as early as in October.
Private consumption spending, which rose to 8.6% in the first quarter of this fiscal giving a boost to overall growth might well suffer a reverse as consumers pull back from the twin shocks of rising fuel prices and higher interest rates. This will have adverse consequences for GDP growth especially given that private investment is still to fully recover.
Second, the RBI may have let the rupee fall until now but indications are a further fall will be defended, which means a drain on forex reserves. The Centre may also be forced to step in and cut taxes on fuels with obvious implications for the fisc.
Finally, there is no saying what one Donald Trump would do next. The tariff war that he has set off has thrown challenges for India as well. In sum, these are piquant times indeed for the economy.
Update
A number of readers have pointed out that the new series GDP data should have been taken for comparison in both time periods, Q1 2013-14 and Q1 2018-19. The analysis in the article holds even if we take the new series data. As per the new series, growth in the first quarter of 2013-14 was 6.4 per cent, still substantially lower than the latest quarter's growth

On the positive side, the brokerage said credit demand is bottoming out and the real lending rates, adjusted for wholesale price inflation, are falling.
It can be noted that there has been a slew of reports lately about a stronger recovery being underway after the jolt caused by the pandemic. The government expects the GDP to contract 7.7% in financial year 2021 because of the reverses.
“The bad news is that the continued drop in our BofA India Activity Indicator reinforces our view that the economy still remains weak,” the brokerage said in a note.
The indicator fell by 0.6% in November on top of the 0.8% decline in October, and 4.6% drop in the September quarter, it said, adding, “this supports our call of GVA (gross value added) contractions of 1% in the December quarter and 6.7% in FY21.”
The credit growth for FY22 will come at 12%, it said. It can be noted that credit growth had been declining for the last few years, in sync with a dip in the overall economic growth which has been on a downward spiral since demonetisation in late 2016 as borrowers went slow on expansion.
The real lending rates adjusted for WPI will be one of the prime reasons for the faster credit growth estimate in financial year 2022, the brokerage said.

Mr. Panagariya, in an interview to PTI , however also emphasised that the country needs to conquer COVID-19 as quickly and decisively as possible.
""Here the news on vaccination front is excellent. I only wish that we as citizens do our bit and religiously wear masks when coming in contact with others,"" he said.
""In the third as well as fourth quarter of 2020-21, real GDP had already crossed pre-Covid-19 level... these facts tell me that the fundamentals of the economy are sound,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Indian economy grew by a record 20.1% in the April-June quarter this fiscal, helped by a very weak base of last year and a sharp rebound in the manufacturing and services sectors in spite of a devastating second wave of COVID-19.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered the country's growth projection for the current financial year to 9.5 % from 10.5% estimated earlier, while the World Bank has projected India's economy to grow at 8.3% in 2021.
Mr. Panagariya, a professor of economics at Columbia University pointed out that contrary to the general impression, private investment in India has certainly already picked up.
""In both Q3 and Q4 of FY21, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) at 33% and 34.3% of GDP, respectively, was higher than in the corresponding (pre-Covid-19) quarters a year earlier,"" he said.
Replying to a question on foreign capital inflows, the eminent economist said, “Let us be clear that they have not resulted just from quantitative easing (QE)”
""True, QE encourages capital to move out of the advanced economies but that does not guarantee that it will come to India and not go to other emerging market economies,"" he said adding that it chooses India because of the high returns that the Indian economy promises.
As tapering happens in the advanced economies, Mr. Panagariya said the threat of some reversal naturally remains though the final outcome will depend on how much higher the returns in India remain relative to those in the advanced economies.
On the stock market boom at a time when economic growth has slowed down, he said there may be a disconnect but not necessarily.
Noting that stock market prices are driven by the expectations of future returns, he said, ""Given the high potential of the Indian economy, what we see in terms of high stock prices may well be a rational response by equity investors."" On recent calls for using the huge Forex reserves for infrastructure development or recapitalisation of public sector banks, the eminent economist said he generally does not approve of mixing up monetary policy and RBI FX operations with fiscal policy.
According to Mr. Panagariya, whatever funds that flow from the RBI to the government should be done transparently in terms of the usual annual transfers out of RBI earnings. Noting that the ability of the RBI to defend the exchange rate in the presence of large capital flows depends on its FX reserves, he said, ""As a rule, we should restrain from undermining this ability by raiding the FX reserves for fiscal purposes.""
Asked if high CPI and WPI inflation is a matter of concern, Mr. Panagariya said indeed, at a time when the economy is still in the recovery phase, inflation in the range of 6 % is a good thing.
""Profits of firms and expenditures and revenues of the government are measured in nominal terms and slightly higher inflation helps healthy growth in them at a time when the economy is operating at less than full capacity,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya observed that the 4% target with a 2% band around it should not be seen as a mandate to hold inflation always below 4%.
Asked what fiscal measures are necessary to support households in distress, he said India's social safety nets have expanded significantly in the last one and a half decades.
""I do not see how we can borrow more even when the goal is as noble as helping the poor without putting the burden on the future generations through increased debt,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya suggested, ""If we must expand social safety nets further at current levels of income, I would favour further rejigging of the existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor."" India has recently rejigged existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor, for example, diverting LPG subsidy from urban households to rural BPL households.
On the periodic labour force survey (PLFS) data, both annual and quarterly showing a marked deterioration in the quality of jobs, Mr. Panagariya said, ""We certainly need to move workers out of agriculture into industry and services. From this perspective, the reverse movement is disturbing.""
He, however, added that though, he would not read too much in the 2019-20 PLFS survey without a closer examination of what role in these estimates has played by the worker movement during March-June 2020.

108,The Hindu,Indian economy: Deja vu? But things seem better than in 2013 - The ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/deja-vu-but-things-seem-better-than-in-2013/article24910089.ece,,"Those with a long memory must be consumed by a sense of deja vu over developments in the past few weeks. In many ways, the present turbulent times are reminiscent of what happened in 2013.
The rupee was in a tailspin. Oil prices were booming at over $110 a barrel, exerting upward pressure on domestic retail prices of petroleum products. The current account deficit was in dangerous territory at 4.8% and the country was headed for general elections in a just a few months.
It is almost a repeat now even if some of the macro numbers are not as dramatically negative as they were then.
These are without doubt challenging times but the picture is not as dismal as it was in 2013. And that’s because of three major factors.
First and most important, growth is on the ascendant. The economy seems to have shrugged off the twin shocks from the note ban and introduction of the GST. Admittedly, the 8.1% GDP growth in the first quarter of this fiscal was amplified by the lower base in the same period last year when manufacturers slowed down ahead of the introduction of GST. But there is no mistaking the strong underlying growth impulse supported by a return of consumer spending.
Fiscal management
Second, attribute it to deft fiscal management by the Centre or to the dividends from the soft oil price regime of the last four years , the fiscal deficit is at a very respectable level of 3.3-3.5%. In comparison, the deficit in fiscal 2013 was 4.9% and in 2014 was 4.5%.
Finally, the political leadership does seem conscious of its fiscal responsibility; at least, it has been so until now. Despite calls from several quarters to loosen purse strings and cast aside the fiscal deficit marker, the Centre has refused to do so. At most, it has allowed itself the luxury of postponing the date of meeting that magic level of 3% to 2021. The temptation to step on the expenditure pedal will undoubtedly be high in an election year but we have not seen any indications of that until now.
The Centre’s reaction to the twin shocks of the rupee fall and rise in oil prices are instructive. Even as the media has been going to town over new highs in petrol prices ever day and demanding a cut in excise duty, the Centre has remained unmoved and allowed the higher prices to pass through. With almost a quarter of the Centre’s total revenue coming from fuel taxes, any cut will have an impact on the fiscal deficit.
Similarly, the reaction of the RBI and the Centre to the rupee’s fall has been prudent. The rupee has been allowed to find its natural level and the central bank has stepped in only to smooth volatility; no reactionary measures such as forex deposits swap or restrictions on capital outflows as in 2013. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may be anxious but he has exhibited none of it in public as he held on to the refrain that the rupee is not alone in its predicament and that global factors are more responsible for the weakness than domestic ones.
So, do all these mean that there’s nothing to worry about? Certainly not.
The biggest risks are external and how they will play out domestically. The combined impact of elevated oil prices and a weak rupee can cause serious damage to the economy. The pass-through of higher fuel prices is sure to push up retail inflation; the impact may be seen as early as in the August print expected tomorrow. This could prompt the RBI to front load its second rate hike for this fiscal as early as in October.
Private consumption spending, which rose to 8.6% in the first quarter of this fiscal giving a boost to overall growth might well suffer a reverse as consumers pull back from the twin shocks of rising fuel prices and higher interest rates. This will have adverse consequences for GDP growth especially given that private investment is still to fully recover.
Second, the RBI may have let the rupee fall until now but indications are a further fall will be defended, which means a drain on forex reserves. The Centre may also be forced to step in and cut taxes on fuels with obvious implications for the fisc.
Finally, there is no saying what one Donald Trump would do next. The tariff war that he has set off has thrown challenges for India as well. In sum, these are piquant times indeed for the economy.
Update
A number of readers have pointed out that the new series GDP data should have been taken for comparison in both time periods, Q1 2013-14 and Q1 2018-19. The analysis in the article holds even if we take the new series data. As per the new series, growth in the first quarter of 2013-14 was 6.4 per cent, still substantially lower than the latest quarter's growth

On the positive side, the brokerage said credit demand is bottoming out and the real lending rates, adjusted for wholesale price inflation, are falling.
It can be noted that there has been a slew of reports lately about a stronger recovery being underway after the jolt caused by the pandemic. The government expects the GDP to contract 7.7% in financial year 2021 because of the reverses.
“The bad news is that the continued drop in our BofA India Activity Indicator reinforces our view that the economy still remains weak,” the brokerage said in a note.
The indicator fell by 0.6% in November on top of the 0.8% decline in October, and 4.6% drop in the September quarter, it said, adding, “this supports our call of GVA (gross value added) contractions of 1% in the December quarter and 6.7% in FY21.”
The credit growth for FY22 will come at 12%, it said. It can be noted that credit growth had been declining for the last few years, in sync with a dip in the overall economic growth which has been on a downward spiral since demonetisation in late 2016 as borrowers went slow on expansion.
The real lending rates adjusted for WPI will be one of the prime reasons for the faster credit growth estimate in financial year 2022, the brokerage said.

127,The Hindu,Indian economy's fundamentals strong; private investment picking ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economys-fundamentals-strong-private-investment-picking-up-arvind-panagariya/article36803563.ece,,"The fundamentals of the Indian economy are sound as the real GDP in Q3 and Q4 of FY'21 already crossed the pre-pandemic level, former NITI Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya said on Sunday.
Mr. Panagariya, in an interview to PTI , however also emphasised that the country needs to conquer COVID-19 as quickly and decisively as possible.
""Here the news on vaccination front is excellent. I only wish that we as citizens do our bit and religiously wear masks when coming in contact with others,"" he said.
""In the third as well as fourth quarter of 2020-21, real GDP had already crossed pre-Covid-19 level... these facts tell me that the fundamentals of the economy are sound,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Indian economy grew by a record 20.1% in the April-June quarter this fiscal, helped by a very weak base of last year and a sharp rebound in the manufacturing and services sectors in spite of a devastating second wave of COVID-19.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered the country's growth projection for the current financial year to 9.5 % from 10.5% estimated earlier, while the World Bank has projected India's economy to grow at 8.3% in 2021.
Mr. Panagariya, a professor of economics at Columbia University pointed out that contrary to the general impression, private investment in India has certainly already picked up.
""In both Q3 and Q4 of FY21, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) at 33% and 34.3% of GDP, respectively, was higher than in the corresponding (pre-Covid-19) quarters a year earlier,"" he said.
Replying to a question on foreign capital inflows, the eminent economist said, “Let us be clear that they have not resulted just from quantitative easing (QE)”
""True, QE encourages capital to move out of the advanced economies but that does not guarantee that it will come to India and not go to other emerging market economies,"" he said adding that it chooses India because of the high returns that the Indian economy promises.
As tapering happens in the advanced economies, Mr. Panagariya said the threat of some reversal naturally remains though the final outcome will depend on how much higher the returns in India remain relative to those in the advanced economies.
On the stock market boom at a time when economic growth has slowed down, he said there may be a disconnect but not necessarily.
Noting that stock market prices are driven by the expectations of future returns, he said, ""Given the high potential of the Indian economy, what we see in terms of high stock prices may well be a rational response by equity investors."" On recent calls for using the huge Forex reserves for infrastructure development or recapitalisation of public sector banks, the eminent economist said he generally does not approve of mixing up monetary policy and RBI FX operations with fiscal policy.
According to Mr. Panagariya, whatever funds that flow from the RBI to the government should be done transparently in terms of the usual annual transfers out of RBI earnings. Noting that the ability of the RBI to defend the exchange rate in the presence of large capital flows depends on its FX reserves, he said, ""As a rule, we should restrain from undermining this ability by raiding the FX reserves for fiscal purposes.""
Asked if high CPI and WPI inflation is a matter of concern, Mr. Panagariya said indeed, at a time when the economy is still in the recovery phase, inflation in the range of 6 % is a good thing.
""Profits of firms and expenditures and revenues of the government are measured in nominal terms and slightly higher inflation helps healthy growth in them at a time when the economy is operating at less than full capacity,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya observed that the 4% target with a 2% band around it should not be seen as a mandate to hold inflation always below 4%.
Asked what fiscal measures are necessary to support households in distress, he said India's social safety nets have expanded significantly in the last one and a half decades.
""I do not see how we can borrow more even when the goal is as noble as helping the poor without putting the burden on the future generations through increased debt,"" he said.
Mr. Panagariya suggested, ""If we must expand social safety nets further at current levels of income, I would favour further rejigging of the existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor."" India has recently rejigged existing subsidies from richer recipients to the poor, for example, diverting LPG subsidy from urban households to rural BPL households.
On the periodic labour force survey (PLFS) data, both annual and quarterly showing a marked deterioration in the quality of jobs, Mr. Panagariya said, ""We certainly need to move workers out of agriculture into industry and services. From this perspective, the reverse movement is disturbing.""
He, however, added that though, he would not read too much in the 2019-20 PLFS survey without a closer examination of what role in these estimates has played by the worker movement during March-June 2020.

128,The Hindu,Indian economy: Deja vu? But things seem better than in 2013 - The ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/deja-vu-but-things-seem-better-than-in-2013/article24910089.ece,,"Those with a long memory must be consumed by a sense of deja vu over developments in the past few weeks. In many ways, the present turbulent times are reminiscent of what happened in 2013.
The rupee was in a tailspin. Oil prices were booming at over $110 a barrel, exerting upward pressure on domestic retail prices of petroleum products. The current account deficit was in dangerous territory at 4.8% and the country was headed for general elections in a just a few months.
It is almost a repeat now even if some of the macro numbers are not as dramatically negative as they were then.
These are without doubt challenging times but the picture is not as dismal as it was in 2013. And that’s because of three major factors.
First and most important, growth is on the ascendant. The economy seems to have shrugged off the twin shocks from the note ban and introduction of the GST. Admittedly, the 8.1% GDP growth in the first quarter of this fiscal was amplified by the lower base in the same period last year when manufacturers slowed down ahead of the introduction of GST. But there is no mistaking the strong underlying growth impulse supported by a return of consumer spending.
Fiscal management
Second, attribute it to deft fiscal management by the Centre or to the dividends from the soft oil price regime of the last four years , the fiscal deficit is at a very respectable level of 3.3-3.5%. In comparison, the deficit in fiscal 2013 was 4.9% and in 2014 was 4.5%.
Finally, the political leadership does seem conscious of its fiscal responsibility; at least, it has been so until now. Despite calls from several quarters to loosen purse strings and cast aside the fiscal deficit marker, the Centre has refused to do so. At most, it has allowed itself the luxury of postponing the date of meeting that magic level of 3% to 2021. The temptation to step on the expenditure pedal will undoubtedly be high in an election year but we have not seen any indications of that until now.
The Centre’s reaction to the twin shocks of the rupee fall and rise in oil prices are instructive. Even as the media has been going to town over new highs in petrol prices ever day and demanding a cut in excise duty, the Centre has remained unmoved and allowed the higher prices to pass through. With almost a quarter of the Centre’s total revenue coming from fuel taxes, any cut will have an impact on the fiscal deficit.
Similarly, the reaction of the RBI and the Centre to the rupee’s fall has been prudent. The rupee has been allowed to find its natural level and the central bank has stepped in only to smooth volatility; no reactionary measures such as forex deposits swap or restrictions on capital outflows as in 2013. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may be anxious but he has exhibited none of it in public as he held on to the refrain that the rupee is not alone in its predicament and that global factors are more responsible for the weakness than domestic ones.
So, do all these mean that there’s nothing to worry about? Certainly not.
The biggest risks are external and how they will play out domestically. The combined impact of elevated oil prices and a weak rupee can cause serious damage to the economy. The pass-through of higher fuel prices is sure to push up retail inflation; the impact may be seen as early as in the August print expected tomorrow. This could prompt the RBI to front load its second rate hike for this fiscal as early as in October.
Private consumption spending, which rose to 8.6% in the first quarter of this fiscal giving a boost to overall growth might well suffer a reverse as consumers pull back from the twin shocks of rising fuel prices and higher interest rates. This will have adverse consequences for GDP growth especially given that private investment is still to fully recover.
Second, the RBI may have let the rupee fall until now but indications are a further fall will be defended, which means a drain on forex reserves. The Centre may also be forced to step in and cut taxes on fuels with obvious implications for the fisc.
Finally, there is no saying what one Donald Trump would do next. The tariff war that he has set off has thrown challenges for India as well. In sum, these are piquant times indeed for the economy.
Update
A number of readers have pointed out that the new series GDP data should have been taken for comparison in both time periods, Q1 2013-14 and Q1 2018-19. The analysis in the article holds even if we take the new series data. As per the new series, growth in the first quarter of 2013-14 was 6.4 per cent, still substantially lower than the latest quarter's growth
