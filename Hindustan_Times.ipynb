Unlike the in-person summit in September, an outcome document such as a leaders’ declaration is not expected at the virtual summit.\\nIndia holds the G20 presidency until November 30.

He also emphasizes the US's competition with China, highlighting the IMEC as a challenge to China's Belt & Road Initiative. Biden reaffirms commitment to the Quad and expresses anticipation for the Quad Leaders' Summit in India. He discusses the need for a better future in the region, integrating Israel while considering the aspirations of the Palestinian people.\\nUS President Joe Biden has drawn a direct link between Hamas’s terror attack against Israel with the US-led efforts at regional integration in West Asia, hinting at the process to establish diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia-Israel and projects such as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) as possible triggers for the conflagration in West Asia.\\nHT Image\\nBiden also said that the US will continue to compete with China, pointing specifically to IMEC in the context of challenging the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI). He hailed Quad as a mechanism that will contribute to peace and said he looked forward to attending the Quad Leaders’ Summit in India next year.\\nWe're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.\\nBiden was speaking along with visiting Australian PM Anthony Albanese at the White House, where the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific and Aukus, the Australia-US-UK nuclear submarine deal that requires US Congress to pass the relevant legislation.\\nSpeaking on the Israel-Hamas war, Biden said that he had spoken to several regional leaders, from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, and Egypt in recent days, “about making sure there is real hope in the region for a better future; about the need – and I mean this sincerely – about the need to work toward a greater integration for Israel while insisting that the aspirations of the Palestinian people will be part of that future as well”.\\n“I am convinced one of the reasons Hamas attacked when they did – and I have no proof of this; just my instinct tells me – is because of the progress we were making towards regional integration for Israel and regional integration overall. And we can’t leave that work behind.” On the day of the attacks, HT, in an analysis piece, had written about how the Hamas attacks appear motivated by a desire to ignite an Israeli response that would make it much harder, if not impossible, for its Arab neighbours to continue with the process of normalisation.\\nIn recent years, the geopolitical landscape in West Asia has changed with the Abraham Accords between Israel and a set of its Arab neighbours, and intense negotiations between US, Israel and Saudi Arabia to establish normal diplomatic ties between Tel Aviv and Riyadh. It has also taken two new institutional forms which involve India, with the I2U2 coalition (of India, Israel, US and UAE) and the ambitious IMEC announcement during the G20 Summit which envisages rail and shipping corridors from India through West Asia all the way to Europe.\\nBiden, who had referred to the project during a speech last week as evidence of what US was attempting to do in the region, specifically mentioned IMEC in the context of China in his remarks on Wednesday.\\nAsked if Australia can trust China in the context of Albanese’s trip to China next week, Biden said: “Trust but verify is the phrase. And, look, China is having their own internal and external difficulties right now. China’s economic growth is stagnant compared to what it was. China has engaged in activities that Russia and many others have engaged in terms of intimidation and dealing with other countries.”\\nThe Biden administration is engaging with Beijing as well, and China’s foreign minister Wang Yi is currently in Washington.\\nBiden said Xi Jinping knew that the US would compete with China on BRI, which had been a “a debt and a noose for most of the people that signed on”. He then referred to US’s own efforts on infrastructure with G7 countries, and mentioned IMEC. Biden said that the US was a “reliable partner”, and in his conversation with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi leader had expressed his desire for “reconciliation”. “It’s the idea that you’d have the nations of the Middle East cooperating economically and politically changes the dynamics significantly. And so, I just think that it it’s something that it’s in everyone’s interest – including, long-term, in China’s interest.”\\nOn a separate note, while hailing the US-Australia relationship as an anchor of peace an anchor of peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, Biden said, “We see this through our work of the Quad partners – India and Japan – to ensure the Indo-Pacific remains free, open, prosperous, and secure.”\\nBiden said that China neither liked Aukus nor Quad. Claiming that Xi had asked him why the US was trying to “surround China”, Biden said, said he had told him that US wasn’t surrounding China. “We are just making sure that the sea lanes remain open, he doesn’t unilaterally... change the rules of the road in terms of what constitutes international airspace and water space, et cetera. And so, that’s what this is all about.” Biden added that the Quad was a “very important piece” too. “It’s about maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait, the Indian Ocean, that whole area. And I think it’s going to increase the prospects for long-term peace rather than do anything else.”\\nGet Latest India News along with Latest News and Top Headlines from India and around the world\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\nPrashant Jha\\nPrashant Jha is the Washington DC-based US correspondent of Hindustan Times.

(ANI)\\n“About three weeks ago, I was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. I must share with you that the G20 was very much the subject of conversation. A lot of people were still a little surprised that the G20 could bridge what were strong positions and deep divides,” he said at a G20 tree plantation ceremony at Nehru Park in Delhi.\\nWe're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.\\nThe G20 member states adopted a consensus leaders’ declaration for their summit in Delhi last month after prolonged negotiations on the outcome document that had been held up over a reference to the Ukraine crisis.\\n“Many other countries also took particular satisfaction at the permanent membership of the African Union at the G20. But overall, there was a sense in global diplomacy that this G20 actually delivered very substantively on what were the most pressing issues of the day. It turned out far better than most people expected,” the minister said.\\nIndia achieved a consensus on the historic Delhi Declaration of the G20 by leveraging diplomacy, goodwill, personal relationships, and straightforward messaging, as previously reported by HT. India told the West that flexibility over terminology on Russia’s aggression in Ukraine would help G20 arrive at a declaration. It also indicated that if the Indian presidency failed in the quest, not only did the summit risk being a failure, but there was also a bigger risk of China’s efforts to carve out an alternative international power structure gaining traction.\\n“As we bask in the afterglow of the Summit (G20), I am often asked - tell me what did you really get done? When I look at what we got done, to me the four-five key takeaways were the action plan for the SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) which directly fed into the SDG Summit which happened after the G20 - the Green Development Pact, the message of women-led development, the support for digital public infrastructure, the LiFE Mission. At the end of it all, there was a very strong sustainability, green, global south image that came out of the G20,” Jaishankar said.\\nGet Latest India News along with Latest News and Top Headlines from India and around the world\\nTOPICS\\nG20 Summit\"}, '6': {'id': 6, 'publisher': 'Hinduatan Times', 'title': 'India writing new saga of progress: Modi', 'link': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-writing-new-saga-of-progress-modi-101697795398469.html', 'publish_details': 'Oct 20, 2023 03:19 PM IST', 'content': \"India writing new saga of progress: Modi\\nBySaptarshi Das\\nOct 20, 2023 03:19 PM IST\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi was speaking at the inauguration of the 17-km priority section of the country’s first Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday cited the hosting of the summit of the leaders of the world’s 20 big economies in New Delhi, the landing of Indian spacecraft on the moon’s unexplored South Pole, and successes of Indian athletes at the Asian Games and said India was writing a new saga of progress in every sector.\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi.

The UAE was present at the Delhi G20 summit where it watched, as an invitee, the discussions on issues of climate, energy and sustainable development. Even as the relevant paragraphs of the G20 declaration were being negotiated, certain quarters expected that the G20 would agree on a phase-down of fossil fuels including coal, oil and gas by a certain time frame. If agreed, the UAE would have been impacted much like the other oil and coal-producing countries within the G20. However, the final text of the declaration disappointed those who bet on it.\\nPREMIUM\\nFILE PHOTO: 'Cop28 UAE' logo is displayed on the screen during the opening ceremony of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) under the theme of 'United on Climate Action Toward COP28', in Abu Dhabi, UAE, January 16, 2023. REUTERS/Rula Rouhana/File Photo(REUTERS)\\nThe declaration calls for the adoption of policies that help transition towards low-emission energy systems and rapid scaling up of clean power generation. This includes accelerated efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power within the framework of national circumstances, which is the language agreed upon at the Bali summit.\\nThere is also a reference to low or zero-emission technologies which implies enhanced levels of renewable energy, energy efficiency, biofuels, hydrogen, nuclear and hydel energy as well as abatement and removal technologies. A specific reference to oil and gas phase-down is, however, missing.\\nIt is argued that expansion of a “phase-down” from coal to all fossil fuels would have been in India’s interest as it would have widened the circle of commitments for all. Many also believe that the UAE has a moral responsibility to push such a phase-down not only because it is the leader of the next climate conference but also because it is a large contributor to global emissions on a per capita basis.\\nOthers argue that fossil phase-out is absolutely necessary to achieve a 43% reduction of emissions from 2019 levels by 2030, a goal endorsed by the G20.\\nThese arguments miss the finer points involved in attempting global sustainability while pursuing national strategy. The reluctance to expand the Bali (G20 summit) language on phase-down is partly explained by the fact that the G20 consists of several oil, gas and coal-producing countries. When it comes to climate, the group dynamics in the countries of South and North are totally different.\\nThe G20 declaration calls for the developed countries to take the lead in emissions reduction. If the modelled pathways for peaking of global emissions by 2025 are to be followed strictly, the developed country members should have reduced their emissions to near zero by now. All such countries had reached their peak in 1990 but the reductions thereafter have progressed at a snail’s pace.\\nIt is common knowledge that in many countries of the Global North, emissions are still rising rather than falling. It is hence difficult to agree on a responsibility framework where the burden of future fossil fuel production or consumption falls squarely on the Global South.\\nFor a consensus to emerge on this issue, one has to wait for the outcome of the Global Stocktake (GST) of the progress made towards reaching global goals and the impact of actions by various countries.\\nThe first GST initiated under the Paris Agreement in 2020 is poised to conclude in Dubai. Early feedback from the first GST indicates that the world is not on track to contain the emissions as required and that system transformation across all economic sectors is the only way to ensure low emission growth without causing economic and social loss.\\nThe G20 has made some useful suggestions on how to scale up finance for low-emission system transformation. It has called for greater involvement of multilateral development banks (MDBs) in sustainable finance.\\nThat MDBs like the World Bank may leverage their capital base to involve other stakeholders in mobilising green finance is a positive development.\\nFor a change, the G20 has agreed on a global target of tripling renewable energy capacity in the interest of faster energy transition. It has recognised that withdrawal from coal or oil is linked to the deployment of renewable energy on scale within the grid-based energy system.\\nIndia should be happy with this development as it has sufficient lead in this field over other G20 members. A similar target of doubling energy efficiency means that small and medium industries, which are the mainstay of the industrial supply chain and contribute to 30% of emissions, can receive financing for efficiency measures. A consensus on incorporating these targets in national goals in Dubai would be a gain for the global climate process.\\nOil companies that contribute to fossil fuel emissions emphasise the role of carbon capture and storage for stabilisation of emissions in the oil and gas industry. While India has generally remained suspicious of such fancy technologies in the power sector because of their inherent cost and doubts about technical feasibility, it appears that oil-producing economies would rely on this technology to some extent until they diversify their economies. G20 has talked about access to abatement and removal technologies in the long term even as measures are taken to scale up renewable energy in the medium term.\\nUnfortunately, technological progress in this regard is slow in this area. Hopefully, initiatives like the Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre in the International Solar Alliance and Biofuel Alliance may advance the pace of future actions.\\nAt COP28, there will be several other emotive issues relating to funds for loss and damage and adaptation financing that will compete for the attention of the presidency. The UAE will have to ensure that these issues of immediate importance are not lost at the altar of future transition.\\nRR Rashmi is distinguished fellow at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and former lead climate negotiator.

It is a matter of pride that this summit concluded with a joint declaration strengthening our concept of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” — One Earth, One Family, One Future. G20 also underlined India’s growing global influence, as it successfully played the role of a consensus builder. Coming on the heels of the G20 Summit, the Parliament of India is getting ready to host another important congregation, i.e. the P20 or the G20 Parliamentary Speakers’ Summit on October 13 and 14 in New Delhi. P20 brings together the Speakers or the Presiding Officers of Parliaments of G20 and invitee nations.\\nOur Parliament has presented a model of meaningful discussion and dialogue to the world (ANI)\\nParliament is the supreme legislative body of every nation, through which public representatives present aspirations and expectations of people in the Houses and formulate laws and policies. India is an ancient civilisation with a rich cultural heritage. Democracy has been an ingrained concept in India for ages. Even in our ancient texts, there is mention of participatory institutions such as sabha and samiti, which existed as public representative institutions in the Vedic age. Democracy, diversity and demography have been our strengths in our 75-year journey since Independence. With the power of democracy, we have created harmony among all sections of society and ensured social and economic development for all. People-centric, inclusive development is at the centre of our democratic journey. Even in our Parliament, public representatives form a collective view on issues after extensive discussion. This helps us find collective solutions to challenges.\\nWe're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.\\nTherefore, in the P20 conference also, the Parliament of India will try to develop a common vision to address the important contemporary issues facing the world and humanity. The importance of organising the P20 Conclave in India increases because the consensus on global issues is related to the common future of humanity. The focus of the P20 conference will be on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the climate crisis, women-led development and the shared future of humanity. It will also discuss topics related to Lifestyle for Environment i.e. Mission LiFE, India’s contribution to the lexicon of managing the climate crisis.\\nSustainable Development Goals: The SDGs have certainly given impetus to efforts to realise the concept of holistic human development in the world. As we approach 2030, it becomes even more important to assess the achievements made under this initiative and accelerate efforts to realise them. Among the SDGs, there are many whose impact is universal. There is a need to discuss these issues in parliaments and build consensus to eliminate all contradictions. Policy consensus needs to be developed while maintaining the sovereignty of nations.\\nTowards a green future: India has attempted to adapt its development process to the needs of a green future even while facing the challenges of a huge population and maintaining the aspiration of becoming a developed nation. Today, India is in a leadership role in the field of alternative energy. Policy initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance and Global Biofuel Alliance championed by India have received wide global support. Environment-related issues have also been discussed continuously in our Parliament. Through this dialogue, a consensus has been formed in the country on policy-making for renewable energy beyond political differences.\\nWomen empowerment to women-led development: Women have been considered the embodiment of power and devotion in India’s ancient culture. Women have proved their capability and strength in all fields, be it science and technology, defence, space science or in the field of sports. Our Constitution has empowered women by giving them equal rights in all spheres, including voting rights. As our journey of democracy progressed, policy decisions were taken to provide political and economic empowerment to women and to give them leadership opportunities. Initially, laws were made for reservation for women in gram panchayat- and municipal-level elections. Taking this forward, laws have since been made for reservation for them in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies. There has been a consensus on this law among every political party in the entire country. We will share our positive experiences on this topic at the P20 conference and strive to make women-led development a global movement.\\nTransforming people’s lives through public digital platforms: India has been at the forefront of digital transformation, leveraging technology to improve the lives of its citizens. Initiatives such as Aadhaar, the world’s largest biometric identification system, have streamlined access to government services. Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has become one of the largest financial inclusion tools that brought digital banking to the masses. The Digital India programme aims to provide digital access to all citizens and is revolutionising governance at the grassroots. The lives of millions of Indians have been transformed with the adoption of digital technology across various sectors such as education, agriculture, and finance. At the P20 summit, we will share this landmark achievement with the parliaments of the world so that India’s success in digital transformation becomes a model for the entire world.\\nIndia’s Parliament has played a big role in shaping the destiny of the world’s largest democracy. Our Parliament has made public welfare laws after extensive discussion, always keeping the interests of the public in mind. Despite having a multi-party system, we have reached a consensus on issues. In this way, our Parliament has presented a model of meaningful discussion and dialogue to the world. I am confident that just as the G20 summit achieved consensus on global challenges, the P20 summit will also underline the essential role of parliaments in addressing contemporary challenges and usher in a new era of cooperation between parliaments on global issues.\\nOm Birla is Speaker of the Lok Sabha.

Africa, with 60% of the world’s uncultivated arable land, is well-positioned to feed a burgeoning global population, projected to reach 11 billion by the end of this century. Africa boasts an abundance of natural resources, including 8% of the world’s oil reserves, 7% of its natural gas, 18% of its gold, 53% of its diamonds, and 75% of its platinum.\\nThe continent leads in the production of industrial metals such as copper and iron ore, controlling approximately one-third of the world’s remaining mineral resources. Africa’s vast repositories of rare earth elements, essential for cell phones, LED screens, energy infrastructure, and defence technologies, make it a global powerhouse.\\nMore than two-thirds of the world’s cobalt, crucial for lithium-ion batteries, is found in Congo, while around 35% of the world’s bauxite, a key component in aluminium production, is located in Guinea. Africa’s demographics complement this promising picture. Seventy per cent of sub-Saharan Africa is under the age of 30, representing a market dream for companies seeking new consumers and entrepreneurial talent.\\nAfrica’s population is expected to double in the next 35 years, comprising nearly 30% of the world’s population by 2050, which would exceed the combined population of China and India. The abundance of arable land, mineral resources, demographics, and diverse cultures that attract tourists, make Africa an epicentre of tremendous opportunity.\\nHowever, it’s essential to recognise the challenges that Africa faces. In 2021, about 490 million people lived under the poverty line of 1.90 PPP$/day in Africa.\\nIn 2013, sub-Saharan Africa was home to over half of the world’s poorest people, with 389 million individuals living on less than $2 per day.\\nIn 2021, Africa contributed approximately 3.6% of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 2.7% of world exports, and 3.8% of inward foreign direct investment. UNDP estimates that growth has not been inclusive in most African economies. The climate crisis poses an increasing threat, particularly to the agricultural sector.\\nA fifth of Africans suffer from chronic hunger, exacerbated by flooding. While Africa’s contribution to global emissions remained below 3% between 1850 and 2020, the continent lost between 5% and 15% of its GDP each year due to the climate crisis. Security concerns persist, with four of the world’s six deadliest countries in Africa accounting for 77.3% of total terrorism deaths in 2021.\\nTo enable inclusive development in Africa, India’s leadership in Digital Public Infrastructure and digital financial inclusion holds immense significance. It provides an opportunity to address the digital divide and empower African nations with the knowledge and tools to embark on their digital journeys. India’s resounding success in financial inclusion through the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is a testament to the transformative power of financial access.\\nThe PMJDY has facilitated over 500 million bank accounts for marginalised individuals, demonstrating that financial inclusion is not an abstract ideal but a tangible reality. In Africa, where economic inclusion and poverty alleviation are paramount, India’s expertise in financial inclusion offers invaluable guidance. By emulating India’s achievements, African nations can extend financial services to their most vulnerable populations, unlocking economic opportunities and fostering entrepreneurship at scale. India’s success story in Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), exemplified by Aadhaar, UPI, and CoWin, is inspiring. DPI provides the rails upon which user-friendly digital products and services are built, benefiting entire populations.\\nThis infrastructure has enabled India to streamline governance, boost financial inclusion, and respond effectively to crises like the pandemic. Aadhaar, India’s biometric identification system, has provided over 1.2 billion citizens with a unique digital identity, streamlining access to government services. Unified Payment Interface (UPI) accounts for 68% of all payment transactions by volume in India.\\nIn January 2023 alone, eight billion transactions worth nearly $200 billion occurred, involving 300 million people and 50 million merchants. CoWIN, a critical component in India’s pandemic response, managed the world’s largest vaccination programme, showcasing the scalability of DPI.\\nThe economic impact of DPI is substantial, with Digital ID alone capable of unlocking economic value equivalent to 3–13% of GDP, averaging a 6% improvement for emerging economies. During the pandemic, the Indian government served its entire population of beneficiaries through digital cash transfers, compared to just 16% for other countries.\\nIn conclusion, as India welcomes the African Union to the G20 and showcases its digital prowess, it is poised to facilitate a transformative journey for Africa. India’s digital infrastructure not only has the potential to bridge the digital divide, but also to empower African nations to chart their course towards inclusive prosperity.\\nKrishnamurthy Subramanian is executive director, International Monetary Fund.

For India, Navy continues to be a force-multiplier\\nThe past year has seen India adroitly negotiating a diplomatic minefield by participating, on the one hand, in forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the BRICS alliance – both with overtly anti-western orientation – while, at the same time, upholding its deep commitment to the United States (US)-led Malabar/Quad grouping. Further endorsement of India’s diplomatic heft came with its successful presidency of the G20 summit, clearly manifest in the crafting and adoption of a consensual declaration.\\nPREMIUM\\nToday, it is China that is integrating Asia with Europe through its terrestrial network of high-speed railways, energy pipelines and fibre optic cables.(Hector Retamal / AFP)\\nIn the military domain, India has just co-hosted with the US, the 13th biennial Indo-Pacific Army Chiefs Conference (IPACC), on September 26 and 27. This was yet another significant event, which underscored India’s regional and global leadership bid and its commitment to promoting peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. With participation from 30 countries, IPACC provides a forum for the senior leadership of Indo-Pacific armies to discuss issues of mutual interest and to develop cooperative approaches.\\nIt was not very long ago that the Japanese-conceived and US-promoted “Indo-Pacific” concept found grudging acceptance in the international geopolitical and diplomatic lexicon, eventually replacing the term “Asia Pacific” and conflating (as intended) the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Having come into common usage, the Indo-Pacific has, however, retained in public perception a maritime or ocean-related connotation. This perception arises from the region’s history, geography, and economics, which bear the imprint of the oceans that have for millennia facilitated trade, transportation, and cultural intercourse, as well as foreign invasions.\\nIn recent years, the perception of the Indo-Pacific as a maritime construct has been reinforced by the growing competition between powers including the US, China, India, and Japan, vying for influence. Since regional navies too have done their best to reinforce this perception, it was only appropriate that an army conclave should see an attempt at correcting this “maritime bias”. Unusually for the Indian political milieu, it fell to defence minister Rajnath Singh to undertake this endeavour.\\n“The Indo-Pacific region,” remarked the minister, in his inaugural address, “has emerged as a pivotal construct, in recent years, transforming from a primarily maritime concept into a comprehensive strategic framework”. Highlighting the “web of complex security challenges” that faced the Indo-Pacific, the minister invoked the full involvement of regional States “with all their organisations including their armies”.\\nThe Indian Army chief, General Manoj Pande, too, drew attention to challenges other than those related to the maritime domain arising from security and humanitarian crises occurring on land. Without mentioning specific locations, he made a pointed reference to “territorial disputes over land masses”, and to “artificially created islands which housed military bases”. The co-host US Army General Randy George, while emphasising the “decisive role of land power”, highlighted the importance of cooperation amongst land forces as a critical component of the “collective response” that IPACC was expected to provide. Although mention of China was studiously avoided, the unseen presence of the expansionist/revisionist “dragon” would have loomed large over the conference, and with good reason.\\nWay back in 1904, English geographer Halford Mackinder had put forth the proposition that the 400-year era of sea power was over and the future of global power lay not in grand fleets dominating the global sea lanes, but in control of the vast land mass of “Eurasia”, which he called the “World Island”. Eurasia was then dominated by Imperial Russia, to be replaced by the erstwhile Soviet Union. Today, it is China that is integrating Asia with Europe through its terrestrial network of high-speed railways, energy pipelines and fibre optic cables.\\nBeijing’s grand strategy, which seeks a dominant economic, political, and military presence spanning the Indo-Pacific, is encapsulated in Xi Jinping’s prized Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in which the “Belt” refers to Chinese ambitions on land, and the “Road” to its seaward component, the “Maritime Silk Road”. Implementation of BRI has led to a colossal investment in infrastructure and developmental projects across the Indo-Pacific, with implications for terrestrial connectivity, trade, and security.\\nThus, while maritime security remains a major concern, the terrestrial implications of the Indo-Pacific construct are becoming increasingly important as the region faces new challenges, such as territorial disputes, non-traditional security threats and the climate crisis. The current advocacy of land power by Indo-Pacific armies is an echo of 20th century British strategist Julian Corbett’s caution that, “…it is almost impossible that a war can be decided by naval action alone… great issues between nations have always been decided by what your army can do against your enemy’s territory... or else by what the fleet enables your army to do.” That having been said, in the context of India’s security, there is a need to remain sharply focused on its unique geophysical location, with its attendant challenges and rewards.\\nIn the Himalayas, where the Indian Army has been locked in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation with the People’s Liberation Army since 2020, the equation is tilted in China’s favour, given the latter’s superior infrastructure, lines of communications and indigenous military-industrial base. Should it come to a showdown, the best that India’s land and air forces can hope to achieve is a precarious stalemate.\\nAt sea, on the other hand, India’s favourable maritime geography and China’s heavy dependence for energy and trade on the Indian Ocean sea lanes, constitute a huge vulnerability for the latter. It is against this background that maritime strategist Rear Admiral Raja Menon, in a recent article, recommends, somewhat bellicosely, holding out the threat of, “…turning the Malacca Straits into a killing ground for the Chinese”.\\nThus, while endeavours to enhance cooperation and interoperability amongst the Indo-Pacific armies are to be welcomed, it must be acknowledged that “boots on the ground” will be deployed only for humanitarian and benign purposes, never for intra-regional conflicts. As for the Indian Army, it must recognise the versatility of maritime forces, and view accretions to our naval strength – whether nuclear attack submarines or aircraft carriers – not through a zero-sum prism, but as force-multipliers for its own endeavours on land.\\nArun Prakash is a former Indian Navy chief.

That’s one aspect of it. There are tensions which obviously have a long history that precede that.

He pointed out that among the themes of the G20 summit was the Green Development Pact, but this at a time when sustainability was under threat due to the “tremendous toll” that Covid-19 had taken on developing countries to pursue SDG (sustainable development goals) pathways.\\nOn green development, he said that with each passing year, tech options were growing. “Lots of things are viable today. In the past, we often had a problem where we didn’t have a solution. Today, we have a solution. The issue is to scale it up, make it affordable. And if it is affordable, then it is accessible.” The reform of international financial institutions, green development pact, sustainable development goals won’t get fixed without a solution on other, he added.\\nReferring to these as the larger themes of Indian G20 presidency, he said, “There is a possibility that there could be some progress on some of these issues.”\\nHe added when discussing the diversity of supply chains, given how often big climate events were occurring, the globally disruptive effects of those events, and the over-centralisation of production (in China), during risk assessments, it was also key to bring climate in. He added that with regard to international financial institutions, it was important to leverage resources one had besides issues of recapitalisation.\\nJaishankar was asked a question about the 25th anniversary of the Pokharan tests, linked with India’s independent choices on technology and whether India could chart its own pathway especially on tech and geopolitical power.\\nThe minister said that the question fit into the multipolar picture that they discussed, and if he was to reflect on the last decade, particularly the last few years, there was “no lack of advice” but India had to think through solutions for itself. He said that it was important to take experiences and lessons from others, but a country of the scale and complexity of India had to assess its situation, dig into experiences and DNA, and come up with the right answers.\\nThen, offering examples of different and independent pathways, he said, he spoke of how when Covid hit India, it didn’t have much health infrastructure to deal with it. But, the minister said, India pushed for manufacturing and inventing vaccines, it used a digital backbone for a mass scale vaccination campaign, and with it, India found a unique way with much higher percentage and speed of vaccination across complex geographies than others.\\nAlso Read: Told Canada not GOI policy, says S Jaishankar on Trudeau’s allegation\\nOn the economy, Jaishankar pointed out that there was worry about what to do with the economy. “Some countries went in for pump priming, there were countries who actually thought supporting businesses was one way of mitigating the situation. Probably in their situation, it made sense. We had to look at basics. How do you deal with a large segment of population where a lockdown meant a loss of livelihood, and they didn’t have access to food and finances.”\\nHe then said that if he looked back, India was able to create a social welfare system, effectively giving the equivalent of food stamps to 800 million people, put money directly in the accounts of 450 million people, housing to 150 million. “A lot of it is through the embrace of tech answers,” he said, adding that India was even deploying its own 5G stack when the world thought it only had China and Europe to choose from.\\n“Whether it is development or security or policy choices maybe on climate action or food security or energy, it is important for a country like India to think through for itself.”\\nOther experiences mattered, Jaishankar said, adding that India was active and open to best practices around and one learnt something from someone every day. “But we have to think through for ourselves. That is one of the differences in India today.”\\nThe minister then clarified that this idea of a self reliant India did not mean economic protectionism, for India was actively seeking foreign investment, technology, and introduced incentive schemes to collaborate in sectors such as semiconductors. “What we want is for them to collaborate with us, but on our terms and on our strategic kind of pathway rather than make us a part of their strategy,”.

Each state left its unique cultural stamp on the minds of the delegates, thereby giving the world an idea of India’s diversity,” he said.\\nMishra said a key priority of India’s G20 Presidency was to create a more inclusive world, where the voice of the Global South would no longer be overlooked. “The greatest achievement in this regard was the acceptance of India’s proposal to welcome the African Union as a permanent member of the G20,” he said.\\nGet Latest India News along with Latest News and Top Headlines from India and around the world\\nTOPICS\\nG20 Summit\"}, '23': {'id': 23, 'publisher': 'Hinduatan Times', 'title': 'Delhi dengue cases cross 3,000 for year, worst since 2015', 'link': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-dengue-cases-cross-3-000-for-year-worst-since-2015-101695753493775.html', 'publish_details': 'Sep 27, 2023 09:00 AM IST', 'content': \"Delhi dengue cases cross 3,000 for year, worst since 2015\\nBy\\nParas Singh\\nSep 27, 2023 09:00 AM IST\\nIn 2015, Delhi logged 15,867 cases and 60 deaths in an unusual spike driven by a particularly virulent strain of the disease\\nThe national capital may be going through its worst dengue outbreak since 2015, with over 3,000 infections and one death so far this year.

That year, Delhi logged 15,867 cases and 60 deaths in an unusual spike driven by a particularly virulent strain of the disease that spread through the city.\\nWe're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.\\nYet, according to MCD house leader and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Mukesh Goyal, there were “strict instructions from the top” that the Capital’s dengue numbers for the year not be released due to the G20 Summit, which was held on September 9 and 10.\\n“Our senior officers have told us that there were strict instructions from the top that reports should not be released due to the G20 Summit as several heads of state and representatives would be visiting Delhi. Delhi’s image should not reflect a situation where a foreign delegation decides to not visit the city due to rising dengue cases,” Goyal said during a short-notice discussion on the floor of the House.\\nHis comments triggered an immediate backlash from the Bharatiya Janata Party, which accused the AAP of trying the disguise the spread of the outbreak “to hide the real situation”.\\nRaja Iqbal Singh, former North MCD mayor and the BJP’s councillor from Mukherjee Nagar, said the data was “hidden from the public eye” because matters on the ground were “spiralling out of control”.\\n“Efforts to control dengue on the ground are lacking. The numbers released by the corporation are not accurate... There are not enough medicines and anti-mosquito larvicides for fogging drive,” Singh told the House, demanding an inquiry.\\nYogesh Verma , former leader of house and representative of Keshavpuram, said that multiple deaths have been reported in areas of several councillors, and the official figure of just one death does not reflect the reality. “If the officers are citing that the reports were stopped due to G20 then they should be named and action should be taken against them. They were betraying the people of Delhi,” he said.\\nThe Delhi government did not respond to queries for comment sent by HT.\\nMayor Shelly Oberoi, later in a post on X, wrote in Hindi, “There is enough medicine for fogging and destroying larvae in Delhi, BJP is trying to mislead people.”\\nMCD has not released its usual dengue bulletin, released every week during the monsoon, since August 7, and officials have so far defended this saying that it “is not a statutory mandate to release a report every week”, and that “things are under control”. In the last update on August 7, for the weekly cycle ending on August 5, Delhi had registered 105 new cases, taking the overall count of dengue cases reported during this year to 348.\\nBJP state president Virendra Sachdeva, in a press conference, said that at present, the number of dengue patients is continuously increasing in both government and private hospitals. He said in the past, MCD would share the complete dengue data, “but to hide its incompetence, now Arvind Kejriwal is not allowing MCD to share these figures”.\\nIn comparison to the 3,013 dengue cases so far in 2023, during the same point last year, Delhi recorded 937 dengue cases. This number was just 341 in 2021; 212 in 2020; 282 in 2019; 481 in 2018; 1,807 in 2017; and 1,692 in 2016. It was only higher in 2015, when Delhi clocked 5,982 dengue cases between January 1 and September 26.\\nNine people died of the disease last year, a dip from 23 in 2021, but higher than the counts in 2020 (1), 2019 (2) and 2018 (4). The city saw 10 deaths of the infection each in 2017 and 2016.\\nTo be sure, dengue cases usually spike in September and October, which means the numbers will likely swell for a few more weeks, till temperatures begin to drop.\\nTemperatures of around 20°Cmake the environment inhospitable for the aedes aegypti mosquito, which causes dengue.\\nAccording to the state health ministry, a more dangerous strain of dengue is in circulation this year.\\nOn July 28, health minister Saurabh Bhardwaj said that genome sequencing of 20 dengue-positive samples in Delhi showed that 19 of these had severe strain type 2. While the type 1 strain can cause fever, type 2 — a more severe variant — can lead to fatal haemorrhagic fever with shock and chills.\\nDr BK Tripathi, professor in the department of medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said that the rapid rise in cases was also being reflected in hospitals where many dengue patients also complained of bleeding.\\n“Cases of repeat infection are more complicated irrespective of the strain. The type 2 strain is more prevalent but very complicated cases have not started appearing in bulk as yet,” he said.\\nMeanwhile, municipal health officer LR Verma countered assured that adequate stocks of larvicides and fogging drugs have been procured to last the dengue season this year.\\nTOPICS\\nG20 Summit\"}, '24': {'id': 24, 'publisher': 'Hinduatan Times', 'title': 'Just as India ‘gave voice to a continent’, EAM pushes for more inclusion in UN', 'link': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eam-jaishankar-pushes-for-more-inclusion-in-un-just-as-india-gave-voice-to-a-continent-101695739168419.html', 'publish_details': 'Sep 26, 2023 08:22 PM IST', 'content': 'EAM Jaishankar pushes for more inclusion in UN, just as India ‘gave voice to a continent’\\nPTI |\\nSep 26, 2023 08:22 PM IST\\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that the African Union\\'s inclusion in the G20 was a \"significant step.\"\\nCiting the example of India’s initiative at the recently concluded G20 Summit to admit the African Union as a permanent member, India on Tuesday exhorted the United Nations to get inspired “to also make the Security Council contemporary.”\\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar(PTI)\\nAt the G20 Summit in New Delhi earlier this month, the grouping of emerging and developed economies adopted the New Delhi Leaders\\' Declaration through consensus and included the African Union as a permanent member of the bloc.\\nWe\\'re now on WhatsApp. Click to join.\\nFollow LIVE updates on UNGA Meet here\\nAddressing the 78th UN General Assembly session here, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that the African Union\\'s inclusion in the G20 was a \"significant step.\"\\n“It was (also) noteworthy that at India’s initiative, the African Union was admitted as a permanent member of the G20.

(ANI)\\nThis year’s exposition, scheduled for November 14-27, is set to be the biggest ever trade fair Delhi has ever hosted, the officials said, adding that drawing from the G20 Summit, its theme will be “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - United by Trade”.\\nWe're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.\\nPradeep Singh Kharola, ITPO chairman and managing director, said, “This will be the largest trade fair Delhi has ever hosted. We plan to use all 14 exhibition halls along with the open area and the convention centre area as well. The trade fair will be held in its full glory.”\\nKrishan Kumar, the deputy general manager overseeing the trade fair, said this is the first time that all 14 halls of the complex will be occupied. “This year’s fair will be held over an area of more than 120,000sqm, while last year’s event was held across 73,000 sqm.”\\nKumar said during the fair, food streets will be set up in open areas. “We will have more than 30 state cuisines... The number of government departments will go up from 53 to 70. We are already getting requests from countries like Qatar for international delegations,” he said.\\nAnother official overseeing the preparations for the trade fair said registrations for the event started on September 15. “With the availability of more space, we will have dedicated food zones. Each state will be provided with separate space over the 20,000 sqm open space. We will also be setting up SAARC countries’ food zone in this open area,” the official said, declining to be named.\\nITPO also expects to surpass the previous footfall record of 1.8 million people, set in 2015, the official said.\\nThe area where Pragati Maidan stands today once served as the Capital’s exhibition ground, and hosted many international events, including the World Agriculture Fair in 1959, which was inaugurated by the then US President Dwight D Eisenhower.\\nLater, the government decided to build an events venue at the spot, and architect Raj Rewal designed the original layout of the complex, which was inaugurated in November 1972 by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The iconic Hall of Nations was the venue of Asia 1972 — the third Asian International Trade Fair — coinciding with the India’s silver jubilee year of Independence.\\nIn 1980, Pragati Maidan hosted its first India International Trade Fair, and with the gradual addition of more halls and state pavilions, the event has grown into a major tourist attraction.\\nChetan Sharma, 68, a resident of Greater Kailash 2, said visiting Pragati Maidan for the trade fair used to be an annual family affair for him in 1980s and 90s. “This used to be the biggest event of the year. Winter was not yet too harsh, and families would spend the entire day strolling in the pavilions… Everyone in the family had something to look forward to,” he said, adding that this was the first event in Delhi where the general public could purchase products from other countries.\\nPankaj Aggarwal, 62, a resident of Safdarjung Enclave, added, “We had relatives coming to Delhi from as far as West Bengal during the winters just to visit the trade fair. There was certainly a craze about this annual event. Even in those times, Pragati Maidan would be flooded with people, even though the population of the city was much smaller.”\\nThe ITPO official quoted above said the organisation hosts over a dozen fairs over the year, but the trade fair —now a winter fixture —is their bread and butter. “We say that just one successful trade fair makes us enough money to pay the salaries of all ITPO employees through the year,” the official said.\\nA proposal to redevelop Pragati Maidan with a new convention centre was floated ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. ITPO conceptualised the comprehensive International Exhibition and Convention Centre (IECC) project in December 2015, and the Union cabinet approved it in 2017.\\nUnder the proposal, the Hall of Nations and four other halls were to be demolished, sparking outrage among heritage conservationists and city residents.\\nAt the time of demolition, a joint statement by Rewal, structural engineer Mahendra Raj, former INTACH convener (Delhi chapter) AGK Menon, and Indian Institute of Architects presidents Divya Kush had said, “We consider the demolition of the Hall of Nations at Pragati Maidan an act of outrage...”\\nEventually, however, the revamped Pragati Maidan complex project was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July this year, and the G20 Summit was held at the Bharat Mandapam centre on September 9 and 10.\\nThe ITPO official quoted above said this year, the organisation will also expand the trade fair to other parts of the country, starting with Jammu and Kashmir.\\n“Before the Delhi fair is held in November, a J&K trade fair will be organised between September 27 to October 2. We are trying to hold similar fairs in other parts of the country,” the official said.\\nThe event will be held at Srinagar’s emporium garden grounds, and will feature sections on horticulture products, crafts, handloom, carpets, spices among other local products.\\n“The idea is to export the trade fairs in areas with untapped economic potential.

The announcement capped nine months of frenzied activity which involved thousands of meetings, consultations, and side events associated with India’s presidency. This week on Grand Tamasha, a weekly podcast coproduced by HT and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, host Milan Vaishnav sat down with commentator Ashok Malik to discuss the larger implications of India’s triumph. Malik, now in the private sector, previously served as policy advisor to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and speech writer and spokesperson for former President Ram Nath Kovind.\\nGrand Tamasha this week highlights implications of India’s triumph at G20 meet. (HT Photo)\\nMalik stressed the significance of India ensuring that consensus among the fractious group was achieved, not just for India but for the organization as a whole. “It was important for the G20 to establish that it was still resilient, still viable, and still had utility and value in this post-Ukraine, post-COVID, and post-geopolitical rift world,” remarked Malik. “And particularly, that it could still be of use to the vast concourse of humanity—the 125 odd countries of the Global South.” Malik suggested that India’s success at the G20 will have lasting impacts on India’s global image: “The world became more acutely aware of India’s ability to be a problem-solver, a bridge, a negotiator, and a force for international reconciliation…in the best manner possible.”\\nWe're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.\\nMalik also stressed that India’s foreign policy engagement also has greater domestic salience than ever before, an important development in an election year. According to him, this is a function of the massive changes India’s economy has experienced since the 1991 liberalization. “The common Indian’s interest in foreign policy has grown with international engagement. It is not a negative response to international engagement, it’s actually a positive response,” Malik explained. “In 1991, some 15 percent of India’s GDP was dependent on external trade, that number is around 45 percent today. Of course, the economy is much, much larger: it was around $300 billion in 1991 and today it’s around $3.5 trillion. A much wider proportion of a much larger economy today is dependent on international trade.”\\nOne of the highlights of the summit took place not in the summit hall, but on the sidelines, when the United States, India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and others announced a new India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC). Many observers believe this corridor serves as an explicit counter to China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). However, Malik argues that there’s an important difference between IMEEC and BRI, namely the former’s on economic viability. “These will be projects that have an economic rationale because all of the regions and countries concerned are going through enormous economic transformation and expansion,” stated Malik. He used the example of how “UAE and Saudi Arabia are investing enormously in a post-oil economy, which could mean anything from renewable energy to financial hubs and new cities…to healthcare and other emerging technologies.” There is also the normal passage of manufactured goods on this route from India to Europe and the reverse flow. “The countries involved in the [corridor] have proven economic capacities and markets. These are projects that, in the end, can be viable,” noted Malik.\\nGet Latest India News along with Latest News and Top Headlines from India and around the world\\nTOPICS\\nNew Delhi\\nG20 Summit\"}, '28': {'id': 28, 'publisher': 'Hinduatan Times', 'title': 'India-Middle East-Europe Corridor to become cornerstone of global trade: PM Modi', 'link': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiamiddle-east-europe-corridor-to-become-cornerstone-of-global-trade-pm-modi-101695541130145.html', 'publish_details': 'Sep 24, 2023 01:08 PM IST', 'content': \"India-Middle East-Europe Corridor to become cornerstone of global trade: PM Modi\\nBySaptarshi Das\\nSep 24, 2023 01:08 PM IST\\nPrime Minister Modi said that when India was very prosperous, silk routes were widely discussed in the country and the world, and history will remember that India initiated the new India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor\\nThe India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor that was proposed during the G20 Summit would go on to become a cornerstone of global trade for times to come, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said while addressing the 105th episode of Mann Ki Baat on Sunday.\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi.

He also urged people to buy some Khadi products on October 2.\\n“During the G20 summit, who can forget the sight when world leaders reached Rajghat together to pay homage to Bapu. This beautifully proves how relevant Bapu’s thoughts are even today across the world. I am also happy that many programs related to cleanliness have been planned across the country on Gandhi Jayanti. ‘Swachhata hi Seva’ campaign is underway with great enthusiasm. The Indian Swachata League is also reaching great participation. A big event on cleanliness will be organised on Sunday, October 1 at 10am. You too should take out time and join hands in this cleanliness campaign in your neighbourhood. The act of cleanliness will also be a true tribute to Gandhi ji. Also buy at least some Khadi products on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti,” the PM said.\\nIn the previous episode, the 104th, Modi delved into the historic Chandrayaan-3 mission focusing on the successful ‘soft landing’ the Vikram lander made on the Moon’s South Pole. He also extended greetings for ‘World Sanskrit Day’, celebrated on August 31, emphasising the language’s significance and its status as one of the world’s oldest languages and referred to it as the “mother of many modern languages”.

(HT Photo)\\nBut unlike the thousands of posters and potted plants that dotted the national Capital only for the summit, Delhi’s fleet of e-buses represents a lasting investment made by the Arvind Kejriwal government to battle the chronic air pollution that affects not just the national Capital but much of northern India.\\nLast week itself, Delhi added 400 new e-buses to its fleet, making it a total of 800 so far. In doing so, Delhi reached a major milestone in its journey of becoming India’s Electric Vehicle (EV) capital. Delhi now has more e-buses than any other Indian city.\\nThe next two years will see a massive 10x expansion in Delhi’s e-bus fleet from 800 to 8,000, a feat that has few parallels globally. From a total of 7,135 buses at present (11% electric), Delhi’s public bus fleet is targeted to reach 10,480 buses by 2025, 8,280 of which will be electric (almost 80%). This will catapult Delhi to become the city with the largest e-bus fleet in the world outside China.\\nDelhi’s ambitious e-bus transition plan will make a significant dent in air pollution as well as CO2 emissions. A fleet of 8,280 e-buses will eliminate 4.7 lakh tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, and 56 lakh tonnes of CO2 emissions in their lifetime of 12 years.\\nThe scale and pace of Delhi’s e-bus transition plan weren’t trivial and came with its fair share of challenges. The first was financial. Electric buses are twice as expensive as CNG buses in terms of their upfront cost, largely due to expensive batteries, but they are cheaper to run. A fleet of 8,280 e-buses meant an investment of over ₹3,000 crore annually by the Delhi government or ₹36,000 crore over 12 years. It was crucial that the Delhi government did this without diluting its commitment to provide free public transport to 40% of its passengers — women.\\nThe next challenge was upgrading Delhi’s bus depots and electricity grid infrastructure. Delhi’s 8,280 e-buses are estimated to increase Delhi’s energy demand by 450MW by 2025. This needs careful planning to ensure no power outages or grid failures. A wide network of 57 existing bus depots spanning every corner of Delhi had to be electrified, 13 new bus depots built from scratch and the electricity grid upgraded at a cost of ₹1,500 crore.\\nYet another challenge was human. Thousands of staff in Delhi’s public transport authorities, used to running CNG buses for the last two decades, had to be retrained and reoriented to run a fully e-bus fleet. These are also the most advanced bus fleets anywhere in India with fully AC low-floor buses, automated drives, CCTV cameras, panic buttons, disabled-friendly features and live tracking through a central command centre. These challenges were surmounted thanks to a resolute leadership that has made fighting air pollution by investing in clean and green public transport among its foremost political priorities.\\nDelhi’s emergence as India’s EV capital is a result of years of careful planning and execution. The journey began with the announcement of the landmark Delhi EV Policy in August 2020 by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. The policy is widely acknowledged as the most progressive EV policy by any state or Union Territory (UT) in India. Delhi became the first state or UT to set out an explicit mandate of ensuring 25% of all new vehicle registrations are EVs by 2024.\\nThis was followed by another bold public commitment in 2021 when the Delhi government announced that all its future public bus procurements would be e-buses. Despite the gravity of the air pollution crisis facing dozens of Indian cities, Delhi was, in 2021, and still is, the only Indian city to make such an explicit commitment. It is also the only Indian city to join a select league of global cities such as London, Paris and Los Angeles driving the climate crisis agenda by making a public commitment of fully transitioning to zero-emission public transport. Delhi’s progress in achieving a zero-emissions public transport goal through a mix of firm political leadership, public commitments to goals and years of sound financial and infrastructure planning offers a template for all Indian cities battling air pollution. And there are many. India has 22 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world as per the 2022 rankings of IQ Air.\\nUnfortunately, many Indian states and cities continue to underinvest in public transport and air pollution reduction efforts. The Centre too can step up and offer substantial financial support to cities making a time-bound transition plan to zero-emissions public transport. Yet, so far, the Centre has offered minuscule financial support to cities investing in clean public transport. The Centre’s FAME scheme to promote EVs provides a small subsidy to 7,000 e-buses nationally over five years (2019-24), only half of which have been deployed as of date. In Delhi’s case, the Centre’s subsidy will be limited to only 1,320 of the targeted 8,200 e-buses, and that too for 10% of their lifetime costs. Delhi’s example offers hope that individual states and cities can step up by marshalling their own resources to provide their citizens with the most precious of rights – the right to breathe clean air.\\nJasmine Shah is vice-chairperson, Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi.

One emphasises investments in physical infrastructure through the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC). The other emphasises investments in digital public infrastructure (DPI). While IMEC has grabbed more eyeballs, it still seems a sketchy plan compared to the DPI model. The DPI model advanced by India has already found takers in some parts of the Global South.\\nThe adoption of the DPI model could open up new vistas of opportunities for India’s IT sector while raising the country’s profile globally.(Getty Images)\\nFive years ago, the International Institute of Information Technology in Bengaluru launched the Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP) to help other countries set up Aadhaar-like systems. More than 10 countries, from Sri Lanka to Sierra Leone, have initiated MOSIP projects so far. After the G20’s endorsement, many more could sign up for it.\\nWe're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.\\nThe adoption of the DPI model could open up new vistas of opportunities for India’s IT sector while raising the country’s profile globally. However, the DPI momentum can be sustained only if policymakers take into account both the strengths and weaknesses of India’s own digital infrastructure. They must not lose sight of the chinks in the institutional architecture underpinning India’s DPI model. Fixing these gaps will help Indian citizens, and offer a more robust model for the rest of the world.\\nThere are three key elements of India’s DPI offering that have evinced global interest. First, a digital ID system for citizens that enables authentication of welfare beneficiaries, and helps tackle leakages. Second, an open source software architecture that is designed to avoid dependence on any one technology giant. Third, a fast payment system that can leverage the digital ID system to widen the net of financial inclusion, and catalyse growth.\\nGrowing fiscal concerns have led many governments to consider more efficient ways of distributing welfare benefits. Digitisation is increasingly being seen as a means to save fiscal resources while targeting state spending better. At the same time, digitisation has also raised concerns about the dominance of American big tech and Chinese surveillance tech. India’s offering of an open digital ecosystem taps into these anxieties.\\nWhile the MOSIP project is likely to lead to new business for Indian software firms, no single firm will be in a position to dictate terms to any foreign government. The project itself is being led by an academic institution, and not by a software firm. India’s fast payments system is run by a not-for-profit corporation backed by the central bank. These facets of India’s DPI model have burnished its appeal.\\nNonetheless, the Indian DPI model is not without its share of challenges. The first challenge is the lack of a robust legal framework to protect citizens’ data. As a parliamentary standing committee had pointed out in 2010, the Aadhaar project should have been started only after a national data protection law was enacted. Yet, the project ran for more than a decade without any such legal cover.\\nThe 2023 data protection law offers much weaker data protection than was envisaged by expert committees set up earlier by the government. As the lawyer Apar Gupta argued in these pages, successive versions of India’s draft data protection law have tended to dilute protection for citizens while expanding the powers of the Indian State. A 2019 document from MOSIP emphasised the need to prioritise “privacy and user control” in partner countries. But India must first practise at home what it preaches abroad.\\nThe second challenge relates to the coercion and exclusion involved in India’s DPI model. Aadhaar was supposed to be an enabler. Once people start realising its benefits, the Aadhaar user base would grow organically, we were told during the early years of Aadhaar. The actual script has been very different.\\nAadhaar morphed into a de facto requirement for accessing any benefit or service from the Indian State, or even from financial institutions. This has hurt some of India’s most deprived regions, where data connectivity remains poor and Aadhaar authentication failures are common.\\nThe third challenge relates to the risk of overselling the impact of India’s DPI model. While there is no doubt that India’s progress on digital and financial inclusion has been impressive, there are several other countries with an even more impressive record. An analysis of World Bank data by Suyash Rai of Carnegie India shows that India’s record in financial inclusion has been middling. The growth in penetration of bank accounts has been exceptionally high in recent years. But so has been the share of inactive accounts.\\nEven in the realm of fast payments, India’s achievements are not as exceptional as government officials would have you believe. Between 2010 and 2021, roughly 50 countries have set up fast payment systems, a 2021 report from the Bank for International Settlements showed. Digital transactions in some of these countries have grown faster than in India. None of these countries needed to demonetise currency notes to boost digital payments.\\nOn balance, India’s DPI model remains an attractive proposition for developing countries. But if India’s “digital belt and road initiative” (as The Economist termed it) is to have a better future than China’s Belt and Road project, Indian policymakers must resist the temptation of premature celebration. Instead of dismissing critics, they need to engage with them, and address the chinks in the DPI model. In doing so, they would be serving the interests of their country and the world at the same time.\\nPramit Bhattacharya is a Chennai-based journalist.
