0,mint,India's economy likely moderated to 7% in Q2; experts expect further moderation,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-q2-gdp-preview-indias-economy-likely-moderated-to-about-7-in-q2-experts-expect-further-moderation-ahead-11700645006556.html,22 Nov 2023,,"The Indian economy continues to rank among the world's fastest-growing large economies. Forecasts indicate sustained momentum in the upcoming financial year. Nevertheless, factors such as the global economic slowdown, insufficient rainfall, and a decrease in government capital expenditure might lead to a moderation in the country's growth trajectory.

Experts believe India's Q2FY24 GDP expanded in the range of 6.8-7.1 per cent, lower than the 7.8 per cent in Q1FY24.

India's Q2FY24 GDP print is expected on Thursday, November 30.

Analysts at Barclays believe India‚Äôs GDP in Q2FY24 expanded by 6.8 per cent year-on-year, slower than the 7.8 per cent print in Q1FY24, but still showing robust sequential growth.

""Underlying growth trends continue to look robust in India, with activity underpinned by domestic consumption, high levels of state-led capex, and strong growth in the utilities sectors,"" Barclays said in a report.

Services will continue to be the largest contributor to growth in Q2, despite slower expected growth in the financial services and 'trade hotels and transport' categories, Barclays believes.

""Growth in services is likely to moderate from double-digit seen in Q1FY24, but still strong nevertheless (nearly 7.7 per cent), according to our estimates,"" said Barclays.

For FY23-24, Barclays forecasts GDP growth of 6.3 per cent, but sees upside risks, emanating largely from very strong consumption demand, which is visible across a variety of high-frequency data.

""Credit growth, electricity consumption, and mobility indicators all paint a picture of economic resilience, hence we believe that the domestic economy will continue to drive growth,"" said Barclays.

SBI Research forecasts that the GDP growth for the Q2FY24 should be at 6.9-7.1 per cent.

""We forecast that the quarterly GDP growth for the Q2FY24 should be at 6.9-7.1 per cent, though there could be still a forecasting bias. The mean growth rate thus comes at around 7 per cent for Q2FY24. This will firmly push up the FY24 growth rate over RBI projections at 6.5 per cent,"" said SBI Research in its Ecowrap note.

SBI Research observed in its report that the domestic economic activity in Q2 has been supported by robust agricultural performance, sustained buoyancy in services, strong capital expenditure by the Centre (49 per cent of budgeted) and states (32 per cent of budgeted) and a robust pick up in consumption expenditure.

ICRA has projected the year-on-year growth of the GDP to moderate sequentially to 7 per cent in Q2FY24.

""The GVA growth is estimated to ease to 6.8 per cent in Q2 from 7.8 per cent in Q1, driven by the services sector (to +8.2 per cent from +10.3 per cent) and agriculture (to +1 per cent from +3.5 per cent), amidst an improvement in the industry (to +6.6 per cent from +5.5 per cent),"" said ICRA.

Further moderation ahead

Experts remain positive about India's growth outlook but they believe the economy will see further moderation in the coming quarters.

Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers expects the GDP to grow at 6.9 per cent in Q2 but it will moderate going ahead.

""Going ahead, we will see a drag coming from a slowdown in the US. Further, we think lower reservoir levels and volatile food inflation need to be watched out for. Finally, the uncertainty around the election will also pressure private investments in the upcoming quarters,"" said Hajra.

Kapil Gupta, Executive Director at Nuvama Institutional Equities believes Q2 GDP could be closer to 7 per cent, which will be better than RBI‚Äôs estimates.

Gupta pointed out that better-than-expected earnings of the corporates during the quarter would aid the GDP growth, although growth rates will decelerate in the second half of the current financial year (H2FY24).

Gupta believes in the next year, India‚Äôs outlook will be shaped by global factors and if the US economy goes into a recession, it will have a bearing on India‚Äôs growth momentum. On the domestic side, government capex, too, could moderate and tax revenue growth could normalise from elevated levels.

Further, the lagged impact of RBI‚Äôs tightening and the latest RBI announcement regarding the increase of risk weights for consumer loans could weigh on lending growth.

""Unless private capex accelerates and broadens, overall growth momentum could moderate. That said, India‚Äôs macro vulnerability remains low. Current account deficit is largely contained and the balance sheet of the domestic banking system is in a very good shape, which should work to limit the downside,"" Gupta said.

In its economic review for October, the ministry said a fuller transmission of the monetary policy may also temper domestic demand, although the review noted India‚Äôs growth in FY24 should continue to be a positive outlier compared to other major economies.

At its latest rate-setting bi-monthly meeting in October, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the repo rate unchanged for the fourth consecutive time at 6.5%.

A higher repo rate makes debt and debt-servicing more expensive, thus slowing down economic activity.

The rupee has depreciated 1.81% against the dollar in the last 12 months, making foreign currency borrowings and imports more expensive.

The latest economic review said policy measures by the government and the transmission of monetary policy tightening has helped rein in inflation.

‚ÄúInflationary pressures have also moderated. Consumer price index (CPI) declined in October 2023, mainly due to the dip in core (non-food, non-fuel) inflation,"" the review said.

‚ÄúThe trend in Wholesale Price Index (WPI) also suggests that the cost of principal inputs to production in the economy has declined overall.""

Retail inflation fell to a four-month low of 4.87% in October as food prices and core inflation eased, thus remaining within the RBI‚Äôs comfort zone of 2-6% for the second consecutive month.

Meanwhile, wholesale inflation stayed in the deflationary zone at -0.52% in October as prices eased across food, electricity and textiles.

‚ÄúOn balance, however, India‚Äôs growth experience in FY24 will continue to be a positive outlier as compared to other major economies,"" the review said.

‚ÄúIn the medium term, thanks to the sustained focus on public investment in infrastructure and advances in digital public infrastructure, India can look ahead to the prospect of a longer economic and financial cycle than in the past, subject to global factors,"" it added.

‚ÄúThe central government is on track to achieve the budgeted deficit target for the current fiscal year as well,"" the review said.

‚ÄúThe government‚Äôs emphasis on capital expenditure has continued during the year as well, imparting an impetus to private investment. The recent steep and rapid decline in global crude oil prices removes an important source of potential impact on public finances as well,"" it added.

The government expects to maintain the fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of gross domestic product.

In September, Fitch Ratings retained its growth forecast for the current fiscal at 6.3%, saying the Indian economy continues to show resilience despite tighter monetary policy and export weaknesses. It also expects India to maintain 6.5% GDP growth until FY25.

S&P Global has predicted 6% GDP growth for FY24, citing a slowing world economy, rising risk of subnormal monsoons and the delayed effect of a rate hike. At the same time, it estimated 6-7.1% GDP growth during 2024-2026, calling India‚Äôs growth prospects ‚Äústrong"".

In comparison, major global economies are expected to grow at a much slower pace. The United States, the world‚Äôs largest economy, is expected to grow at 2.1% annually during calendar year 2024, according to Goldman Sachs.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects China, the world‚Äôs second largest economy, to grow at 4.6% during calendar year 2024.

Meanwhile, buoyant tax collections this year have created more fiscal space for spending. Tax collections are stronger than expected, with total government revenues expected to substantially exceed budgeted estimates amid increased economic activity.

ICRA said in its report that India's economic growth is anticipated to have eased to 7% in the second quarter, following a 7.8% growth in the first quarter. This adjustment is attributed to a normalizing base and unpredictable monsoon patterns.

‚ÄúLooking ahead, uneven rainfall, narrowing differentials with year-ago commodity prices, the possible slowdown in momentum of government capex as we approach the Parliamentary Elections, weak external demand and the cumulative impact of monetary tightening are likely to translate into lower GDP growth in H2FY24,"" said Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head-Research & Outreach, ICRA.

She further added, ‚ÄúAs a result, we maintain our FY2024 GDP growth estimate at 6.0%, lower than the MPC‚Äôs projection of 6.5% for the fiscal.""

During the second quarter, investment activity in the country sustained its strength, with seven out of eleven investment-related indicators showing improved year-on-year growth compared to the first quarter, the report highlighted.

""While the YoY growth in the remaining four indicators weakened in Q2 FY2024 relative to Q1, all of them witnessed a double-digit expansion in the quarter, including the CV registrations (+13.5 per cent), cement production (+10.2 per cent), the states‚Äô capital outlay and net lending (+33.5 per cent), and the Government of India‚Äôs (GoI‚Äôs) capex (+26.4 per cent),"" ICRA said in its note.

According to data, the Center's annual gross capital expenditure rose by 26.4% to ‚Çπ2.1 lakh crore in the second quarter, a decrease from the ‚Çπ2.8 lakh crore recorded in the first quarter.

Construction activity sustained robust momentum in the second quarter, despite below-average rainfall causing comparatively fewer disruptions than historical patterns, according to ICRA.

‚ÄúWith a slowdown in national highway construction, the GVA growth of this sub-sector is likely to have eased to 7.0% in Q2FY24 from 7.9% in Q1FY24,"" the note said.

3,mint,"India lost the World Cup, but it was probably not a loss for the economy",https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/india-lost-the-world-cup-but-it-was-probably-not-a-loss-for-the-economy-11700470295865.html,20 Nov 2023,,"India lost the cricket World Cup, after powering through the tournament to reach the finals unbeaten. Then it lost, leaving millions of fans heartbroken. That said, there is no gainsaying that hosting the one-day cricket tournament, which takes place once every four years, has provided a boost to the Indian economy.

The World Cup semifinals and the finals were festivals on par with Diwali. This not just in the cities that hosted the matches, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, respectively, but for most of the country, wherever audiences gathered in front of a screen, often in large gatherings at restaurants and pubs, apart from homes, on the one hand, and, on the other, the specially rigged match-watching venues with large screens, large crowds, beer to be guzzled and snacks to be munched on for the duration of the match, if not wolfed down.

Sweets were purchased in anticipation of victory celebration. Sugar sales went up, as did the sales of milk solids, nuts, dry fruit and flavouring agents that go into sweets and ice cream. Paper cartons, glossy covers to cover the cardboard also saw a surge in demand.

All tournament venues were spruced up, and given fresh coats of paint. Stadium seats that had been broken were repaired, those on which lewd declarations of love had been engraved thoroughly scrubbed clean of misplaced passion. All that generated revenue and employment for suppliers, and contractors and workers.

Business newspapers ran stories of quick service restaurants, quick commerce companies and food delivery businesses reporting record numbers of orders on match days. Match-hosting cities saw hotel room tariffs and restaurant bookings boom. Airfares to Ahmedabad for final soared. Ticket prices on the black market soared as well. Of course, higher fares do not directly create additional flights, unless people charter flights as an alternative, but the additional revenue raked in through higher prices for a finite supply of airline seats or stadium tickets leads to additional spending on the part of the recipients.

Team India jersey sales spiked throughout the tournament period. Television sales zoomed, too. Many chose this occasion to upgrade their TV sets to thinner, brighter, higher resolution models capable of showing darker blacks and truer colours. Some also upgraded to bigger TV screens. Retailers, cargo fleets, delivery agents, and technicians who visited homes for installation, demo and, if possible, to wangle an extended warranty, found additional business.

Those who provide retail finance, whether banks or non-banking finance companies, did brisk business, notwithstanding the dampener the RBI has smothered the sector with, seeking higher risk weightage and capital provisioning. The myriad agents who process loan documents saw brisk work.

Television advertisers saw hectic action. Those who managed to get time slots for broadcast during the match made commercial films, spending enough to make them high-impact affairs. Creative spirits at advertising agencies, copywriters, actors, models, make-up artistes, film crews saw demand that would not have been generated but for the World Cup and the audience attention it was guaranteed to generate.

Official sponsors advertised in multiple media to show off their sponsorship of India‚Äôs favourite sport. Those who did not get to sponsor the official tournament always dream of repeating Pepsi‚Äôs ‚Äònothing-official-about-it‚Äô ambush marketing that left a greater impact on audiences than the official sponsor Coca Cola‚Äôs efforts. These efforts spill over across multiple media, benefitting all businesses that see advertising as a major source of revenue.

Telecom operators saw high data traffic as millions of people watched the matches live on television screens, tablets, computers, or phones. Many who did not have broadband connections over optical fibre secured them.

The demand for routers, optical fibre, ducts for laying them, and the services of technicians who install the routers rose. Technology services that allow streaming on the scale a World Cup audience calls for saw additional demand even from cloud storage companies and vendors of software that provide distributed caches to minimize latency of signal reception.

The popular enthusiasm generated by the game and the blitzkrieg of advertising that accompanied it, all referencing the tournament, would have led to greater interest in cricket, leading to greater sales of kit. Those who make bats, balls and gloves of different kinds saw a boost in demand.

If the intense advertising of products and services that accompanied the match broadcast has any impact on purchase decisions at all, India should see a sales bump in sectors such as automobiles, home appliances, cosmetics, apparel and fancy phones. All associated businesses should benefit.

All this augurs well for future editions of grand events, particularly cricket. Cricket training academies, talent scouts and coaches would do brisk business.

It is indeed sad India did not win the World Cup, after the 2011 victory, but the only clear losers here are those who hoped to ride a wave of nationalism that a World Cup win would have engendered, for their own partisan gain."

5,mint,Govt explores steps to boost affordable NBFC loans,https://www.livemint.com/companies/govt-explores-steps-to-boost-affordable-nbfc-loans-11700416942032.html,19 Nov 2023,,"NEW DELHI : The Centre is exploring options such as increasing the deposit acceptance limit for eligible non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), introducing deposit insurance and creating a specific liquidity window for NBFCs, according to two officials. The goal is to lower funding costs, enabling NBFCs to offer loans to crucial sectors such as agriculture and micro, small, and medium enterprises, at more affordable interest rates, they added.

Besides agriculture, MSMEs are a cornerstone of the Indian economy, contributing 30% to gross domestic product, 45% to manufacturing output, and 48% to exports. But agriculture and MSME sectors are facing huge credit gaps. Notably, 39% of the 63.4 million small businesses have not availed loans through any formal channel.

Consequently, the government feels there is urgent need to expand formal and affordable credit facilities via NBFCs if India has to become the third-largest economy by 2030, one of the two officials said, seeking anonymity. ‚ÄúInterest rates charged by NBFCs, however, are high, and may go up to 26%, depending on the nature of loans. Interest rates are high because the cost of funds for NBFCs are high compared with commercial banks. So, various proposals are under consideration to reduce costs,"" he said.

The FY25 Union budget might enhance MSMEs, aligning them with global markets, offering digital support for competitiveness, simplifying goods and services tax compliance, and ensuring access to low-cost credit, HT reported on 14 November.

Unlike commercial banks, many NBFCs can not accept low-cost deposit from the general public. Their funding sources are relatively expensive, as they typically lend after securing funds from banks and markets, or external commercial borrowings. It‚Äôs worth noting that most new NBFCs, categorized as NBFCs-ND, do not accept deposits. The registration of deposit-taking NBFCs (NBFCs-D) has been virtually frozen since 1998.

Cost of funds are soaring for NBFCs as central banks of major economies have raised interest rates to tame inflation.

Under these circumstances some proposals are under discussion to reduce the cost burden of NBFCs by diversifying their source of funding, particularly for priority sector lending, a second official said. ‚ÄúDeposit acceptance limit of NBFCs-D could be raised, besides deposits could be provided with an insurance cover similar to deposits in commercial bank (to minimize risks and reduce costs),"" he added.

‚ÄúWe might consider a dedicated liquidity window for the NBFCs for short-term liquidity requirements and may allow upper layer NBFCs to take public deposits under strict regulations. By reducing risk weight of loans under priority sector and by making all bank lending to NBFCs for on-lending to the priority sector could also reduce the borrowing cost for NBFCs,"" he said. Reserve Bank of India designates NBFCs-UL for heightened regulatory requirements. Typically, the top 10 eligible NBFCs, based on asset size, fall under the category. Currently, there are 15 NBFCs-UL.

‚ÄúAllowing NBFCs to take deposits would require them to strictly observe regulatory norms such as commercial banks, which will mar the nimbleness of NBFCs and may lead to loss of inherent flexibility they currently enjoy,"" an expert said, seeking anonymity. Banks are concentrated in urban and semi-urban areas, leaving large credit gaps in remaining parts of the country, which is partly met by NBFCs, he added.

Of 63.4 million MSMEs, only 25 million have access to formal credit, official data shows. Loan disbursal to MSMEs in FY21 was over ‚Çπ9.5 trillion, up from ‚Çπ6.8 trillion a year ago, mainly due to the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abiyan‚Äôs Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme, which provided 100% credit guarantee to lenders.

Both of these crucial benchmarks marked a 9.12% decline this month so far, reaching their lowest levels in four months. The substantial decrease in crude oil prices on Thursday followed a larger-than-anticipated build-up in U.S. oil inventories.

Moreover, downward pressure is also being exerted by weak economic activity indicators from the EU and China. Analysts at ICICI Securities anticipate further downside potential in the near term. Earlier this week, the International Energy Agency indicated that global oil markets won't be as tight as initially expected this quarter, as upward revisions to demand are overshadowed by upgrades to supplies.

Amid this backdrop, Indigo Paints and Kansai Nerolac Paints have jumped 5% and 2% in today's trade, while Berger Paints, Akzo Nobel India, and Asian Paints rallied between 1-2.%.

Crude oil is a key component in the production of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing of paints, such as solvents and resins. When crude oil prices drop, it can lead to lower production costs for these raw materials, positively impacting the profit margins of paint companies.

The drop in crude oil prices was also a big positive factor for a country like India, which meets 86% of its oil requirements through imports.

Following the company's Q2 performance, domestic brokerage firm Sharekhan maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock, setting a target price of ‚Çπ1,850 apiece. Motilal Oswal also retained its 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of ‚Çπ1,770 apiece.

Berger Paints India posted a 3.6% YoY improvement in its consolidated revenue to Rs. 2,767 crore, driven by a 10.9% YoY rise in volume. EBITDA experienced a significant 30.1% YoY growth to ‚Çπ474 crore, while the EBITDA margin expanded 350 basis points to 17.1%, led by lower input costs and an improved product mix.

It reported a consolidated net profit of ‚Çπ292 crore, an 33% improvement compared to a net profit of ‚Çπ220 crore in Q2FY23.

Despite the extended monsoon reducing the demand for premium emulsions and subduing the value growth, the company's economy segment products performed well, said domestic brokerage firm Geojit Financial Services.

The company‚Äôs JV, Berger Nippon Paint Automotive Coatings, sustained robust top-line growth because of an uptick in the passenger car and SUV sectors, the brokerage added.

However, the brokerage downgraded its rating on the stock to 'hold' from 'buy' with a target price of ‚Çπ643 apiece, citing heightened competition from both new and existing players. On the other hand, Kansai Nerolac and Akzo Nobel India also reported healthy numbers for Q2 FY24.

US manufacturing output falls in October

US factory production fell more than expected in October, largely led by strikes at automakers and parts suppliers.

Manufacturing output fell 0.7% last month, the most in four months, the Federal Reserve data showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory output dropping 0.3%.

Excluding autos, manufacturing rose 0.1%. Production at factories declined 1.7% on a year-on-year basis in October.

RBI tightens consumer loan norms

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tightened norms for personal loans and credit cards in the form of higher capital requirements. The central bank has raised the risk weights for lenders and non-bank financial companies (NBFCs), or the capital that banks need to set aside for every loan, by 25 percentage points to 125% on retail loans.

In the preceding trading session, the Nifty 50 exhibited a notable rally of 1.19%. In today's session, the bullish momentum persisted as it further gained 0.46%, reaching a level of 19,765.20, inching closer to the crucial 20,000 mark.

This rally was fueled by positive global and domestic cues, with notable factors including the drop in the US inflation rate to 3.2% in October. This development heightened optimism about a more measured approach by the US Federal Reserve to future rate hikes.

The fall in US 10-year yields to 4.5% and a substantial drop in the US Dollar Index further contributed to the market's bullish momentum. In India, October's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation eased to 4.87%, the lowest in four months.

Additionally, declining crude oil prices (Brent Crude), down 5.91% in October and an additional 4.56% this month, provided support to the markets. Notably, Brent crude futures plummeted 1.56% in the previous trading session on the back of larger-than-anticipated increase in U.S. crude inventories.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), on the other hand, turned net buyers on Wednesday after a series of selling sessions.

Among sectoral indices, the Nifty IT index experienced a significant surge due to easing inflation concerns in the US and UK. This development instilled confidence among investors, leading to expectations of increased demand from these regions. Given that a substantial portion of IT company revenues are closely tied to the US and UK markets, this positive sentiment had a notable impact.

Over the last two trading sessions, the Nifty IT index recorded an impressive rally of 5.34%, reaching the 32,273 level, coming closer to the 52-week high level of 33,402. Remarkably, all 10 constituents of the index concluded the last sessions in positive territory.

Commenting on the recent performance of the Indian market, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said,"" The Indian market continued its positive resurgence, tracking global gains. Softer than expected US inflation data and easing bond yields has bought optimism that spending will emerge like in technology.""

""Taking the cues further, IT stocks have shown a significant jump in the broader market. The market is sensing that export-based sectors like IT and pharma could be future winners. While cut in inflation will also benefits domestic placed staples and consumer sector,"" he added.

9,mint,Indian economy to grow 6.7.1% during 2024-2026: S&P,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-gdp-to-grow-6-7-1-during-2024-2026-global-headwinds-sp-11700131697777.html,16 Nov 2023,,"India's economic growth prospects should remain strong over the medium term, with GDP expanding 6-7.1 per cent annually in fiscal years 2024-2026, S&P Global Ratings said on Thursday.

In a report titled 'Global Banks Country-By-Country Outlook 2024', S&P said the banking sector's weak loans will decline to 3-3.5 per cent of gross advances by March 31, 2025, on the back of structural improvement, including healthy corporate balance sheets, tighter underwriting standards and improved risk-management practices.

Interest rates in India are unlikely to rise materially, and this should limit the risk for the banking industry, it added.

""Unsecured personal loans have grown rapidly and could contribute to incremental NPLs. We believe underwriting standards for retail loans generally remain healthy and overall level of delinquencies remains within acceptable limits for this product category,"" S&P Primary Credit Analyst Deepali Seth Chhabria said.

The report said that global uncertainties will have a lesser impact on the Indian economy.

Slower global growth and external demand will weigh on economic activity and could fuel further inflation. However, given that India is domestically oriented, the agency expects the economic growth to be less affected, it added.

""Economic growth momentum to continue. India's economic growth prospects should remain strong over the medium term, with GDP expanding 6-7.1 per cent annually in fiscal years 2024-2026,"" S&P said.

India's real GDP rose 7.8 per cent year-on-year in the June quarter, up from 6.1 per cent in the March quarter.

The Reserve Bank of India has forecast a 6.5 per cent economic growth for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 fiscal years.

The report further said that the State Bank of India and the leading private-sector banks have largely addressed their asset-quality challenges.

Many public-sector banks still carry relatively high volumes of weak assets, which will result in higher credit losses and hit profitability; their performance lags that of the industry.

This propelled the stock to achieve a substantial gain of 90% in the current year. Looking at the last three-year performance, the stock delivered a multi-bagger return of 242%.

The company is one of the leading manufacturers of critical high-precision gears, shafts, and transmission components, and it is one of the very few component manufacturers catering to diverse segments of automobiles and engines.

In its recently released Q2FY24 earnings report, the company reported a 9.6% YoY decline in revenue, reaching ‚Çπ284 crore. The reduction in the revenue from the previous year was primarily attributed to lower demand in the passenger car (PC) and two-wheeler segments in the standalone business, along with reduced offtake by a key customer in the North American business.

Breaking down the revenue share in Q2-FY24, the standalone business comprised two-wheelers (TW) at approximately 38%, commercial vehicles (CV), agriculture, and off-road at 43%, and passenger car (PC) at around 19%.

Despite the reduction in sales, profitability has improved significantly in the overseas operations. This improvement was driven by increased operator productivity through automation, layout modifications, and a reduction in headcount, resulting in a lower break-even point. Internal efficiency enhancements were also observed in areas such as repair and maintenance expenses, rejection rates, insurance costs, consumables, and tools, according to the company's Q2 earnings report.

The substantial increase in other income, reaching ‚Çπ78 crore, has propelled a remarkable YoY gain of 1962% in net profit, totaling ‚Çπ72 crore for Q2FY24.

According to the ICRA, the demand for the passenger vehicles segment is expected to grow by 6‚Äì9%, commercial vehicles by 7‚Äì10%, two-wheelers by 6‚Äì9%, and tractors by 4‚Äì6% in FY 2023‚Äì24.

11,mint,Trade deficit balloons to record high of $31.46 billion in October,https://www.livemint.com/economy/october-trade-data-trade-deficit-up-18-yoy-at-31-46-billion-from-26-3-billion-11700037160050.html,15 Nov 2023,,"New Delhi: India's merchandise trade deficit widened to a record high in October because of a sharp rise in gold imports during the festive season and a higher oil bill even as exports reported an annual rise during the month, official data released on Wednesday showed.

The trade deficit widened to $31.46 billion last month, with imports at $65.03 billion and exports at $33.57 billion, according to data from the ministry of commerce and industry. This was higher than the expected figure from a Reuters poll, in which economists predicted a deficit of $20.50 billion.

During October 2022 the trade deficit stood at $26.31 billion, with imports standing at $57.91 billion and exports at $31.60 billion. During September 2023, merchandise exports were $34.47 billion, while imports stood at $53.84 billion.

Indian exports have been affected by a slowdown in global growth, especially in the advanced economies of the West. These countries are also seeing tightening of interest rates due to nagging inflation, leading to a slowdown in business and trade. Meanwhile, conflicts in Ukraine and Israel have push oil prices higher, leading to greater inflationary pressures.

According to a commerce ministry official, gold imports rose by 95% on an annual basis during October, which led to the ballooning of the trade deficit. In October gold imports totalled $7.23 billion, according to Reuters.

The huge rise in gold imports during October was due to the Diwali festival in November. Diwali was celebrated in October last year, and there difference in dates accounted for the huge jump in gold imports in 2023, commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal said at a press briefing following the release of the trade data.

""We are seeing that green shoots are stabilising. This is happening despite a fall in commodity prices,"" Barthwal said. ""If green shoots stabilise (further), it augurs well for our exports,"" he added.

Brent crude prices rose substantially during October from the same period last year. The price stood at $92.63 a barrel during on 3 October, 2023, up from $ 89 on 3 October, 2022. Meanwhile, the Indian rupee fell by about 2.47% against the US dollar over the same period.

During October, services exports stood at $28.70 billion, while imports were $14.32 billion, compared to $29.37 billion worth of exports and $14.91 billion of imports in the previous month.

The higher-than-anticipated merchandise trade deficit was on account of higher spending on gold and oil, with exports broadly coming in on expected lines, experts said.

""Gold imports have risen by over 90%, which may push jewellery exports in the next few months but rising imports indicate that profiling of imports needs to be evaluated to find the impact of it on manufacturing and economy,"" said Ajay Sahay, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.

The rupee is expected to remain under pressure with the trade deficit rising, while capital inflows, which have been dampening over the past two years, may also take time to pick up owing to higher interest rates, said Biswajit Dhar, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

""If we keep piling on our trade deficit, the terms of borrowing will become tougher. Though going ahead the trade deficit outlook will depend on how we manage our manufacturing sectors. At present, the inability of the manufacturing sectors to find higher exports is a cause of concern. We have to find ways to improve our exports,"" Dhar added.

India's top merchandise export destinations during April-October 2023 were the US, the UAE, Netherlands, China and the UK, while top import sources were China, Russia, the UAE, the US and Saudi Arabia, according to official data.

Meanwhile, a senior commerce ministry official said the UK, which is currently negotiating a free trade agreement with India, could be seeking duty cuts for its electric vehicles.

""The UK will be phase out ICE vehicles by 2035 and shift focus to electric vehicles. It will be looking for export markets as it exports 80% of what it manufacturers,"" the official said, requesting anonymity.

At present, there is high engagement between India and the UK to iron out differences regarding the FTA, with the majority of chapters either closed or at an advanced stage of negotiations.

12,mint,"India's growth story is based on economic strength, not BJP winning elections",https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-growth-story-is-based-on-economic-strength-not-bjp-winning-elections-11700027779927.html,15 Nov 2023,,"Brokerage house Morgan Stanley has said that it expects heightened volatility in India's stock market after poll results are declared in December for five states, ‚Äúespecially if the BJP loses a majority of those states"". Volatility, the report suggests, could shoot up again after that if ‚Äúin the 2024 general elections the opposition alliance, called I.N.D.I.A., succeeds in polarizing voters, thus reducing the predictability of the outcome in May next year"".

‚ÄúElections have the propensity to create extreme outcomes for the stock market. Historically, the market has favored continuity and a majority government, as this implies limited policy shifts post elections. In the event, if the results go against the market's preferred outcome, we see the possibility for a draw down of 30%,"" the Morgan Stanley note said.

Similar commentary earlier on Indian elections was debunked in 2014 by economists, led by Prof. Maitreesh Ghatak of London School of Economics. It would be instructive to recall that the stock market had crashed in May 2004 after the Lok Sabha results were declared and it became clear that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government led by prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee would not continue in office, and a coalition government with the Left as a member would succeed it.

Yet, the first term of the UPA government saw unprecedented GDP growth of more than 9% year after year, with stock market returns recovering smartly, proving the initial fears of investors to be a momentary overreaction.

The economists led by Ghatak wrote in this note published in 2014 that the idea that the BJP is a more market-friendly party than the Congress (a prominent member of the INDIA alliance) has very little evidence supporting it at least in terms of capital flows.

In the six years of BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) rule from April 1998 to April 2004, the Sensex, these economists wrote, grew at compound annual growth rate of 5.9% per year. During the years under the United Progressive Alliance's (UPA) regime, this rate more than doubled to more than 16.4%. Even adjusting for inflation, which was high in the UPA years, capital gains and stock market returns during the coalition government of the UPA‚Äôs term in office were superior than those during the NDA government‚Äôs term, showing that the stock market‚Äôs (or was it FIIs that had greater sway in those days over the stock market sentiment?) apprehensions were unfounded.

Incidentally, FII inflows that were less than $3 billion a year during the NDA government, swelled to more than $25 billion a year during the UPA government‚Äôs second tenure.

Infrastructure investment as a percentage of GDP was higher during the UPA years (7-8%) than the NDA years (5%). More importantly, UPA government years saw private capital inflows into infrastructure. For instance, the Delhi airport was privatized during the UPA government‚Äôs term. Also, the private investment rate as a percentage of GDP had hit a high of more 34% during the UPA government‚Äôs term, something that has not been possible again.

Given this background, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs endeavor to link stock market returns to electoral outcomes in the upcoming state and then Lok Sabha elections next year is odd, to say the least. There‚Äôs little evidence that investors allow politics to influence their stock market decisions. Morgan Stanley‚Äôs note says that a potential change in government could lead to changes in the direction of policy reform and execution leading to poor investment sentiment. This seems like an overblown worry.

It should be clear to any long-term observer ‚Äî and Morgan Stanley certainly is one ‚Äî of India‚Äôs economic success that the draw for investors, especially domestic investors that hold more sway than their foreign counterparts today than any time in the past, is the inherent strength of the India Growth Story, not bias in favour or against any political outfit. Especially so when hardly any other large economy holds out as much promise as India for quick-paced development and stock market returns.

Investors are acutely aware that successive governments in New Delhi, regardless of their politics, have shown remarkable continuity since 1991 towards the broad economic policy thrust, resulting in consistently improving GDP growth performance that makes India stand out in its peer group, with an expanding consumption base and private investment engine.

The consistency and continuity of economic policy, both when reforms get done and when they don‚Äôt, can be seen from the fact that the difficult reforms such as privatisation of banks, shifting the urea subsidy to the Nutrient Based System, and farm laws remain pending even after consecutive terms for the majority BJP government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. All the same, this government was able to carry through the reforms initiated by the UPA government such as inflation targeting, decontrol of diesel and petrol retail prices, widening of financial inclusion, and shifting welfare spending to the direct benefit transfers mode."

The Wall Street brokerage expects India's real economic growth to be 6.5% in 2023 and 6.3% in 2024 - the highest among large economies in the region, but slightly below the Indian central bank's target of 6.5% for fiscal 2024.

The benchmark Nifty 50 jumped about 31% between March 2021 and October 2023, a period during which domestic investors remained net buyers each month, helping tide over sustained sales by foreign investors.

While the domestic participation was a healthy sign, said Goldman, it also noted the market's surge has pushed valuations to an elevated 20 times the next 12 month's expected earnings.

Still, that valuation had some support after earnings growth of 17% in 2023, the brokerage said.

The performance of the Nifty Midcap100 and NiftySmallcap100 index has been strong at 32% & 37%, respectively, led by a revamp in retail inflow in the latter half of the Samvat. The retail flow was from both the direct category and through mutual fund. Meanwhile, large-cap stocks delivered a steady positive return, the Nifty100 index is 8%.

Going ahead, we expect large caps to perform better. Firstly, because the valuation scenario for India has become mixed, where midcaps exhibit higher valuations, small caps comparatively moderate but at the mid high-range, and large caps trading aligned with the long-term average and the trend suggests a positive trajectory.

Also read: Diwali Muhurat Trading today: Timings, details & all you need to know

Secondly, of notable significance, large caps earnings growth in H1 has been robust, with high double-digit growth of 30 to 35%, based on the Q2 results announced till date. Despite this impressive earnings performance, the stock performance of India& large-cap index, exemplified by the Nifty100, remains in the low double digits. Foreseeing a narrowing in the peer performance between mid to large caps over the next six months, we posit that large caps are positioned for superior performance. This expectation is also underpinned by resilience in overcoming the ongoing global economic challenges.

The principal insight from 2079 underscores the outperformance of Midcaps beyond initial expectations. Broad market has yield positive returns, but the year was characterized by inherent volatility, a perennial aspect of equity. Consequently, a continual reassessment of stocks, economic conditions, industry dynamics, and geopolitical factors, inclusive of qualitative aspects such as behavioural research, was imperative to evaluate portfolio. And thirdly, a proactive approach was needed to withdraw & churn funds, whether in profit or loss, across stocks, industries, and assets. This dynamic strategy had to be done by assessing key indicators like bond yield, money supply, inflation, and valuation suggesting shift in risk.

For 2080 Samvat, we feel that India is in a good position to invest in multiple assets like Equity, Bonds, Gold, and Cash. The country is in a safe zone and can generate a decent return in each category; hence diversification and risk reduction should be utilised. The Indian economy is forecast to grow based on reform and inbuild domestic demand. Valuation is neither expensive nor cheap. So, we need to be stock and sector-specific in equities. And Debt is also generating a decent yield of minimum 7% for sovereign to 11.25% A rating bond papers. Gold also has a positive view due to INR depreciation, a slowdown in the global economy, stable demand in India, and high geopolitical tension, gold has contra relationship with risk. An average risk averse investor can invest 40% in equity, 40% in Debt and 20% in Gold.

Key global factors to be watched in 2080 Samvat are the interest rate cycle and geopolitical tension. Our understanding is that bond yields are expected to stay in the ongoing high ranges during 2023-24, with a marginal negative slope due to a drop in inflation. This is negative for equity but positive for Debt in terms of regular income and upside in NAV. But economic growth is forecast to slowdown and constant hitches are expected in geopolitical tension, though both the Ukraine and Israel wars are showcasing improvements in the situation. However, a leeway in the trend of crude prices is likely, which should be positive for India. Thirdly, central election, historical trends indicate that elections in both India and the US typically trigger short-term knee-jerk reactions or consolidation. This is often attributed to a slowdown in decision-making, government spending, and the transition of leadership. While a change in leadership in the US is not anticipated to significantly impact the global market, but in India, a change could potentially exert a profound influence on the ongoing reformist rally, a scenario that is not currently forecasted.

We have a target of 21,000 for Nifty50 for the next year, Dec 2024, which translate to 70,000 for Sensex, indicating that we can expect a broad positive return of around 8% from here on. Our focus in 2080 Samvat will be on large cap with a focus on domestic demand like consumption, manufacturing, infra and energy, which can provide a better return compared to a broad market. Additionally, we recommend adopting an accumulation strategy for export-oriented sectors, including IT, Pharma, and Chemical, for long-term investors.

According to the poll, the volatile food prices have probably moderated after a spike in July and August. Though the prices of onions are still rising sharply.

The consumer price index (CPI) was at an annual rate of 4.80 percent in October, slower than 5.02 percent in September, as per the November 6-9 Reuters poll of 53 economists.

Forecasts for the data, to be released on Monday, were in a 4.47-5.55 percent range, said the report.

Despite a strong majority expected inflation to be lower than what it was in September, about 20 percent of economists said the inflation rate had risen.

""I'm expecting a further slide in inflation in October, thanks primarily to a continued moderation in food inflation. Underlying our forecast is a fall in food and beverage inflation to below 6%,"" Reuters quoted Miguel Chanco, chief emerging Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, as saying.

""Beyond October, I wouldn't be surprised if there is some stickiness in the headline rate, particularly if the ongoing increase in onion prices persists. But stickiness is very different from surge and I don't expect any breach of the target range in the foreseeable future,"" Chanco added.

The slower pace of price rises may give some comfort to the RBI, however, anchoring inflation to the 4 percent mid-point target is still some distance away.

As per the separate Reuters survey, The RBI is expected to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 6.50% at least until end-June 2024 before cutting it by 25 basis points in the following quarter.

Also, the headline inflation was not expected to return to the RBI's mid-point target at least until the second half of 2025.

""Inflation is expected to have a choppy ride in the months ahead... Passage of base effects and a sharper rise in selected vegetable prices are likely to take the headline back above 5% this quarter and keep in that territory into 1Q24,"" the news agency quoted Radhika Rao, senior economist at DBS Bank, as saying.

""The central bank has opted to be cautious on the inflation outlook...(and) will be more inclined to extend its pause for the time being before venturing out to consider a change in stance as a precursor to a change in the policy direction,"" she added.

What RBI said:

Earlier on 20 October, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in the minutes that the major focus of the monetary policy committee (MPC) will be on aligning inflation to its target of 4 percent. The fundamental goal of the RBI is to align inflation to the target and control inflation expectations, he had added.

""Our fundamental goal is to align inflation with the 4% target and anchor inflation expectations,"" Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das said.

The company has a strong focus on customers and will continue to gain a further increase in the realisation. Airtel's business fundamentals remain strong and continue to improve and the management foresees huge potential for continued strong revenue and profit growth, supported by expanding distribution in rural areas, investments in the network, and increasing 4G coverage, added the brokerage.

FY24/FY25 will be critical for the company as it executes its EV strategy for the domestic and export markets, said Axis. (MINT_PRINT)

3/9APL Apollo Tubes: Axis has a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô rating on the stock with a target price of ‚Çπ 1,950, which implies an over 21% upside. As per the brokerage, the incremental production from the Raipur plant will drive higher EBITDA/t from ‚Çπ 5k/t to ‚Çπ 6-7k/t in 2-3 years. Furthermore, the company‚Äôs market-creation efforts have brought more orders from railway stations and airports for heavy structural and coated products. These new projects provide demand visibility for the company over the next few years. Also, with a lower capex intensity ahead, higher OCFs, and the Raipur plant stabilising in due course, the company‚Äôs ROCE is likely to improve from 27% in FY24 to 37% by FY26, it added.

4/9Jyothy Labs: The brokerage has a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendation on the pharma stock with a target price of ‚Çπ 440, implying an upside of over 6%. The company's recent initiatives, implemented over the last couple of years, have begun yielding positive results, and Axis expects these benefits to extend over the coming years. Axis expects the company‚Äôs EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16-17% for FY24-26 which will be driven by improving product mix, better on-ground execution, and focus on cost rationalisation measures, it said. Axis expects the company to deliver healthy Revenue/EBITDA/PAT growth of 13%/25%/25% CAGR over FY23-26E, respectively, which will elevate the company‚Äôs overall return profile. It also estimates its ROE to increase from 15% in FY23 to 21% in FY26.

5/9HDFC Bank: Axis has a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô rating on the private sector lender stock with a target price of ‚Çπ 1,800, which implies an almost 21% upside. The brokerage remains confident in the bank‚Äôs ability to sustain its growth momentum given the enormous opportunity post the merger in terms of a larger customer base, larger distribution network, and higher cross-sell opportunities to existing customers of HDFC. Moreover, it believes the current valuations, too, are reasonable and below the long-term average. A key concern for the merged entity was the pressure on margins, which was visible in Q2FY24. While near-term margins will continue to face headwinds, Axis expects recovery from FY25E onwards. Despite margin pressures, the management remains confident of delivering RoA between 1.9% and 2.1%, similar to the historical performance of the standalone bank, it added. (Bloomberg)

6/9Astral: The brokerage has a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendation on the stock with a target price of ‚Çπ 2,150, implying an upside of over 13%. Astral is a manufacturer of Chlorinated Poly Vinyl Chloride (CPVC) and Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) plumbing systems catering to both residential and industrial use. The management expects strong demand to continue and increased its FY24 volume guidance from 15%+ YoY to 20%+ YoY. The company has also increased advertisement spending by 22% which is 3% of sales. The brokerage is bullish on the firm on the back of encouraging growth opportunities and gradual gaining of market share.

7/9Ahluwalia Contracts: The brokerage has a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô call on the stock with a target price of ‚Çπ 770, indicating an upside of 13%. With favorable attributes such as a strong and diversified order book position, healthy bidding pipeline, new order inflows, its asset-light model, and emerging opportunities in the construction space, Axis expects the company to generate healthy free cash flows moving ahead and deliver Revenue/EBITDA/APAT growth of 23%/26%/27% CAGR over FY23-FY25E. It further added that the company exhibits a strong financial position reflected in its debt-free status, high cash/bank balance (12% of market cap), and high return ratio. Furthermore, the government‚Äôs higher focus on infra will keep the company‚Äôs order inflow intake robust moving ahead.

8/9SBI Life Insurance: Axis has a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô rating on the life insurance stock with a target price of ‚Çπ 1,535, which implies a 14% upside. SBI Life continues to maintain its leadership position with the best in the industry cost ratios. The company has been able to deliver strong APE growth over the past years and the brokerage expects the momentum to continue with a more balanced product mix. The company‚Äôs channel productivity continues to improve and the focus on improving productivity in the agency channel should yield results in the coming quarters, said Axis. It estimates margins to range between 28.5% and 29% over FY24-25E and expects APE growth to remain strong at ~17-18% over the medium term."
17,mint,Can Indian market's strong run continue? Here's what Morgan Stanley predicts,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/can-indian-markets-strong-run-continue-heres-what-morgan-stanley-predicts-11699429541174.html,08 Nov 2023,,"The strong Indian economy and rally in the market have investors questioning whether this bull run can continue. Morgan Stanley believes it can.

""We have been constructive on India‚Äôs outlook for some time, highlighting that India offers the best domestic demand alpha opportunity within Asia and one of the best structural stories over the medium term globally. A wide variety of growth indicators suggest that the economy is doing well. Investors we speak to are generally bullish and this has been reflected in a strong run in asset markets so far,"" it said.

Given this backdrop, the brokerage noted that the debate with investors is usually centered around what can sustain or derail the positive narrative on India.

""In our view, the most important driver to sustain growth and asset market performance is the investment cycle. To be sure, the investment cycle has already been inflected, driven initially by a sharp upturn in public capex. There are signs that private capex is picking up. It has been the shift in policy approach since 2019 towards supply-side reforms (acceleration in public capex, cutting corporate taxes, and the introduction of the PLI scheme as key pivots) and reduced emphasis on redistribution, which has attracted investment, unlocked the structural growth story,"" explained MS in a report.

In the report, it has addressed five common points of debates on India by cautious investors. Let's take a look:

Debate #1: Will higher US rates trigger a resumption of rate hikes?

As per the brokerage, when assessing the exposure of each economy to higher US rates, two factors matter ‚Äì the starting point of bond yields and current account balances. Low yielders without the buffer of a sizeable current account surplus are therefore most exposed on this framework. In India's case, it noted that India‚Äôs policy rates are appropriately calibrated.

""Based on this framework, when we look at India‚Äôs inflation and current account balance, these macro stability indicators are in a comfortable position. Hence we do believe that policy rates are set at the right level and we don‚Äôt foresee the need for further tightening in our base case,"" it explained.

The brokerage pointed out that India's CPI inflation had breached the upper end of RBI‚Äôs target band in July and August on account of higher food prices, which raised investor concern about whether RBI would have to hike rate again to bring inflation back under control. However, the vegetable prices that spiked and led to this acceleration in inflation were of a short-duration nature and their prices have since reversed. Over the coming quarters, MS India economist, Upasana Chachra, expects that headline inflation will remain within the target range. It is against this backdrop that the brokerage doesn‚Äôt foresee a resumption of rate hikes.

Commenting on the current account deficit (CAD), MS informed that over the past 4 quarters, India‚Äôs CAD had been staying with the comfort zone ‚Äì 2.5 percent of GDP ‚Äì despite a robust expansion. MS India economist Upasana Chachra projects that the current account deficit will remain below 2 percent of GDP in both F24 and F25, suggesting that it will be well within the comfort zone and should not give rise to external funding concerns.

Moreover, while the rise in US rates over the last four months did put some pressure on most EM currencies, the rupee has been less volatile and MS believes a combination of improved macro stability and structural reforms supporting healthy capital inflows protected the trends in balance of payments.

Debate #2: What level of oil prices would stretch macro stability indicators beyond the comfort zone?

Any rise in oil prices tends to bring concerns about India‚Äôs macro stability indicators, believes MS.

""India remains a net oil importer with an oil trade balance of -2.6 percent of GDP. Within the region, India is one of the more exposed economies to higher oil prices, with every $10 rise in oil prices imparting a 50bps upside to inflation and could contribute to a 30bps widening of the current account balance. Moreover, this is compounded by the issue that inflation is still 1% point above the mid-point of the target band and that India tends to run a current account deficit,"" stated MS.

Currently, retail fuel prices are already marked to market at $90/bbl, so they have not had to be adjusted. Meanwhile, if oil prices were to be sustained around $95/bbl, the overall impact on India‚Äôs macro stability would be manageable but the upside to inflation would likely mean a delay to RBI‚Äôs shallow rate cut cycle, which MS had pegged for the start of Q2FY24. MS commodity strategist Martjin Rats expects oil prices to rise to $95/bbl in Q4 but to decline into 2024.

However, it warned that the risk arises if oil prices rise above $110/bbl in a sustained manner. Under this scenario, while there would still be some fiscal subsidisation, it believes that the pass-through to domestic fuel prices will increase. As adjustments to retail fuel prices are taken up, there will be upward pressures on inflation. Moreover, sustained higher oil prices would also mean that the current account deficit would likely widen beyond 2.5 percent of GDP, it added. With macro stability indicators stretched under this scenario, it predicts currency depreciation pressures could rise and lead RBI to restart its rate hike cycle.

Debate #3: Will infrastructure and skilled labour bottlenecks emerge as a constraint to the growth story?

This debate is more a medium-term one, said the brokerage. It believes that such constraints may potentially emerge in the next 18-24 months if the growth cycle continues to be strong. Policymakers are already taking a number of measures to increase infrastructure spending in a coordinated manner with the aim of reducing logistics costs. However, some bottlenecks will emerge and hence, taking these challenges into account, the brokerage has a realistic growth forecast of 6.5 percent on average over the coming decade. If the government does take up even more concerted efforts to expand the infrastructure network, there could be an upside to its growth estimates.

""The most critical component is to build up infrastructure in a timely manner that would improve logistical efficiency and bring down costs. In particular, resolving constraints related to the energy sector and the provision of electricity will be critical as India is building up its manufacturing base. Looking ahead, given the scale of infrastructure investments needed, we believe that there needs to be an immense amount of planning to ensure the seamless execution and rollout of infrastructure,"" MS noted.

For labor, the brokerage commented that continued human capital accumulation is needed to complement the expansion in industrial capacity expansion to sustain the growth trajectory. As is the case with infrastructure, there is progress from policy efforts to strengthen vocational training and further improve literacy rates. Over the medium term, MS sees some friction emerging on this front but as employment demand picks up, the government, corporations and workers are likely to respond, it added.

Debate #4: Why are FDI inflows slowing?

FDI inflows into India have declined from a peak of $70 billion on a Q4 trailing basis in 2Q21 to $33 billion in Q2FY23. With global GDP and trade growth softening, global FDI flows have softened, noted MS. Moreover, there are some sector-specific factors, such as funding for the internet and related sectors (from venture capital and private equity standpoint), that have slowed and are weighing on the aggregates, it added.

Another thing to note, it said, is that there are some implementation lags, where announcements have been made, but the actual investment has not yet flowed through. For instance, there is incoming newsflow on electronic manufacturing investment commitments coming from companies like Foxconn (which as per media reports had announced several billion in investments) and Intel recently announced its collaboration with eight companies to manufacture laptops in India, it further mentioned.

Debate #5: Will a weak coalition government lead to a shift in the favourable policy mix?

As per the brokerage, the constructive narrative on India is dependent on a continued focus on supply-side reforms. A continuation of this would be linked to the election outcomes. Maintaining policy stability will be key to keeping foreign and domestic corporate sector confidence buoyant, it noted.

""It is against this backdrop where MS believes that a stable, majority government will be able to continue to push through policy reforms, in order to sustain the shift in boosting private investment. This naturally turns the attention to the upcoming state elections this month and the general elections in May 2024. In our view, the key risk would be the emergence of a weak coalition government, which could result in a pivot back towards redistributive policies at the expense of the focus on boosting capex and implementing supply-side reforms,"" it cautioned.

According to Ridham Desai, MS Head of India Research and Equity Strategy, markets are seemingly pricing in an outcome of policy continuity, and he highlights that equity markets could turn lower in other scenarios.

Bottomline: India still the best domestic demand alpha opportunity

MS expects India's growth to be sustained at a healthy clip of 6.4 percent in F2024 and 6.5 percent in F2025, averaging 6.6 percent over F2024-28.

""India‚Äôs importance as a global growth driver will increase, with its share of global growth contribution has risen from 10 percent in 2021 to 15 percent in 2022, and further to 17 percent in 2023-28. On a USD basis, we expect India‚Äôs nominal GDP growth to accelerate to 12.4 percent in F2025 (vs 7 percent in F2024), outperforming China, the US and the Euro Area. The high terminal growth rate will mean India‚Äôs economy will compound at a strong rate on a high base. We expect nominal GDP will reach $5 trillion by 2027, making India the world‚Äôs third-largest economy,"" it forecasts.

19,mint,Riding back in time with Bharat Atta,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/why-the-government-shouldn-t-interfere-with-healthy-markets-11699355253286.html,08 Nov 2023,,"There‚Äôs more than a hint of deja vu with the launch of Bharat Atta in 2023. It‚Äôs as if the world‚Äôs fastest-growing large economy is suddenly regressing to a past socialistic pattern ‚Äì one in which the state produced and sold Hindustan Salt, Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT) and Modern Bread. The government must draw a line beyond which it will not intervene in the economy, especially in the food sector, the distorting impact of which is well recognised.

Yes, ensuring food security for India‚Äôs large vulnerable population is essential. India took major strides towards this decades ago with the green revolution of the 1960s, measures such as procuring and maintaining enormous and costly stocks of foodgrains, and an elaborate public distribution system (PDS). To exempt its huge stocks of foodgrains from trade-distorting measures, India has fought off pressure from grain-exporting rich countries and wrecked consensus at multiple meetings of the World Trade Organisation.

The government runs a National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, essentially a dole, in which the requirement of manual work functions as a screening mechanism to weed out the non-poor. It ensures the poor have the purchasing power to buy grains from the PDS even in the lean season for farm work. The government has been distributing free grains at the rate of 5 kg (10 kg during the pandemic) per person per month to some 80 crore Indians (57% of the population). The prime minister recently announced at an election rally that this will continue for another five years. Is India so poor that more than half the population cannot buy food?

The scheme will cost some ‚Çπ2 trillion a year. The outlay for the rural employment guarantee scheme has been close to ‚Çπ1 trillion in the past couple of years. Now, the government has launched packaged wheat flour at a discount of ‚Çπ6-7 a kg to the market price. Are cookies, bread and noodles on the way, apart from Garib Kalyan kurta-pyjama?

If people have access to subsidised flour and free grain, many are likely to sell it back to the government under its procurement scheme for farmers. After all, how much grain can an individual eat?

What began as the Indian planning system‚Äôs desire to create strategic capability in a sector when private players were too small soon degenerated into mindless licence-permit raj that bred corruption, hindered innovation and progress, and stalled entrepreneurship by limiting access to capital and technology to influential industrialists.

In the era of Nehruvian socialism, Air India, owned by the Tatas, was nationalised and eventually run to the ground. It was handed back to the Tatas a year ago for a paltry sum, while taxpayers will continue to pay its accumulated debts. In the Indira Gandhi phase of socialism, banks, airlines and cloth mills were nationalised. This has not been reversed despite the Modi government announcing its intention to privatise nationalised banks several times. Car manufacturing and luxury hotels began in the state sector, while telecom was a state monopoly. BSNL, formerly Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, has received ‚Çπ3.22 trillion of taxpayer money in the past four years alone because it doesn‚Äôt even earn enough to pay salaries and pensions.

Liberalisation in 1991 reversed many of these mistakes, opening up most sectors to private entrepreneurship. The economy benefited from increased competition, innovation and market expansion, leading to a virtuous cycle of new investment, increased capacity and yet more entrepreneurship. Modern Breads was privatised.

But it seems we‚Äôre now back to square one.

When the government enters the market for flour, it does two things. Firstly, it fails to use the earmarked funds and administrative resources for things that the state alone can do to enhance systemic efficiency and productivity. These include better law and order, helping India achieve a more respectable ranking on the list of the worst countries for contract enforcement, and greater investment in high-risk sectors such as quantum communications that the private sector is unwilling to undertake.

Secondly, it undermines the existing trade in flour. Food-processing companies, large or small, will be hurt by this. Smaller operators could shut down, while large players may be able to absorb the losses for a while. The net result will be greater concentration and oligopolistic power in the market for wheat and flour.

The government should stop meddling in sectors in which private companies are eminently competitive. Its interventions in the farm sector should focus on restructuring the incentives that currently lead to overproduction of grain, underproduction of edible oil seeds, depletion of groundwater, erosion of soil quality, and production of crops far away from agroclimatic regions best suited to them. A prime example of this is sugarcane being grown in arid Maharashtra and not on the floodplains of Bihar.

A worthy intervention by the government in the farm sector would be to control stubble burning ‚Äì a public good and a job that only the state can do. It should not cripple with irritational interventions markets that are working just fine."

In an interview with Mint, Lunawat said the IPO trend will continue in H2 2024, with a strong pipeline of over $9 billion. Edited excerpts:

What is driving the strong influx of IPOs in 2023?

Compared to most of the other major economies, India stands out distinctly as one of the bright spots in the world today.

In the primary capital market, we have witnessed many successful IPOs. We are no longer dependent on foreign institutions, as domestic institutions demonstrate increasing depth and maturity.

Moreover, 2023 was anticipated to be one of the prime years for IPOs, considering a long lineup. The strong influx of IPOs can be attributed to India's economic resilience and its attractiveness as an investment hub.

IPOs have become an entry point for first-time investors to venture into public offerings for listing gains. The capital market also showed a strong performance, largely supported by domestic capital accumulation.

Strong investor confidence can be seen in the secondary market, but it becomes even more evident in IPOs as new and interesting ideas come to the market.

Earlier very few sectors used to dominate the mainboard IPOs. However, in the recent past, there has been an upswing and we see IPOs from diverse sectors, such as small finance banks, biotechnology, supply chain management, apparel, jewellery, infrastructure, cable manufacturing, etc. What has led to this change?

With 1.4 billion people, India has the largest population in the world and as per the 2011 Census of India, tier II and tier III cities constitute 16.9 per cent of the urban population of India.

These small towns and cities play a pivotal role in the economic activity of the nation. They are responsible not only for the large production of the country‚Äôs crops but also have a significant presence in the manufacturing sector.

India is expected to have one of the lowest dependency ratios among regional economies for the next 20 years, making now the ideal moment to set up industrial, logistics, and technological infrastructure outside of major cities for global expansion.

India‚Äôs economy has now evolved for the better and the rise of entrepreneurship has led to business creation across sectors, especially in manufacturing, consumer electricals, and EV space.

Much of it can be attributed to Tier II and Tier III cities which are actively contributing towards reshaping the Indian economy beyond metros.

Regions like Rajkot, Udaipur, Surat and Nagpur among other regions from Madhya Pradesh and North are emerging as core areas with high-potential companies.

How are the pricing and valuations of upcoming IPOs and how are the sentiments amongst promoters and private equity players for taking companies public?

The current financial year is witnessing interesting IPOs and buoyant primary market activities.

After a slow start in 2023, the IPO market picked steam after the new financial year started in April. 31 mainboard IPOs hit stock exchanges between April‚Äô23 and September‚Äô23 as compared to 14 IPOs during the same period in previous years.

The IPO market has been buzzing this fiscal year. There have been fewer mega IPOs this year compared to last year, but a greater number of IPOs with smaller issue sizes.

The most active sectors in recent IPOs include hospitality and construction, automotive and transportation, diversified industrial products, and real estate.

Except for only four companies, every other IPO listed in this financial year gave positive listing gains.

All the IPOs managed by Pantomath Capital on the mainboard during the year 2023, viz, Plaza Wires, Sah Polymers, Aeroflex Industries and Vishnu Prakash R Punglia (VPRP), got featured in the list of top 10 most rewarding IPOs of this fiscal so far.

Aeroflex garnered the highest number of applications with more than 27 lakh applications. Pantomath has also closed another mainboard IPO, Plaza Wires on October 5 which has witnessed the highest subscription of over 160 times.

Also Read: New long-term growth story in Asia is India, not China, says Chris Wood of Jefferies

We have garnered gross subscription (before rejection) of more than ‚Çπ43,000 crore in both the IPOs of Aeroflex and VPRP. This level of participation demonstrates the market depth and also the favour primary issuances get from investors.

Notably, the subscription was fueled by institutional demand, which is even more encouraging. Besides, only eight of the 30 IPOs have given single-digit listing gains.

The rest all gave double-digit listing gains, hinting at a positive sentiment amongst promotors and PE players to go public.

Do you expect the IPO trend of the first half to continue in the second half (H2) of the year?

Yes, the trend will continue in H2 2024, with a strong pipeline of over $9 billion, approved by capital market regulator Sebi, and another $6 billion filed with the market watchdog. The second half of fiscal 2024 looks promising for the primary market.

Also Read: Q2 earnings in line so far, expect limited changes to current earnings estimates, says Vinit Sambre of DSP Mutual Fund

A strong inflow of capital in the primary market may cause a temporary scarcity of liquidity in the secondary market. What are your views on it?

Primary market and secondary market go hand-in-hand. It may not be appropriate to compare these two segments from a liquidity perspective.

Sometimes a mega offering could have a temporary impact on market liquidity but that‚Äôs a very temporary phenomenon. Moreover, we did not witness any mega IPO hitting the street, which could have a potential impact on market liquidity.

The Indian market has been deepening tremendously and past trends may no longer be relevant for forthcoming trends, especially those relating to liquidity.

Also Read: Cautious of headwinds to domestic demand; inflation to average 5.7% in 2023, says Aurodeep Nandi of Nomura

What should retail investors consider before deciding to invest in an IPO?

IPOs generally attract quite a lot of media attention, some of which is done on purpose by the firm going public.

IPOs are well-liked by investors due to their tendency to induce volatile price changes on the day of the IPO and shortly thereafter.

Significant losses as well as significant gains might occasionally result from this.

Investors should ultimately evaluate each IPO in light of their financial situation and risk appetite, as well as the prospectus of the company that is going public.

Investors must not follow the herd. Moreover, informal market pricing must not be the criterion.

Investors must read offer documents and other collaterals formally circulated by the issuer firm. It‚Äôs not a bad idea if investors consult expert investment advisors registered with Sebi, for investment advice.

21,mint,Industry leaders call for government support to boost sustainable growth,https://www.livemint.com/industry/industry-leaders-call-for-government-support-to-boost-sustainable-growth-11699102904470.html,04 Nov 2023,,"New Delhi: There is need for government intervention to advance Indian businesses' sustainability and competitive edge on a global scale, according to Abhyuday Jindal, managing director, Jindal Stainless. While Indian companies are internally robust, external factors like infrastructure and logistics costs, along with access to green energy, are areas where support is crucial, Jindal said.

Speaking at a panel discussion at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit 2023, Jindal said that moving towards sustainability is not just a regulatory compliance requirement, but a competitive necessity.

‚ÄúIf India now wants to be globally competitive, we have to move very fast on this measure. It will not only happen internally‚Ä¶when it comes to external factors like your infrastructure cost, logistics cost, access to clean energy sources, then the government really needs to step in. And that will make Indian companies competitive globally for a long period,"" he said.

Jindal added that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals are no longer subjects of discussion but the need of the hour, and although companies have begun moving in this direction, a lot remains to be done.

Nishant Arya, vice chairman of JBM Group, said that an adequate ecosystem is important for growth of sustainable and transition-related businesses to thrive. Arya pointed out India's status as a prime location for green investments, given its policy framework and corporate readiness to promote sustainability.

Stressing on the need for self-reliance in the journey towards sustainability and energy transition, Priya Agarwal Hebbar, chairperson, Hindustan Zinc, and non-executive director, Vedanta Ltd., said India could significantly support its net zero target of 2070 through domestic mineral production, leveraging the country's vast, yet largely untapped, natural resources.

‚ÄúWe need 3 billion tonne of metal for net zero. How are we going to make that happen? Do we want to spend all our money in importing all of that or are we going to do it ourselves? India is a country rich with natural resources. We have over 85 natural resources and less than 20% of that has been explored,"" she said.

Hebbar said that with the right technology, mining could be transformed into a completely sustainable industry, despite its reputation as environmentally challenging.

Arya lauded Indian companies for leading the global energy transition and stressed the importance of collaborative efforts among industry, policymakers, and academia to achieve significant progress in this area.

The discussion also touched on the increasing importance of ESG norms, which Hebbar noted have contributed to making sectors like mining more inclusive.

Jindal highlighted key sustainable sectors, predicting that electric mobility and the development of a hydrogen economy would be pivotal. He also projected that water conservation will become a major focal point in the near future.

This can be attributed to several key factors, which include:

Increased investor awareness and affinity for alternative investments: There has been a noticeable increase in investor awareness and a growing appetite for alternative investments. Assets like private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds offer the potential for higher returns compared to traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds, albeit with greater risk. As investors become more sophisticated and open to taking on increased risk, they are increasingly turning to alternative investments to diversify their portfolios and seek higher returns.

Robust growth of the Indian economy: India's economy stands as one of the fastest-growing major economies worldwide. This remarkable growth is spawning fresh investment opportunities that alternative investment funds are keen to explore and leverage.

Support from the regulatory environment: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has played a pivotal role in fostering the alternative investment industry's growth. In 2012, SEBI implemented the AIF regulations, consolidating various alternative investment funds under a unified regulatory framework, thus providing a conducive environment for their development.

In the preceding five years (from June FY19 to June FY24), the industry has experienced a remarkable Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 26%, resulting in impressive assets under management (AUM) of ‚Çπ13.74 lakh crore as of June FY24. This growth rate surpasses the mutual fund industry's performance, which registered a CAGR of 13% and managed an AUM of ‚Çπ46.63 lakh crore as of August 2023, highlighting the industry's growth at more than twice the rate.

Increasing income levels in India have expanded the accessibility of alternative investments to a broader spectrum of investors, encompassing high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNIs). Furthermore, the widespread dissemination of information regarding alternative investments, combined with the allure of diversification and enhanced returns, has contributed significantly to the industry's expansion.

Below is a more comprehensive breakdown of each of the factors:

Increasing income levels: As the Indian economy has surged, so have the incomes of its residents, resulting in an expanding pool of wealth seeking investment opportunities beyond conventional assets like stocks and bonds. Alternative investments such as private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds offer the prospect of superior returns, albeit accompanied by increased risk. High-Net-Worth Individuals and Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individuals typically represent more sophisticated investors ready to embrace greater risk to attain enhanced returns.

Information proliferation: Historically, information pertaining to alternative investments remained confined and accessible primarily to institutional investors. However, recent years have witnessed a proliferation of alternative investment information, primarily owing to the Internet and social media. This dissemination of knowledge has made alternative investments more attainable for individual investors, including HNIs and UHNIs.

Attraction of diversification and enhanced returns: Alternative investments extend investors the opportunity to diversify their portfolios and achieve superior returns in comparison to traditional asset classes. This results from the characteristic of alternative investments being typically uncorrelated or less correlated to traditional assets, which means they can perform well even when conventional asset classes are underperforming. Furthermore, alternative investments hold the potential to generate superior long-term returns compared to traditional asset classes.

The growth of the alternative investment industry in India signifies a positive development for the Indian economy, as it is poised to attract increased foreign investment, generate new employment opportunities, and bolster the growth of Indian enterprises.

Pallavarajan R, Founder & Director, PMS Bazaar, said, ‚ÄúIndia's rising affluence is driving HNIs to alternative investments (PMSs and AIFs), which offer lucrative opportunities, customized solutions, and transparent structures. AUM in these products has grown more than three times in five years, twice as fast as mutual funds. If the same pace of investments continues, in a favourable market, we anticipate the PMS and AIF industry to grow to ‚Çπ43.64 lakh crore by 2028. We believe that alternative products are becoming an essential part of the investment portfolios of India‚Äôs wealthy.""

India's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) situated in Gift City is steadily establishing itself as a prominent player in the realm of alternative investments. Gift City, a worldwide financial hub, presents numerous benefits to Alternative Investment Funds and other investors, including:

Supportive regulatory landscape: Gift City boasts a regulatory environment that favours AIFs. AIFs operating within Gift City enjoy exemptions from specific Indian taxes and regulations, rendering them more enticing to global investors.

Global connectivity: Gift City enjoys robust connectivity with various international financial centres, simplifying the process for AIFs to source and allocate capital on a global scale.

Gateway to Indian markets: Gift City serves as a gateway, affording AIFs access to the flourishing Indian markets, recognized as one of the world's swiftest-growing major economies.

Consequently, these advantages have prompted numerous AIFs, both from within India and internationally, to establish their operations in Gift City. The burgeoning presence of AIFs in Gift City plays a pivotal role in luring increased foreign investments into India and actively contributes to the maturation of the Indian alternative investment sector.

Vikaas M Sachdeva, MD & CEO, Sundaram Alternates, added, ‚ÄúGift City stands as a testament to India's commitment to becoming a global financial powerhouse. Its strategic initiatives have not only attracted international investors but have also provided domestic investors with unprecedented opportunities. As Gift City thrives, so does India's position in the world of alternative investments.""

The AIFs have emerged as pioneers in India's investment arena, showcasing a remarkable CAGR of 36% in the past five years. Among these, Category II AIFs, encompassing venture capital, private equity, real estate funds, and private credit, have enjoyed exponential expansion, largely propelled by the heightened enthusiasm of HNIs and UHNIs.

Even in the face of regulatory adjustments, such as an elevation in the minimum investment threshold, the PMS sector has demonstrated resilience, showcasing a formidable CAGR of 16%. By July 2023, the PMS industry's AUM had reached ‚Çπ5.29 lakh crore (exclusive of EPFO/PF/Advisory data).

The upsurge of the alternative investment industry in India stands as a favourable development for the Indian economy. It serves as a magnet for increased foreign investment, fosters the creation of fresh employment opportunities, and bolsters the growth of Indian enterprises.

Sunil Rohokale, MD & CEO, ASK Group, said, ‚ÄúIndia is at the cusp of a new credit cycle fuelled by private sector investment on the back of strong earnings growth within India Inc. This is further supported by robust economic activity across all major sectors driven by strong economic growth, government infrastructure spending as well as policy support, and a favourable demographic outlook. The opportunity for alternates is untapped and is at a very nascent stage, with the potential to grow beyond USD 300 billion. Investors will favour reputed, well-established, and institutionalised players with a good track record to be a part of their growth journey.""

Looking forward, the PMS and AIFs sector is anticipated to sustain its rapid expansion in the forthcoming years. Moreover, recent alterations in tax regulations concerning debt mutual funds (including the removal of the Long-Term Capital Gains indexation benefit) and insurance (entailing taxation of maturity proceeds for life insurance policies with premiums exceeding ‚Çπ5 lakh) are likely to be pivotal in driving the growth of the alternative assets industry. Additionally, with HNI investors increasingly recognizing the potential of alternative investments in terms of diversifying across asset classes and wealth accumulation, the demand for such financial products is projected to surge.

23,mint,"Indian firms may raise employee salaries by 9.8% in 2024, says WTW report; here's all about job market projections",https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/indian-firms-to-raise-employee-salaries-by-9-8-in-2024-wtw-report-11698839138108.html,01 Nov 2023,,"According to WTW‚Äôs Salary Budget Planning Report, Indian companies anticipate granting their employees a salary increase of approximately 9.8 per cent in 2024, a figure closely in line with the 10 per cent rise experienced in 2023. This places India at the forefront of the Asia Pacific region in terms of salary increments. The fact that Indian companies are poised to offer the most substantial salary increases in the Asia Pacific region in 2024, despite the global economic slowdown, represents a positive indicator for both the Indian economy and its workforce.

Several potential factors could account for this trend. Firstly, India‚Äôs status as a youthful and expanding economy, coupled with its substantial workforce, engenders intense competition for talent, thereby propelling salary increments. Secondly, a significant number of Indian firms operate within the technology and other fast-growing sectors, which tend to offer more substantial compensation packages. Lastly, the Indian government has implemented measures to foster business growth and job creation, contributing to economic advancement and a conducive backdrop for wage growth.

Explaining increased budgets for salary

The report pointed out that companies are revising their salary increase budgets for the coming year due to two key concerns: Tightening labour markets and escalating inflation.

In the context of tightening labour markets, companies find themselves engaged in fierce competition to both attract and retain top talent. This heightened competition is resulting in increased salary offers, as companies are becoming more willing to pay premium wages to secure the services of exceptional employees.

Concurrently, the upward trajectory of inflation is exerting additional strain on salary budgets. As the cost of living rises, employees naturally expect their salaries to keep pace. Consequently, employees are expressing higher salary expectations, compelling companies to respond by increasing salaries to a greater extent than they might have otherwise.

The report revealed that over half of the companies have expanded their salary budgets for the current year when compared to the figures from 2022, with a quarter of them surpassing the budget projections they had set in December 2022. This indicates a growing willingness among companies to provide more substantial salary hikes, even in the midst of economic uncertainty.

Technology, financial services and retail sectors to pay more

Anticipated for 2024, the technology, media, gaming, financial services, and retail sectors are poised for the most substantial salary increases at approximately 10 per cent. Several factors contribute to this projection:

High talent demand: These industries are experiencing rapid growth, and as a result, they require a skilled workforce. The heightened demand for talent is a key driver behind the salary uptick.

Competitive environment: Companies within these sectors are engaged in intense competition to both attract and retain top-tier talent, intensifying the upward pressure on salaries.

Emphasis on innovation: These sectors heavily rely on innovation to remain competitive. To stay ahead in the innovation race, companies in these fields often invest in their employees, which often translates into higher salaries.

Additionally, the marginally higher salary increases projected by companies in the BFSI, retail, and captives sectors for 2024 signify positive prospects. This indicates confidence in their future growth and underscores their commitment to investing in their workforce.

‚ÄúCompanies across industries are still closely monitoring their cost structures,"" said Rajul Mathur, Consulting Leader - Work and Rewards, WTW India.

Explaining survey responses

The WTW Salary Budget Planning Report stands as an expansive and all-encompassing survey, comprising over 32,000 responses from companies spanning 150 countries. This scale imparts significant statistical validity to the survey results, allowing for broad, overarching conclusions regarding salary increase trends.

Notably, the substantial participation of 708 Indian companies in this survey holds significance. It signals a keen awareness among Indian companies regarding the vital nature of salary budget planning, underlining their dedication to offering competitive compensation packages to their workforce.

Furthermore, the survey‚Äôs revelation that Indian companies anticipate a 9.8 per cent salary increase in 2024, closely aligned with the 10 per cent increase observed in 2023, carries positive implications for Indian employees. This indicates that Indian firms are actively investing in their workforce, demonstrating their commitment to providing competitive salaries and financial well-being to their employees.

In 2024, India is anticipated to lead Asia Pacific (APAC) with the highest projected salary increases, standing at 9.8 per cent. Following closely are Vietnam at eight per cent, China at six per cent, the Philippines at 5.7 per cent, and Thailand at five per cent.

This development bodes well for Indian employees, reflecting a corporate commitment to employee appreciation and investment in talent. Simultaneously, it serves as a positive indicator for the Indian economy, underlining business confidence in future growth prospects.

Additionally, the revelation that nearly 28 per cent of surveyed companies plan to engage in recruitment within the next 12 months carries encouraging implications for Indian workers. It signals a forthcoming strong demand for talent, providing promising opportunities in the coming year.

The prominence of IT, engineering, and sales positions atop the list comes as no surprise. These sectors are characterized by rapid growth, perpetually driving the demand for highly skilled professionals.

It‚Äôs worth noting the heightened demand for technical skills trade roles, which signifies an increasing need for proficient tradespeople in areas such as plumbing, carpentry, and electrical work. Furthermore, the inclusion of finance, marketing, and HR positions in the mix augurs well for the broader economy. This indicates that businesses are actively investing in expansion and workforce growth.

Positive outlook in the job market

In summary, the job market outlook for the upcoming 12 months appears optimistic. Diverse sectors are displaying a robust appetite for talent, offering favourable prospects for job seekers in their quest for employment opportunities.

‚ÄúSectors like manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, media, gaming, and global captive centres are expanding and this is evident from their hiring plans and salary allocations for 2024,"" said Mathur, adding, ‚ÄúDespite a slowdown in IT recruitment, mid-sized companies, product and platform firms, and the GCCs of financial services companies are expected to continue to hire.""

In 2023, the voluntary attrition rate in India decreased to 14.6 per cent from 15.3 per cent in 2022, indicating an uptick in job satisfaction among Indian employees and a reduced inclination to leave their positions voluntarily.

This trend can be attributed to a couple of potential factors. Firstly, Indian companies may be intensifying their investments in employees, offering more avenues for growth and development. Such measures can boost employee contentment and consequently lower turnover rates. Secondly, India's briskly expanding economy might be generating a greater number of job opportunities, enhancing job security, and thereby mitigating attrition.

Although the voluntary attrition rate in India remains relatively high, there is still room for improvement. Companies in India should persist in their efforts to invest in their workforce and foster a positive work environment.

24,mint,"Indians splurge big on festive season sales, buoying economy",https://www.livemint.com/economy/indians-splurge-big-on-festive-season-sales-buoying-economy-11698802243129.html,01 Nov 2023,,"India‚Äôs festive season spending is booming as consumers splurge on cars, smartphones and TVs, buoying growth in one of the world‚Äôs fastest-expanding economies.

Sales at online platforms like Amazon.com Inc., and Walmart Inc.-owned Flipkart was up by almost a fifth in the first week of the festive sales from a year ago. Digital transactions recorded by Unified Payments Interface surged about 40 percent in October from a year earlier.

India‚Äôs festive season usually runs for several weeks until the Hindu religious holiday of Diwali ‚Äî which takes place on November 12 this year ‚Äî with millions of Indians often binging on food, gifts and home improvements. The sales are a key indicator of the health of consumption, which makes up about 60 percent of India‚Äôs gross domestic product.

Economists point to an easing in inflation and a pickup in wages, especially in the rural countryside, where a majority of India‚Äôs population live. Consumer confidence reached a four-year high in September, the latest central bank figures show, while demand for bank loans is hovering near a 12-year high despite interest rate hikes this year.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government is also targeting farmers ahead of elections, giving them higher guaranteed prices on some crops and curbing cooking gas costs.

‚ÄúBoth urban and rural consumption are entering the festive season on a much stronger footing,"" Yuvika Singhal and Vivek Kumar, economists at Quanteco Research, wrote in a report last week. The continuing fiscal support directed toward rural areas ahead of polls could further boost consumption in the sector, they said.

Stronger spending is helping to drive manufacturing activity in Asia‚Äôs third-largest economy and underpinning growth of more than 6 percent in the current fiscal year that ends in March. The International Monetary Fund predicts India‚Äôs economy will grow 6.3 percent in both 2023 and 2024 ‚Äî the fastest pace among major economies.

Consumer businesses are reporting stronger sales, while banks like Axis Bank Ltd. are betting on a pickup in business momentum in the next few months. Reliance Retail said in a statement last week that it saw ‚Äústrong shopping"" during recent festivals.

On top of the festive period, consumption will likely also get a boost from the Cricket World Cup and the upcoming wedding season.

The cricket tournament is being hosted in cities across India until November 19, with some economists estimating it could add $2.6 billion to the economy as fans spend on travel and eating out. The Confederation of All India Traders, the country‚Äôs largest traders group, expects the wedding season, which runs from November 23 to December 15, will result in $50 billion of spending on items like gold jewelry, clothing and other consumer goods.

‚ÄúThe festive season is expected to be followed by a robust wedding period, both of which combined should support near-term growth,"" Teresa John, an economist at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities Pvt, said last week. ‚ÄúEasy availability of credit and expectations of cooling inflation should also aid a gradual recovery in discretionary spending particularly in the mass market.""

Online sales from Amazon, Flipkart and others reached 47 billion rupees ($565 million) in the week through October 15, consulting firm RedSeer said in a report. Mobile phones, electronic goods and large appliances drove around 67 percent of the sales, it said.

UPI, which records real-time digital payments, processed transactions worth 16.46 trillion rupees from October 1-30, an increase of more than 40 percent from a year earlier. Credit card payments jumped 16 percent to 1.42 trillion rupees in September, data from the Reserve Bank of India shows.

Other high frequency indicators paint a similar picture of strong consumption:

Goods and services tax collection rose 10 percent from a year earlier to 1.6 trillion rupees in September

Peak electricity demand, a key barometer for activity in industrial and manufacturing sectors, surged to an all-time high of 240 gigawatts in September, topping the government‚Äôs forecasts

Factory floors are also buzzing, with manufacturers adding more capacity to keep up with the strong demand.

‚ÄúWe have healthy orders across most of the verticals led by mobile phones, LED televisions and washing machines,"" Saurabh Gupta, chief financial officer at Dixon Technologies Ltd., one of the country‚Äôs largest contract manufacturers, said earlier this month. Dixon had introduced multiple shifts across the majority of its 20 factories to meet its order pipeline.

In an interview with Mint, Nandi shares his views on the inflation trajectory and how an economic slowdown in the US can impact us. Edited excerpts:

What is your view on the Indian economy?

The latest GDP data for Q2 2023 saw private consumption and fixed investment drive stellar growth of 7.8 per cent year-on-year (YoY) from 6.1 per cent in Q1.

High-frequency indicators suggest that this momentum seems to have persisted into Q3, although there seems to be some softening in data in September compared to the performance in August.

Consumption continues to recover, although it is still K-shaped (for instance, there is stronger demand for SUVs than smaller cars and two-wheelers).

We are also witnessing slower demand for discretionary goods, although news reports suggest that festive sales in October look promising.

Investment indicators so far speak of robust performance but seem primarily driven by the public sector.

Both, merchandise export and import growth contracted in September compared to relatively stronger growth rates in August, along with moderation in services exports.

The monsoon season has concluded with cumulative rainfall a shade ‚Äòbelow normal‚Äô but the skewed distribution could impact agri output this year.

We remain cautious of headwinds to domestic demand from weaker rural demand, a likely slowdown in government capex as the election cycle heats up and spillovers from sluggish global growth.

We maintain our GDP growth forecast at 6.3 per cent YoY in 2023 and 5.5 per cent in 2024 (FY24: 5.9 per cent; FY25: 5.6 per cent).

Prodigal inflation has returned home to RBI‚Äôs comfort zone of below 6 per cent, with the September reading sliding to 5 per cent YoY in September from 6.8 per cent in August, far below market expectations of 5.4 per cent.

This was owing to a strong deflation in vegetable prices, lower fuel inflation (LPG cylinder price cuts), and a sharper dip in core inflation to 4.5 per cent from 4.8 per cent.

However, broader food inflationary pressures are still a worry ‚Äì especially rising price pressures for pulses, rice, wheat, sugar and spices, which face upside risks from poor monsoons.

Second-round effects have, however, so far been muted and the government is proactively undertaking supply-side measures.

We expect inflation to average 5.7 per cent YoY in 2023 and 4.4 per cent for 2024 (FY24: 5.4 per cent, FY25: 4.5 per cent).

How can a slowdown in the US impact us?

A slowdown in the US at a time when Europe is already facing growth headwinds and China is struggling means that there is a risk of a more protracted slowdown globally.

For India, the key vulnerability is on the export side, with the US being a key market not just for India‚Äôs merchandise exports, but also for its services exports.

It is rather telling that IT companies have recently sounded cautious on global macro headwinds and are reassessing their headcount needs, highlighting how a hit to exports could end up having ripple effects impacting employment and in turn consumption demand.

In the past, we have also seen India‚Äôs capex cycle struggle when global conditions worsen.

The key question for markets is whether the US is looking at a ‚Äòsoft landing‚Äô, a ‚Äòhard landing‚Äô or a ‚Äòcrash landing‚Äô.

The resilience in concurrent macro data makes it difficult to say for sure which scenario will emerge.

Also Read: Indian equities will deliver double-digit returns in the next 2-3 years, says Pranav Haridasan of Axis Securities

What are your views on the Chinese economy? How can it impact us in a positive or negative way?

After hitting a historical high in the second half of 2020 (H2 2020) and the first half of 2021 (H1 2021), China‚Äôs property sector experienced an unprecedented correction.

With the confidence of households and investors damaged, the property sector is still seeking a real bottom.

High-frequency data in October still show little signs of a real revival ‚Äì while the contraction in new home sales has narrowed on improving transactions in big cities, low-tier cities still remain in deep contractionary territory.

Domestic excavator sales also remain deeply negative, pointing to depressed demand for capital durable goods. Geopolitical tensions have also worsened with the US tightening curbs on AI chip exports to China.

Our baseline view is that China is poised to experience a slowdown towards year-end or in early 2024 and we maintain our below-consensus 3.9 per cent forecast of 2024 annual GDP growth.

India‚Äôs exports to China as a share of total exports are much lesser compared to other Asian economies, so the negative impact will most likely be more measured.

Meanwhile, the shift in supply chains away from China is beneficial to India, although a lot will depend on India‚Äôs steadfast focus on reforms, infrastructure upgrades, upskilling of the workforce, and attracting foreign investment.

Also Read: Israel-Hamas conflict smaller in scale; uptrend in mid, smallcaps may resume, says Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities

How do you expect the inflation trajectory from here on? Can crude oil prices deal a blow to RBI's efforts? When do you expect a cut in interest rates?

We expect headline inflation to remain around 5 per cent through FY24 and core inflation in the 4-4.5 per cent range. That said, upside risks remain.

Weak monsoons continue to pose a risk to food production and prices, with lower acreage (on a YoY basis) for pulses, cotton and oilseeds among kharif crops and lesser rain impacting water reservoir levels, and potentially lowering the yield of the coming wheat crop.

On a YoY basis, inflation for items like cereals, pulses, milk, and spices is already trending at multi-year highs.

On fuel, we expect oil marketing companies to keep petrol/diesel prices unchanged, ahead of coming state elections in Q4. For core, lagged effects of monetary policy tightening and base effects should moderate YoY core inflation further, in our view.

As such weÔªø see downside risk to our baseline FY24 inflation projection of 5.4 per cent, which is in line with the RBI‚Äôs forecast and expect inflation at 4.5 per cent in FY25.

The US bond yields have seen strong gains lately. What is boosting US Treasury yields?

It is challenging to attribute a single reason as to why the yields have picked up so rapidly.

It is probably a combination of a number of factors ‚Äì greater market confidence in the US growth resilience, continued inflationary pressures, hardening of expectations that the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer, and increasing worries on higher fiscal deficit in the US.

Additionally, the improvement in the balance sheet strength of corporate India and the much-improved health of the Indian banking system is another positive which will help Indian equities to deliver double-digit returns in the next two to three years led by double-digit earnings growth. In an interview with Mint, Haridasan shares his views on markets and the economy. Edited excerpts:

What is your view on the Q2 earnings of India Inc. so far? What are your expectations on earnings upgrades/downgrades?

Q2FY24 earning season till now is in line with our expectations. As anticipated, large-cap IT services companies posted a muted Q2FY24 primarily due to challenging times from the world's largest economies.

The December quarter for IT companies is also considered a seasonally weak quarter because of the holidays.

We can expect some recovery in Q4FY24 and a ramp-up of the deals they won in the previous quarters.

FMCG demand remains stable during Q2FY24, with urban demand continuing to lead and the rural markets remaining muted during the quarter.

However, gradual recovery is likely in the sector in the upcoming quarter, especially in the rural areas, led by:

(a) Government capital expenditure leading to job creation.

(b) The festive season in Q3.

(c) Increase in urban remittances.

(d) Moderation in the inflation.

Additionally, premium categories continue to grow faster than the mass segment.

Financial heavyweights delivered robust numbers with a stable asset quality trend, while some margin pressure was visible during the quarter.

We expect Nifty FY24 and FY25 earnings at 928 and 1,048, respectively, with growth expectations of 17 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively, as we are still in the early earnings season. So far, there have been no substantial deviations from our initial expectations.

We will review our estimates following the conclusion of the earnings season.

What is your short-term view of the market? Should we keep our expectations low?

Short-term headwinds driven by the US 10-year yield rising above 5 per cent, geopolitical tensions, and crude breakout on the upside will keep us a bit cautious and time our entry points better.

Furthermore, we are entering a few primary state elections in the upcoming months and the general election next year, so volatility will likely increase from the current levels in the next 12 months.

Nonetheless, the Indian economy remains in the sweet spot of growth, which would stay the biggest driver of Indian equities moving forward.

The improvement in the balance sheet strength of corporate India and the much-improved health of the Indian banking system is another positive attribute and a significant one as it will ensure that Indian equities will easily manage to deliver double-digit returns in the next two to three years led by double-digit earnings growth.

Based on the current scenario, we recommend investors maintain good liquidity (10-20 per cent) to use any dips in a phased manner and build a position in high-quality companies (where the earnings visibility is relatively high) with an investment horizon of 12-18 months.

What should our strategy be for the mid and small-cap space now?

Over the past year, the broader market has significantly outperformed the benchmark index. We observed a substantial catch-up in the mid/small-cap index from the March 2023 low.

The market has since recovered considerably, with 86 per cent of the stocks (till September 2023-end) trading above the 200-day moving average, indicating that the market is near the overbought zone. From here, the market will likely see a style and sector rotation.

With the significant catch-up by midcaps and small-caps in the last couple of months, we believe that the margin of safety at current levels has reduced in some pockets compared to large caps.

With this view, the broader market may see some time correction in the near term, while flows will likely shift to large caps. However, the long-term story of the overall market continues to remain attractive.

On top of it, 'growth at a reasonable price' looks attractive at the current juncture because of domestic play cool-off in commodity prices and inflation, and the expectation of rural recovery in the upcoming quarters.

Do you think the US Fed may hike rates from here on? When do you expect the Fed to start cutting interest rates?

The recent US 10-year bond yield surge indicates that we may see one potential rate hike in the upcoming FOMC meeting.

The current GDP prints from the US have all pointed to a pretty robust economy, and hence, the US 10-year bond yields could remain elevated for extended periods than some parts of the market have been expecting.

The second half of 2024 (H2CY24) is perhaps when we could start to see a softer bond view, but stubborn inflation and growth prints at the moment keep expectations muted.

How could a US economic slowdown impact the Indian market?

With the US economy nearing the peak of its rate hike cycle, we can expect one rate hike in the US market before the US Fed pauses.

In the recent past, the market has not seen such interest rate hikes, which inherently elevates the risk of missteps.

This action would translate into a slowdown or heightened recession in the developed market, which will impact the export-oriented growth in the domestic market.

It will consequently pose challenges to some parts of earnings and market multiple of the domestic market.

Nonetheless, the Indian economy stands at a sweet spot of growth and remains the land of stability against the backdrop of a volatile global economy. This development would remain the biggest driver of Indian equities moving forward.

The improvement in the balance sheet strength of corporate India and the much-improved health of the Indian banking system are other significant positive attributes as they will ensure that Indian equities will easily manage to deliver double-digit returns in the next two to three years.

Why are foreign investors selling Indian equities despite a robust economic growth outlook? For how long will it continue?

We have seen selling by FIIs in the domestic market in the last few weeks, led by a sudden surge in the US bond yields and the rise in the dollar index. However, this trend is more tactical, as any cool-off in bond yields and dollar index is a positive signal for emerging market flows.

We think India will continue to attract a significant amount of foreign portfolio investor interest, given the potential of our domestic market, and as we continue to see considerable rotation out of China from a structural economic perspective. Yes, the recent selling is more short-term, and we expect the flows to stabilise.

What sectors are you positive about for the next one to two years?

All major economy-linked sectors will drive the next leg of the rally in the domestic market.

Four themes that will continue to grab attention are financialisation and digitisation, import substitution, premiumisation, and manufacturing.

The key sectors that will be beneficiaries are BFSI, building materials, industrials and capital goods, hospitals, and automobiles.

29,mint,World Cup 2023: Certainly not a child's play; economic benefits aplenty,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/as-india-hosts-cricket-world-cup-2023-these-sectors-to-get-a-leg-up-11698640012662.html,30 Oct 2023,,"India, home to 1.4 billion people, is currently hosting the 13th edition of the Cricket World Cup after a gap of a dozen years. It was in this very nation, during the last hosting of the event, that the Indian cricket team, under the captaincy of M.S. Dhoni clinched the World Cup after a 28-year-long wait. The victory was sealed in a thrilling moment, with Captain Dhoni's unforgettable six, forever etched in the annals of cricket history.

Turning the page to the previous World Cup in 2019, held in England, the Indian cricket team faced a defeat against New Zealand in a thrilling Semi-Final Match. Now, as we fast forward to the much-anticipated 2023 edition, the men in blue exude confidence in their pursuit of a third World Cup title.

The World Cup event that kicked off on Oct 5 spans a full 46 days, featuring a total of 48 matches (40% of matches have already been completed) that are spread across ten major cities in India. These host cities include Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Dharamsala, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Pune, and three more in Hyderabad. Beyond the joy and excitement the World Cup brings, this colossal event is expected to usher in substantial economic benefits for India.

Dilip Cherian, image guru, says that the most important impact of the World Cup cricket being held in India is, of course, on the broad image parameters on which India is compared with other venues.

‚ÄúAs the host country, extra attention gets focussed, of course, on our aviation, hospitality, and retail sectors. How efficient they are under pressure and how our price/quality ratios compared with products in other parts of the world is, of course, what will matter eventually,"" he says.

World Cup impact on consumption across categories

According to a report by Airbnb, searches for stays in India have gone up dramatically in recent months, with Ahmedabad at the forefront of this cricketing fervour. Accommodation searches in Ahmedabad had witnessed a 4,000 percent spike, largely driven by the anticipation of the India-Pakistan match.

The aviation industry is also seeing an increase in bookings, as fans travel between host cities to catch the matches. IndiGo, a leading player in the Indian aviation sector, has reported a 20% increase in bookings for the months of October and November, compared to the same period last year.

Meanwhile, broadcasters and advertisers are spending heavily in anticipation of the Cricket World Cup 2023. Star Sports, the official broadcaster of the tournament in India, has reportedly sold over 90% of its advertising inventory for the tournament.

Sam Balsara, chairman of Madison World, says, ‚ÄúIn any country a major sporting event always provides a boost, whether it is Olympics or Football and it is no different for cricket which is considered a religion in India. The number of groups, old students groups, office colleagues, families who have planned group visits to outstation to enjoy a match in a stadium is huge. No doubt Cricket is big business in India. The impact on Ad spends, travel, hospitality, sporting gear, sporting attire, event and promotion agencies is huge and palpable.""

The sale of cricket-related merchandise is also picking up, with fans buying everything from jerseys and caps to bats and balls. According to a report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the sale of cricket-related merchandise is expected to increase by 30% during the Cricket World Cup 2023.

Let‚Äôs look at the individual sectors that are poised to thrive during this world cup

Travel and hospitality: The tournament is expected to attract millions of visitors from both India and abroad, which will boost the travel and hospitality industries. According to a report by Kotak Securities, the Cricket World Cup 2023 could add up to ‚Çπ13,500 crore to the Indian economy, with a significant portion of this coming from the travel and hospitality sectors.

Media and entertainment: The Cricket World Cup is one of the most popular sporting events in the world, and it is expected to generate significant viewership in India. This will boost the media and entertainment industry, as broadcasters and advertisers spend heavily to reach the large audience. Kotak Securities estimates that the media and entertainment industry could generate up to ‚Çπ4,500 crore from the Cricket World Cup 2023.

Retail: The Cricket World Cup is also expected to boost retail sales, as fans purchase memorabilia, clothing, and other items related to the tournament. According to a report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the Cricket World Cup 2023 could boost retail sales by up to ‚Çπ2,500 crore.



Food and beverage: The Cricket World Cup is also expected to boost sales of food and beverages, as fans eat and drink while watching the matches. Kotak Securities estimates that the food and beverage industry could generate up to ‚Çπ1,500 crore from the Cricket World Cup 2023.

The billionaire tech founder made similar comments in an interview with a news channel three years ago, when he suggested that youngsters should put in 60 hours per week for the next two to three years in order to revive the Indian economy.

In an interview with ET Now in 2020, Murthy said, ‚Äò‚ÄôIndians would have to learn to live with coronavirus for the next 12-18 months, companies will need to take precautions, and overall, Indians would have to put in more work and more hours to put the economy on a track again.''

Notably, the comments by the tech leader then came at a time when the first wave of COVID-19 had gripped the country into an economic slowdown. Murthy explained that to pull the Indian economy out of the slump that had resulted from the COVID-19 lockdown, Indians should vow to work longer and harder.

‚ÄúWe should take a pledge that we will work ten hours a day, six days a week - as against 40 hours a week - for the next 2-3 years so that we can fast-track and grow the economy much faster. On the side of the government, they should appoint a committee of well-respected and accomplished people to advise them on how to remove hassles for these businesses, like during the economic reforms of 1991. If we did these two, by and large, we will come out of this much stronger,"" Murthy said in 2020.

Three years down the line, the Infosys founder has now added 10 extra hours to the weekly work log target as advice for young Indians, noting that India's work productivity was one of the lowest in the world.

The remarks came during an episode of the first episode of 3one4 Capital‚Äôs podcast ‚ÄòThe Record‚Äô that was aired earlier this week, where Murthy spoke about nation-building, technology, his company Infosys, and several other topics ‚Äì including his opinion on today‚Äôs youth.

""Somehow our youth has the habit of taking not-so-desirable habits from the West, and then‚Ä¶ not helping the country‚Ä¶Unless we improve our work productivity, unless we reduce corruption in the government at some level, because we have been reading I don't know the truth of it, unless we reduce the delays in our bureaucracy in taking this decision, we will not be able to compete with those countries that have made tremendous progress. Therefore, my request is that our youngsters must say, this is my country, I‚Äôd like to work 70 hours a week,"" said Narayana Murthy in a conversation with former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai.

Murthy added that in order to compete with countries like China, India‚Äôs youngsters must put in extra hours of work ‚Äì as Japan and Germany did after World War 2.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Transformation has to come to youngsters because youngsters form a significant majority of our population at this point in time, and they are the ones who can build our country,"" Narayana Murthy said concluding his point.

Also Read: India Inc divided as Narayana Murthy calls for 70 hour work week; Bhavish Aggarwal, Ronnie Screwvala weigh in

Murthy's remarks on India's low work productivity and suggestions over the 70-hour work week sparked a buzz on social media, inviting polarised views from India Inc. On one hand, Ola Cabs co-founder Bhavish Aggarwal seconded Narayana Murthy's viewpoint and said 'It's our moment to go all in and build in one generation what other countries built over many generations.'

Whereas some business leaders and entrepreneurs opposed the idea and asserted that it is more about getting better at what one does as the quality of work is more valuable than putting in more hours.

upGrad founder Ronnie Screwvala said, ‚ÄúBoosting productivity isn't just about working longer hours. It's about getting better at what you do - Upskilling, having a positive work environment, and fair pay for the work done. Quality of work done > clocking in more hours.''

32,mint,"India will manage 8% growth by 2030 if more women join workforce, says report",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-will-manage-8-pc-gdp-growth-by-2030-if-more-women-join-workforce-says-report-11698328560823.html,26 Oct 2023,,"The road to India's 8% GDP growth passes through the precondition of increasing the female workforce and by improving labour productivity, says a recent Barclays report.

The report titled, ‚ÄúIndia's breakout moment"", says that India can achieve a GDP growth rate of 8% by ensuring that women account for more than half of the new workforce set to be created by 2030. The report also highlighted on the need to improve labour productivity through upskilling to fully utilise its young generation.

Current female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) stands at 37%. However, to ensure incremental growth in the Indian workforce, India needs to increase its FLFPR to 43.4% by 2030.

‚ÄúThis means that of the roughly 108 million estimated increase in the labour force, around 55 million (~50%) would have to come from women, which implies only a partial convergence of male-to-female jobs ratio ‚Äì that is, for every female worker, there would be 1.9 male workers in 2030, versus 2.2 currently,"" stated the report.

Growth of non-agricultural jobs

Other than the significance of bringing more women into the workforce, the report underlined the importance of faster growth of non-agricultural jobs to employ surplus labour. It also mentioned the need to bring more formalisation of employment.

Sectors like construction, wholesale, retail trade segments, manufacturing, etc have the potential to generate opportunities for the expanding workforce in the coming years. Sectors like real estate, professional, and financial services, will also provide employment opportunities in the coming years.

Employment generation and labour productivity

Apart from employment generation, a focus on education and skills training in emerging technologies and capital-intensive sectors is required to improve labour productivity and help generate more formal-sector jobs. The report indicated that India's labour market can increase its share of GDP contribution not ‚Äújust through a shift away from agriculture, but also through raising labour productivity.""

It also suggested that investment in hard infrastructure/traditional industries would significantly improve labour productivity and will also raise the efficiency of both factors of production, capital, and labour. The report also suggested that sectors such as chemicals, transport equipment, metals, telecom, and business services, can generate more jobs and improve labour's share in income.

Looking at the focus on large science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in the Indian education system, the report also pointed towards the scope to increase employability in the IT sector and technical jobs as ‚ÄúIndia seeks to build capabilities in the manufacture of semiconductors, hydrocarbons, EV batteries, defence, and climate technology, among other industries.""

Germany and Japan is post Second World War period

The Infosys founder also cited post-World War II Germany and Japan as an example, noting how people in Germany worked extra hours for a certain number of years.

‚ÄúSo, I hope our corporate leaders will be able to address our youngsters and say, ‚ÄòFor the first time India has received certain respect. This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress and to do that we need to work very hard, we need to be disciplined and improve our work productivity,"" Narayana Murthy added.

The equity market has cracked ‚Äì the Sensex lost more than 850 points on Thursday and is down to its lowest level in four months ‚Äì as investors are nervous about how India would be affected by an escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said preparations are being made for ‚Äúa ground invasion"" of the Gaza Strip. The fear is that this could lead to contagion, with Iran becoming more directly involved on behalf of Hamas and widening the arena of conflict. That in turn may cause Arab nations, which are major oil and gas producers, to use their ‚Äúenergy leverage"", as they have in previous conflicts. In 1973, for example, Opec hiked crude and gas prices to punish Western nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War.

The biggest worry is thus around the availability and prices of crude oil If the situation in Gaza is not resolved quickly. Iran is already under sanctions that reduce its ability to export oil and gas, and so is Russia thanks to the Ukraine war.

India is especially vulnerable as it imports roughly 85% of its crude and over 50% of its gas. While estimates at the time of the 2023-24 budget assumed that the Indian crude basket would average around $75 a barrel, the conflict has already pushed this over $90. There will inevitably be pressure on the rupee if energy prices lead to a bigger import bill. That would mean higher inflation across the economy, which would force the Reserve Bank of India to keep interest rates higher for longer.

Under normal circumstances the buffer for higher crude import bills are export earnings (including services exports) and higher hard-currency investments into India in the form of both FDI and portfolio investments. However, the global economy is weak at the moment, suffering from a combination of low growth and high inflation. This reduces investments into India and opportunities for exporters. The IT industry, for example, has seen poor growth and issued cautious advisories in the past two quarters.

High global inflation also means hawkish central banks. Currency pressures harm exporters‚Äô prospects and also cause caution among portfolio investors. With rising uncertainty, global central banks are warning that interest rates could remain higher for longer, keeping the cost of capital high. This is causing dollar investors to pull their money out of emerging markets and seek refuge in US treasuries. The Indian equity markets haven‚Äôt been immune to this selloff.

Apart from this, investors will likely remain cautious until the upcoming Lok Sabha elections are completed and the next government is sworn in, and will closely track the outcomes of the state assembly elections due next month for cues. Political stability is among the most important factors for foreign investors looking to invest in emerging markets. Gaza has just added another layer of worries to the volatility caused by India‚Äôs electoral cycle."

THE ECOSYSTEM FOR PROGRESS

Slush‚Äôs vision extends beyond celebrating entrepreneurship.

Additionally, NASSCOM‚Äôs Deep Tech Club (DTC) 2.0 is aimed at scaling the impact to over 1,000 firms that are leveraging technologies such as AI, ML, Internet of Things, robotics and blockchain.

THE SLUSH LEGACY

This journey began in 2008 in Helsinki, with an initial gathering of approximately 250 attendees for a one-day event. Despite the remarkable growth in size over the years, the core objective has remained constant: to concentrate on the most effective ways to support and enhance startup ecosystems worldwide. Slush operates as a force for startups and stands for something larger than entrepreneurship. The central idea has always been to imagine a better world and take responsibility to act through inclusive efforts. Through its global network, Slush reaches out to diverse talent and networks to achieve more together. The organisers believe that innovation can overcome the barriers to progress.

The pillars of Slush now and in the future are centred around the concept of ‚ÄòEntrepreneurship Redefined‚Äô. At its core, it aims to connect founders with what and whom they need while building a new, inclusive and more purposeful culture of entrepreneurship.

This is because Slush fully believes that its actions as a society over the next decade will determine the course of humanity for generations to come. Entrepreneurs building scalable solutions will be at the core of creating the solutions that will make that future a bright one.

41,mint,How can the Israel-Hamas war impact Indian economy? ‚Äî Explained,https://www.livemint.com/economy/israelhamas-war-impact-crude-oil-deficit-to-wider-cad-how-the-middle-east-conflict-can-hit-the-indian-economy-11698081267465.html,24 Oct 2023,,"The current geopolitical conflict in the Middle East due to the ongoing war between Israel and Palestinian terrorist group Hamas has brought fresh global headwinds for the Indian economy. Ever since the war broke out earlier this month, international crude oil prices have risen over 5 per cent and US bond yields have breached the 5 per cent-mark to hit 16-year high levels.

The economic impact of global oil supply have important implications for India ‚Äì a net importer of crude oil ‚Äì to deliver price stability. Analysts say that India continues to see macroeconomic stability at this moment, but is vulnerable to one key risk - supply disruption in crude oil prices because of escalation in the war, resulting in a spike in crude oil prices.

International crude oil prices may rise significantly if Iran - which is a major supporter of Hamas, joins the war. If that happens, it may lead to selling pressure in the market. To explore the domestic implications better, let's first understand how the Israel-Hamas war can impact the global economy:

Also Read: From high inflation to import bill - the domino effect of rising crude oil prices on Indian economy

How can the Israel-Hamas war impact the global economy?

With major oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia announcing oil supply cuts of a combined 1.3 million barrels per day (mbpd) till the end of the year, the global economy already faces an oil market deficit.

Now, with oil prices hovering above the $90 per barrel-mark, the escalation of the conflict towards other Middle Eastern oil producers is concerning and requires careful monitoring, especially given the global economy's 'higher for longer' interest rate scenario.

The oil supply is unlikely to be threatened unless the issue expands to other nations in the region and becomes a proxy conflict between the US and Iran.

‚Äò‚ÄôBrent had crossed the $90 mark but then retreated. Now, we can use the $90 number to be the threshold beyond which there is trouble for the world economy,'' said Shantanu Bhargava, Managing Director, Head of Discretionary Investment Services, Waterfield Advisors.

When oil prices rise, the cost of production for various industries and energy costs for businesses and households also surge, driving global inflation higher. High energy prices and new inflationary trends could undermine the efforts of central banks to bring inflation under control.

With this, central banks across the globe will continue hiking interest rates, which will slow down the global economic growth.

The global economy faces high inflation again as crude oil prices rise. If oil prices stay high, the US, India, China, and other major nations that import oil may see substantial import inflation. Let's take a look at how the war can impact the Indian economy:

How can the Israel-Hamas war impact the Indian economy?



High import bill, wider current account deficit:

India - a net importer of crude oil which fulfills as much as 85 per cent of its energy needs through imports, may see a heavier import bill if international crude oil prices keep rising throughout the year. It can result in a trade deficit, as India has to spend more on oil imports, which can, in turn, put pressure on the country's current account balance.

‚Äò‚ÄôHigh crude oil prices hurt India impacting currency stability, possibly worsening the government‚Äôs fiscal deficit (the government is likely to absorb higher prices by cutting excise duty), widening the current account deficit (CAD) further impacting currency adversely and affecting the profit margins of sectors such as aviation, paints, tyres and chemicals,'' said Waterfields' Shantanu Bhargava.

CAD is a key indicator of the balance of payment of a country and in the current scenario of the momentum picked up by crude rates, every $10 dollar rise in Brent futures potentially widens the CAD by 0.5 per cent, according to market experts.

‚Äò‚ÄôEvery 10 dollar rise in Brent crude prices widens India‚Äôs current account deficit by 0.5 per cent. Consequently this depreciates the INR and leads to imported inflation,'' said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.



Weaker Indian Rupee

High oil prices pushes the US dollar above against its peers, which in turn, is a downside for the Indian rupee. Since India pays for oil imports in dollars, a higher oil import bill can lead to an increase in demand for dollars, potentially weakening the rupee against the dollar.



Refining Margins of OMCs:

If the crude oil price continues to rise, it could have a significant impact on some specific stocks and the broader economy. The Indian crude oil basket has averaged ~ $80.1 per barrel in the first five months of FY24. But the price of the Indian crude basket touched $90.7 per barrel in the first week of September.

If Brent crude prices remain elevated for the remainder of the fiscal year, we anticipate that the full-year average price for Indian crude oil basket could be ~$86-87 per barrel, according to estimates given by brokerages.

High international oil prices will raise the average Indian crude basket price and the oil marketing companies (OMCs) including Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), will register losses in gross refinery margins.

‚Äò‚ÄôAs we approach the pre-election period, we anticipate that OMCs will absorb a significant portion of the elevated global crude prices. The government may also consider partially sharing this burden with OMCs by reducing certain duties and taxes on retail fuel prices,'' said CareEdge Ratings.

Inflation:

An increase in international oil prices may lead to higher fuel prices, which can trigger inflationary pressures. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the sustained increase in prices is expected to lead to a lower aggregate demand as households and firms are left with less disposable incomes to spend on non-energy goods. This is how domestic consumer prices respond to an oil supply news shock.

Surprise changes in oil prices can also influence the price and wage-setting in the economy by altering the inflation expectations of firms and households, and so, domestic economic activity falls on impact of such a shock.



High fiscal deficit:

The government often subsidizes fuel prices to protect consumers from the full impact of rising oil prices. ‚Äò‚ÄôIf the crude oil prices remain at their elevated level for longer, the government may need to increase subsidies or absorb a portion of the price increase, leading to a higher fiscal deficit'', according to ICICI Securities.

In simple words, the government bears the difference between the market price and the controlled price of oil and gas end-products such as kerosene, diesel, liquified petroleum gas (LPG). This is likely to widen the fiscal deficit - expressed as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).

However, the report was positive about India's FY24 macroeconomic prospects, backed by robust domestic fundamentals, rising private consumption, and investment demand.

Oil prices slipped on Monday as investors continued to focus on the situation in the Middle East, where diplomatic efforts are intensifying in an attempt to contain the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Brent crude futures fell 24 cents to $91.92 a barrel, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 36 cents at $87.72 a barrel.

Just a year ago, crude oil was hovering at around $85 a barrel.

""There are imminent fears of rising crude oil prices in H2 FY24, given that the average price during Q2FY24 ($86.8/bbl.) was higher than Q1FY24 ($77.9/bbl.) and ongoing speculation and wait-and-watch situation emerging from the recent geopolitical situation in the middle-East,"" the Economic Review said.

Meanwhile, interest rates in the US are expected to stay higher for a longer period to get inflation back to the US central bank's 2% target.

Higher US interest rates adversely affect emerging market economies as it increases cost of borrowing and dampens demand.

Although core inflation in India has shown a consistent drop, the review, released by the finance ministry‚Äôs department of economic affairs, underlined challenges like fluctuating oil prices and muted global demand.

However, despite the challenges, India will remain the fastest-growing major economy in the world during FY24, said the economic review.

""Sluggish global demand is affecting India's trade, but this is projected to recover from H2FY24,"" it said. ‚ÄúNonetheless, with a lower trade deficit and a comfortable forex reserve position, India's external account looks robust.""

To be sure, the Indian economy received a boost as retail inflation cooled in September, retreating within the central bank‚Äôs comfort zone.

Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation eased for the second consecutive month in September to 5.02%, aided by a slower rise in vegetable prices.

Separately, latest data from the statistics ministry showed factory output grew 10.3% in August, though in part, influenced by a statistical effect.

Cooling inflation and a pick-up in factory output, especially in capital goods, regarded as a proxy for investments, is welcome news for policymakers and companies grappling with high borrowing costs and a slump in export markets.

Going forward, the Economic Review expects better growth prospects due to improving trade prospects in 2024.

""India's lower vulnerability in external debt indicators, compared with its emerging market economy peers, lends further strength to a robust external sector,"" the economic review said.

Meanwhile, the economic review said Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) remained invested in the Indian economy, which provided resilience to India's external sector.

""In H1 FY24, net foreign portfolio investment inflows were US$ 16.5 billion as against net outflows of US$ 7.8 billion in H1 FY23. This along with consistent surpluses on account of remittances (though moderating by 8% Q-o-Q in Q1FY24) and services exports provide resilience to India's external sector,"" the Economic Review said.

""Further, India's foreign exchange reserves have been consistently cushioning the external financing needs and were at US$ 584.7 billion as of 6 October 2023,"" it added.

""India remains standout overweight. We increase our overweight stance on Indian equities and as our most-preferred emerging market,"" PTI quoted a brokerage note as saying on Friday.

Apart from this, Morgan Stanley said that the 'dream' run of domestic flows continues and multipolar world dynamics are driving both FDI as well as portfolio flows towards the country, adding, that the domestic equities top the brokerage's global equity investment score with an overall score of 68.

Singapore though is at the second highest score is a distant 54, Greece at 47, Mexico at 43, and Poland at 38, making the top five markets for the company this year.

From early 2021 until October 2022, India has been structurally outperforming the MSCI EM index by 45.5 percent (in USD terms.

It said, ""We expect outperformance to continue, with India starting to show a material breakout in relative EPS versus EM and having relatively low correlation/revenue from both the US and China.""

The brokerage said that the recent high-frequency trends also support our bullish stance with inflation concerns abating and the trade balance improving. It added that other than India only Japan has an overweight stance in Asia.

""We remain structurally bullish on India with the key thesis of our market upgrade intact. Our India economics team's recent tracker shows projects under implementation have recorded broad-based growth and PMI manufacturing remains in the expansionary zone since July 2021, likely driven by strong domestic demand amid a broad external weakness,"" the report said.

After September CPI moderated to 5 percent and core CPI slowed further to 4.6 percent, the previous concerns of higher inflation causing abrupt changes in monetary policies have somewhat abated. The trade deficit has also narrowed with the service trade balance improving sequentially in September.

From an average return in dollar terms India has been historically outperformed on average during EM bear markets, to the tune of almost 8 percent each year since 1997, the report said.

The rate-setting panel highlighted that headwinds from global factors such as geopolitical tensions, volatile financial markets and energy prices, and climate shocks pose downside risks to the growth outlook.

The country's domestic demand conditions are expected to benefit from the sustained buoyancy in services, revival in rural demand, consumer and business optimism, the government‚Äôs thrust on capex, and healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, according to the central bank.

‚Äò‚ÄôTaking all these factors into consideration, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent, with Q2 at 6.5 per cent, Q3 at 6.0 per cent, and Q4 at 5.7 per cent, with risks evenly balanced. Real GDP growth for Q1:2024-25 is projected at 6.6 per cent,'' said the MPC in its minutes.

Here are the top five highlights of the RBI's October MPC Minutes:



1.Inflation ruling above tolerance band, policy to remain disinflationary: India's headline inflation is ruling above the tolerance band and its alignment with the target is getting interrupted. Hence, the central bank's monetary policy needs to remain actively disinflationary, according to the MPC minutes.

‚Äò‚ÄôIf we tame inflation durably, we will prepare the ground for a long innings of strong and stable growth‚Ä¶Monetary policy can contribute by remaining sufficiently disinflationary without being overly restraining,'' said RBI Deputy Governor Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra.



2.Near-inflation outlook to improve on price correction: The near-term inflation outlook is expected to improve on the back of vegetable price correction and the recent reduction in liquified petroleum gas (LPG) or cooking gas prices.

‚Äò‚ÄôWaning of transitory food price shocks, the ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions, improvement in supply chains, strong supply side intervention by the government, and likely lower rate of increase in selling prices by firms (as per the RBI enterprise surveys) is expected to moderate inflation to 5.2 per cent in Q4 2023-24 and further to 4.3 per cent in Q4 2024-25,'' said MPC member Dr. Rajiv Ranjan.



3.RBI's fundamental goal to align inflation with 4 per cent target: RBI's fundamental goal is to align inflation with the 4 per cent target and anchor inflation expectations. ‚Äò‚ÄôMonetary policy has to remain extra alert and ready to act, if the situation warrants. The hard earned macroeconomic stability has to be preserved,'' said the RBI Governor.

Inflation expectations of households ‚Äì both three months and a year ahead ‚Äì have moved together to single digit for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. ‚Äò‚ÄôMonetary policy must remain actively disinflationary to ensure that ongoing disinflation process progresses smoothly,'' said Das.



4.Inflation print to be monitored amid price pressures: MPC members agreed that even though the sharp increase in prices during July-August, now appears transitory, the pressures on price conditions still remain. Price pressures are likely to hurt headline inflation and near-term inflation prints need to be monitored carefully to look out for the moderation.

‚Äò‚ÄôThe future trajectory will be conditioned by a number of factors such as lower area sown under pulses, dip in reservoir levels, adverse weather and El Ni√±o conditions and volatile global energy and food prices,'' said the RBI.



5.Global headwinds pose downside risks to growth trajectory: Headwinds from global factors such as geopolitical tensions, volatile financial markets and energy prices, and climate shocks pose risks to the growth outlook.

‚Äò‚ÄôWeak global economic growth and external demand have kept the global price pressures down. The global fuel and energy prices volatility and firming up of some of the food commodity prices are a concern in the short-term, in view of the persistent geopolitical tensions and vulnerability to adverse climate shocks. Financial market volatility has also meant volatile capital flows,'' said MPC member Dr. Shashanka Bhide.

45,mint,US 10-year bond yields near 16-year high. How can it impact Indian stock market?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/us-10-year-bond-yields-near-16-year-high-how-can-it-impact-indian-stock-market-11697788651694.html,20 Oct 2023,,"The US 10-year Treasury yields are near their 16-year high level boosted by the prospects of another rate hike. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday said that more interest rate hikes may be required to bring inflation down to a 2 per cent target because of a tight labour market and resilient US economy.

As Mint reported, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday, October 19, that inflation in the US remains too high and bringing it down to the Fed's 2 per cent target level will likely require a slower-growing economy and job market.

US bond yields have gone up significantly, nearing the highest levels in 16 years. The prime reason for this is the uncertainty about future interest rates in the US. A few weeks ago, everyone thought that there would be only one more rate hike. However, experts point out that Fed Chairman Powell on Thursday surprised everyone by suggesting that there might be more rate hikes in the future due to the strong economy and tight job market.

Experts observed that just when markets were assuming that rates were high enough, this view from the Chief renewed the nervousness and brought US 10-year yields near the 5 per cent mark. These levels were last seen in the year 2007.

On Friday, US 10-year bond yields declined over a per cent and hovered near 4.94 per cent.

Why are US bond yields rising?

Bond yields are influenced by the Federal Reserve's interest rates. Experts say bond yields have been rising because of the current trend of higher interest rates. This can also be seen as an indirect signal of rising inflation and the anticipation of a potential economic slowdown, which in turn makes the cost of borrowing money higher.

Apart from this, increased bond supply and and macro as well as geopolitical uncertainty have also contributed to the rise in bond yields.

""The recent surge in nominal long-end yields has been led by: (1) increased supply in recent quarters, (2) higher real yields (which rose as markets faded recession risks) contributing more than inflation expectations (which have trended down amid negative inflation surprises in recent months), and (3) Fed repricing and soft landing narrative leading to higher term premia,"" observed Madhavi Arora, Lead Economist at Emkay Global Financial Services.

Alok Agarwal, Portfolio Manager at Alchemy Capital Management pointed out that since the early 1980s, US interest rates had been declining.

""Following the Global Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve chose to implement Quantitative Easing, an extraordinary stimulus program that included interest rate reductions and the purchase of government bonds,"" said Agarwal.

""Several attempts to restore normalcy have been attempted over the past ten years, but the markets have always responded with 'tantrums' particularly in 2013. A few months into the second effort, the world saw the outbreak of Covid, which unleashed even more easing, to the point that at one point over $15 trillion of global capital was invested in government bonds with negative yields,"" Agarwal said.

Agarwal underscored that the US inflation stayed under control during this entire period. But starting in 2021, the inflation reached multiyear and multi-decade highs, compelling the central banker to hike interest rates at a rate that has not been witnessed in at least four decades.

How can high US bond yields impact the Indian stock market?

When US bond yields rise, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) often divest from emerging market equities and allocate their investments towards US bonds. This shift is driven by the perception that bonds are less risky than equities and offer more attractive return potential.

Kaushik Dani, Fund Manager - PMS, Abans Investment Managers also believes higher bond yields are negative for the stocks.

He pointed out that high bond yields make elevated equity markets less attractive and risk-averse investors are the first ones to change the asset allocation. The risk-off strategy leads foreign investors to pull out money from emerging markets like India. This is because dollar returns for FPIs are better in US Treasury versus equities during that period.

Dani said not only foreign investors but even domestic institutions with hybrid objectives tend to shift funds from equity to debt. Overall, outflows from equities will keep the stock market under selling pressure, especially when valuations are trading at a premium to other emerging markets, Dani added.

Pawan Bharaddia, the co-founder of Equitree pointed out that higher bond yields generally lead to a flight of capital from equity to bond markets which we have been experiencing over the last two years where FIIs have been net sellers to the tune of nearly ‚Çπ2,78,000 crore in the calendar year 2022 and ‚Çπ37,000 crore since the beginning of the calendar year 2023.

Bharaddia said since equity valuation is inversely related to bond yields, one is seeing the concept of value investing coming back in vogue over the last couple of years leading to renewed interest in small and mid-cap companies.

""We believe that as the higher interest rate is likely to continue so will the genre of value investing continue attracting more interest in the small and mid-cap space,"" said Bharaddia.

Also Read: Why investing in US bonds may not be a good idea

Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research at StoxBox believes with the current 2 per cent inflation target being the lone data point focus for the Fed, any rate cut hopes have been pushed forward to late 2024. This may exert pressure on equities.

""With risk aversion being the order of the day, we may see some pain in high-yielding assets including Indian equities. The saviour for our markets is the overall well-rounded shape of the economy further supported by improved corporate earnings and rising domestic participation in markets,"" Chowdhury said.

Madhavi Arora of Emkay said still-rich equity valuations face increasing risk from high real rates and cost of capital, while earnings expectations for next year appear overly optimistic.

""Lags in the impact of high rates are longer this time, but we believe most of the negative effects are still to come. Our outlook on equities is to remain cautious ahead,"" said Arora.

Agarwal of Alchemy Capital Management underscored rising rates are intuitively not positive for equity markets. He said with US Treasury bonds giving 5 per cent dollar returns, the ask rate for equities goes up significantly if one were to adjust for risk premium and currency hedging.

Agarwal, however, believes the Indian market may fare better despite higher interest rates because of its robust economic growth prospects.

""India is in a special place. Finding another significant economy with a double-digit increase in corporate profits, double-digit nominal GDP growth, and double-digit ROEs (return on equities) is challenging. Higher rates imply that capital is not free or simple to obtain. However, it is never a barrier to something like what India provides, which is growth certainty. Rising rates are not a sign of strong equity, but given its advantages, India is predicted to fare better,"" said Agarwal.

The inflation is also moderating from its peak and will bolster macroeconomic fundamentals, the RBI bulletin showed.

‚ÄúGrowth is expected to gain momentum through the rest of the year, especially from the impetus of festival spending,"" the bulletin said.

‚ÄúVegetable prices may correct even more in October and expand disposable incomes of consumers,"" it added.

In September,the retail inflation eased to a three-month low of 5.02% on the back of softer vegetable prices, but remained above the RBI's medium-term target of 4%.

The current account deficit is modest and more than financed by the foreign exchange reserves providing a strong buffer, insulating the economy from global spillovers and the slowdown in external demand, the bulletin said.

The Indian rupee showed low volatility and orderly movements relative to peers despite elevated US treasury yields and a stronger dollar, it also said. ‚ÄúMovements in the INR are consistent with the strength of the underlying macro-fundamentals and the reassuring availability of buffers.""

The RBI sold a net $3.86 billion in the spot foreign exchange market in August, data showed on Thursday.

The RBI said it purchased $500 million and sold $4.36 billion during the period.

The RBI's net outstanding forward purchase stood at $10.07 billion as of end-August, compared with a net purchase of $19.47 billion at the end of the previous month.

In a report titled Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and Pacific, the IMF said that growth in Asia Pacific is expected to rise from 3.9% in 2022 to 4.6% in 2023. IMF staff estimate that Asia‚Äôs growth will slow to 4.2% in 2024 and to 3.9% in the medium term - the lowest in the past two decades except for 2020.

The IMF revised upwards India‚Äôs growth estimate to 6.3% in FY24, due to resilient domestic demand and strong investment inflows. Meanwhile, the Chinese economy, it said, is expected to expand 5% in 2023 and 4.2% in 2024, lower than 5.2% and 4.5%, respectively, estimated in April.

‚ÄúIn Asia‚Äôs advanced economies, tight financial conditions will hold back demand, while the outlook for exports will depend on price movements of global commodities (Australia, New Zealand) and the technology cycle (Korea, Singapore, Taiwan Province of China),"" it said.

Per IMF, in Asia‚Äôs emerging markets, relatively accommodative financial conditions will aid domestic demand despite monetary policy tightening, although external demand and sluggish investments will pose challenges.

China‚Äôs weaker near-term growth outlook will weigh on regional growth, it said, adding that the Chinese economy is expected to expand by 5% in 2023 and by 4.2% in 2024. Compared to the April 2023 World Economic Outlook, this is a downward revision of 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points, respectively on account of renewed weakness in the property sector despite more policy support than previously assumed.

The report pointed out that the global economic backdrop has remained challenging for economies in the Asia and Pacific region, with central banks tightening monetary policy across the globe. However, a fall in global commodity prices from the 2022 peak supported disinflation.

‚ÄúThe boost from China‚Äôs reopening in the first half of the year was above expectations. Strong private demand yielded positive growth surprises in India,"" it said.

While China‚Äôs inflation remains low and well-below target, reflecting falling food and fuel prices and still sizable economic slack, headline inflation in India rose in the third quarter due to a weather-related vegetable price shock.

According to the IMF, the emerging market economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) are expected to see growth of 4.2% in 2023 and 4.6% in 2024‚Äîa 0.3 percentage point downward revision relative to April. The downgrade, it said, reflects not only weaker external demand, but also lacklustre domestic demand as a result of monetary policy tightening.

The resilience of the Indian economy, improving macros and the ongoing September quarter corporate earnings are supporting the domestic market amid global geopolitical concerns.

Analysts believe market weakness can be used to buy high quality stocks, particularly in sectors like financials, automobiles and capital goods.

HDFC Securities have four fundamental stock picks for investors to buy at present prices and add on dips for a time horizon of two to three quarters.

Here are the fundamental picks by Retail Research, HDFC Securities.

Ahluwalia Contracts (India) | Buy | TP: ‚Çπ 771

Ahluwalia Contracts continues to see robust order flow prospects in healthcare, data centres, industrial structures apart from government buildings. Competitive intensity remains elevated but the company remains very selective in bidding for projects.

The company‚Äôs robust and diversified order book, strong bidding pipeline, timely execution could help to bring more orders going forward, HDFC Securities said.

Q1FY24 saw a dip in new TCVs as some deals got rolled over to Q2. Birlasoft plans to give salary hikes starting September 1st, which may have a negative impact on margins in the short term, according to the brokerage firm.

HDFC Securities has a base case target price of ‚Çπ560 and the bull case target price is ‚Çπ597 per share over the next two to three quarters. It suggests investors can buy in the ‚Çπ505-520 band and add further on dips in the ‚Çπ446-456 band.

49,mint,In charts: What India can do as age catches up with it,https://www.livemint.com/economy/the-silver-lining-in-india-s-imminent-ageing-problem-11697524222225.html,18 Oct 2023,,"India‚Äôs youthful population is often described as a key strength of the economy. India is among the youngest emerging market nations, and will remain so in the near future‚Äîa demographic dividend that makes it an attractive investment destination. According to the United Nations, a country is considered to be ‚Äúageing"" if the share of the population over the age of 65 is more than 7%, ‚Äúaged"" when the share exceeds 14%, and ‚Äúsuper-aged"" when it crosses 20%. India will not be super-aged until 2050, but most Brics members will attain this dubious distinction earlier.

Having grown used to the idea of a young, aspirational India, it is quite disconcerting to discover that a rising elderly population could pose significant social and economic challenges in the years ahead, as the recently released India Ageing Report 2023 by the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) noted. The experience is not unique to India: the gradual ageing of a population over time is a natural demographic shift caused by falling fertility rates and higher longevity. Thus, it is not the ageing per se, but the pace of ageing that is a matter of concern. The population of India has been ageing at a faster rate since the early 2010s. It took 67 years from 1950 to 2017 for the 65-plus population to double from 3.1% to 6%, but the next doubling is projected to happen in just 25 years. By 2050, one in five Indians will be over 60 years of age, that is, effectively a senior citizen.

Old and poor

An ageing population dampens GDP in several ways: older people usually don‚Äôt work, they pay less taxes and consume fewer items, all the while drawing down on pensions and social benefit schemes. Therefore, the economic cost of old age support increases with an ageing population. But India‚Äôs income is not likely to grow as rapidly as its elderly cohort. Worse, the working-age population (15 to 59 years) is expected to peak at 64.8% of the population by 2031, while the elderly population will keep rising. Even under the most optimistic growth assumptions, per capita GDP will remain lower than the $10,000 threshold until the 2040s. India runs the risk of growing old before it grows rich.

This will have two consequences: an older, potentially less productive workforce, and upward pressure on future fiscal deficits. Mitigating actions that India should seriously consider include bringing more women into the workforce, and harnessing the potential of the elderly.

Rethinking retirement

People retire when they reach the retirement age, have poor health, struggle to find work, or attain adequate pension or savings. Each factor can be looked at to find ways to enhance the elderly‚Äôs productivity. Raising the official retirement age could postpone pension spending. Though unpopular in rich countries‚ÄîFrance saw massive protests earlier this year after a similar move‚Äîopposition is less likely in India, where workers are often not well-prepared for retirement. The 2023 India Retirement Index Study shows that one in three urban workers worry about depleting their retirement corpus within five years.

Second, a government-backed active ageing programme to promote preventive health, incentivize upskilling, and discourage age-based discrimination is needed. Not all older workers can afford to or want to retire: surveys by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy show around 7% of 65-plus workers are working or looking for work. Thus, the mindset that older workers cannot contribute needs to be reversed.

Sustainable pensions

Pension coverage in India is quite inadequate. About 12% of the workforce has formal pensions; the rest‚Äîmainly informal sector workers‚Äîhave to depend on the public provident fund or post office savings schemes. Nevertheless, the shift from a defined benefit to a defined contribution system in 2004 was an important step towards sustainable pensions. Recent reversions (or promises to revert) by some states risks fiscal disaster.

An India-specific solution, such as the guaranteed pension scheme adopted by Andhra Pradesh, which combines aspects of the old and new systems while guaranteeing a minimum pension, offers an acceptable middle path. It may also be a good idea to market the new pension scheme or retirement-specific annuities better‚Äîafter all, the popularity of mutual funds owes much to its successful advertising campaign. A few far-sighted decisions can turn this impending old age crisis into an opportunity for reform.

50,mint,Thematic and hybrid mutual funds garnered higher inflows in Sept; here's why,https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/thematic-and-hybrid-funds-garnered-higher-inflows-in-sept-financial-advisors-explain-why-11697219088211.html,16 Oct 2023,,"The market is volatile owing to sudden and unexpected macro factors stemming from so many wars. For a dedicated long-term investor, this situation presents an opportunity to increase their holdings or initiate new investments. The age-old principle of ‚Äúbuy low, sell high"" continues to be a tried-and-true strategy in the stock market. Continued market upheavals in the past have not deterred long-term investors from putting their money in the market. This is evident from the recent data shared by the recently released Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) recent September data which highlighted inflows into the market worth ‚Çπ16,000 crores through regular systematic investment plan (SIP) investments.

Statistics also underscore more investors taking an active interest in thematic or sectoral funds owing to their competitive returns. Considering how investing in these funds involves a lot of risk, numbers suggest the growing risk-averse nature of investors amidst growing optimism regarding the performance of the Indian stock market.

A discussion with personal financial experts revealed possible reasons for growing interest in sectoral funds.

Hiren Thakkar, Chartered Accountant Proprietor, Hiren S Thakkar & Associates said, ‚ÄúAs per my understanding, investors are cautious and selective because we are trading at the top of the valuation channel. Therefore, investors have shown interest in the hybrid- Balanced advantage/multi-asset funds and sector-specific funds like ‚Äì IT and Pharma.""

Viral Bhatt, Founder, Money Mantra added, ‚ÄúThe Indian stock market has been performing well in recent months, with the Sensex and Nifty reaching new record highs in September. This positive market sentiment has boosted investor confidence and led to increased inflows into mutual funds. It is important to note that thematic/sectoral and hybrid funds are more volatile than diversified equity funds. This is because they invest in a concentrated portfolio of stocks or sectors. Therefore, investors should carefully consider their risk appetite and investment goals before investing in these funds.""

‚ÄúInvestors are rotating their funds into sectors and themes that are expected to perform well in the coming months. For example, sectors such as IT, banking, and financial services are expected to benefit from the strong economic growth in India. Similarly, themes such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, and consumption are expected to outperform the broader market in the coming years,"" added Bhatt.

Gaurav Goel, Founder-Director, Fynocrat Technologies explained, ‚ÄúHybrid funds have seen increased net inflows on a month-on-month basis. Diversification and risk management are pivotal considerations for investors venturing into mutual funds to maintain a balanced portfolio. The rise in investments in hybrid funds may be ascribed to investors' renewed focus on capital preservation. This trend can also be linked to the robust bull run in the equity markets, prompting investors to adopt a balanced approach to their investments.""

There's no denying that India's trajectory points to long-term structural growth, with the potential to reach a 10 trillion-dollar economy in the foreseeable future. For individual investors, mutual funds stand as a pivotal asset class to participate in India's growth narrative and potentially garner favourable returns over the extended term.

Traditionally, retail investors diversify their investments across various fund categories, including equity funds, balanced funds, or debt funds, aligning with their risk tolerance and investment horizon. However, recent trends in mutual fund investments reveal a notable shift. There is a discernible inflow of capital into thematic/sectoral funds and hybrid funds, influenced by several contributing factors. The overall positive market outlook, despite prevailing negative sentiments, contributes positively to India's stock market growth narrative.

Modern Palestine was populated with Jews from the global diaspora‚Äîa British imperial drive‚Äîin 1948. Around 750,000 Palestinians were expelled as Jews captured 78% of the land. The remainder were settled in Gaza and the West Bank. In 1967, Israel annexed the remaining Palestinian land from Jordan, Egypt, and Syria, expelling more Palestinians. In time, Israel became the protector of western interests in an oil-rich region. As to religion, the holy city of Jerusalem lies in Israel. Both sides claim the Temple Mount, venerated by Muslims, Jews, and Christians.

Who are the players in this war?

There are two main players. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, now in his sixth term, has been PM for more years than any other Israeli. But the right-wing politician has faced mass protests, including by military reservists, over plans to curb the judiciary‚Äôs powers. Hamas, an Islamic group which governs Gaza, is opposed to the very existence of Israel. Its political wing is headed by Ismail Haniyeh and the armed wing by Mohammed Deif. Sidelined by the Hamas attack is the moderate president of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas. Globally, he remains the face of Palestine.

What happened to the two-state solution?

The closest we came to it was the US-brokered Sep 1995 Oslo pacts between the head of the secular Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, and Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin. It ended when Rabin was shot by a Jewish extremist two months later. Now US President Joe Biden looks too preoccupied with domestic challenges and Ukraine to make a move on West Asia.

What are the global implications?

It may get Biden to finally consider brokering a peace in West Asia. The likely short-term fallout is worrying though: shooting oil prices, global recession, mounting resentment in the Islamic world and galvanized militant groups, led by the Lebanon-based Hezbollah. The role of Iran, which backs both Shia Hezbollah and Sunni Hamas, will be key. Netanyahu may solidify his position; equally he could be blamed for the military failure and ousted. There have been some calls already for a government of national unity.

What does the attack spell for India?

India has to be watchful about Pakistan and its deep state drawing opportunistic inspiration. A messy country will often seize upon such chances. The economic challenges are stiff: selling pressure on Monday drove the volatility index to its biggest rise in 10 months. With soaring crude prices, India‚Äôs dependence on cheap Russian oil will increase. Plans to build an India-Middle East-Europe corridor have come under a cloud. Civilians must be repatriated from Israel. And trade with Israel, at $12 bn, is likely to be seriously impacted.

So far, the war between Israel and Hamas has taken the lives of more than 1200 Israelis and has left more than 2,700 wounded, said Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus, Israel Defence Force (IDF) spokesperson on Wednesday. He also emphasised that the Israeli soldiers are ready to execute a mission in Gaza.

The recent surge in crude oil prices and the escalating geopolitical tensions stemming from the conflict in Israel have introduced additional headwinds to the market. Amid this intricate backdrop, all eyes are now turned towards the forthcoming festive season, which is expected to play a pivotal role in sustaining market momentum, said domestic brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher in its latest note.

The brokerage has stated that the risk-reward dynamics appear relatively balanced, with the NIFTY Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio currently at a 16.7% discount compared to the long-term historical average.

However, it's essential to note that the looming El Nino impact and the upcoming 2024 elections introduce a level of uncertainty. Yet, the potential for a stable government post-election and the continuation of sound economic policies holds the potential to drive the markets to new heights, added the brokerage firm.

The brokerage valued NIFTY at a 7.5% discount to the 10-year average to arrive at a bull case target price of 24,833. In the base case scenario, it valued NIFTY at a 15% discount (17.3x) to 10-year average PE (20.4x) with September 25 EPS of 1316 and arrived at the 12-month target of 22,819 (20,735 based on 18.2x March 25 EPS of ‚Çπ1138 earlier). Under the bear case scenario, the brokerage sets the Nifty 50 target at 20,135.

According to the brokerage, the second quarter (Q2FY24) will show the impact of volatile monsoons, flash floods in July, and delayed recovery in rural and consumer demand in a few segments. The demand scenario is mixed with strong demand from the upper and upper middle class while the lower class seems to be under some pressure.

Volatile weather conditions and food inflation during the quarter have also impacted sentiments. Discretionary spending on travel, tourism, and jewellery has been good, while QSR, apparel, and 2W have been impacted. PV continues to report strong numbers, the brokerage noted.

The brokerage remains overweight on auto, banks, IT services, capital goods, and healthcare. It has an underweight position on metals, cement, consumers, oil and gas, and diversified financials. It picked HDFC Bank, RR Kabel, Canfin Home, Navin Fluorine, and ABB to its conviction picks, while Safari Industries, Titan, Greenpanel, and Gujarat Gas have been removed from the high-conviction list.

Despite holding a positive outlook on Safari and Titan in the long term, it said the stocks offers a limited scope of further re-rating.

For growing at this speed, the country needs investment in areas such as mining, utilities, storage and transport, it said.

The focus should be on sectors that have stronger spillover effects, that in turn expedite the growth of the broader economy, as per the UK-based multinational lender.

‚ÄúHigher investment, especially in traditional sectors, should also have a positive impact on employment and household income, which is likely to be a key deliverable of the economic growth story pursued by policymakers,"" stated the note written by Barclays' senior economist in Mumbai, Rahul Bajoria.

In the period between 2005-10, the Indian economy had grown at an average of around 8 percent. The rate could be matched again following the Lok Sabha elections next year if the government sets the target, Barclays had suggested in another report last month. However, the focus should also be on maintaining macroeconomic stability.

On the basis of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures, Barclays said that China's contributions would account for an estimated 26 percent of the global GDP in the five-year period leading up to 2028. In the same period, India's contribution would be around 16 percent if the domestic growth rate remains at an average of 6.1 percent, it added, further pointing out that the gap with China could be narrowed if the Indian economy starts growing at 8 percent.

Meanwhile, the IMF, in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) report released on October 10, raised the FY24 growth forecast for India from 6.1 percent to 6.3 percent. The upward revision reflects the ‚Äústronger-than-expected consumption during April-June"", it said.

Monetary policy projections are consistent with achieving the Indian central bank's inflation target over the medium term, said the IMF. The country's current account deficit is expected to remain at 1.8 per cent of GDP in FY24 and FY25, the IMF added.

IMF cut its growth forecasts for China and the euro area and said overall global growth remained low and uneven despite what it called the ""remarkable strength"" of the US economy.

""The strongest recovery among major economies has been in the United States, where GDP in 2023 is estimated to exceed its pre-pandemic path.

On Saturday, Palestinian militants fired more than 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip toward Israel, killing at least 700 people and wounding thousands others, the worst attack on Israeli soil in decades.

In retaliation, Israel formally declared war and approved for ‚Äúsignificant military steps"", as the military crushed Hamas militants still in southern towns and intensified its bombardment of the Gaza Strip.

The toll passed 1,100 dead and thousands wounded on both sides, as fighting entered a third day.

Catch Israel-Palestine War Live Updates here

The fallout of Israel-Hamas war on the global economy may take time to become clear but would become more severe if the conflict spreads to the rest of the Middle East, especially Iran, which is both a major oil producer and supporter of Hamas.

‚ÄúA major channel of impact on the global economy would be via oil prices which have already risen near to $90 level. Further escalation of the conflict towards other Middle Eastern nations which are key oil producers poses a bigger threat and needs a very close watch given that the global economy is currently facing a ‚Äòhigher for longer‚Äô interest rate scenario,"" said Kanika Pasricha, Economist, Standard Chartered Bank.

Let us understand the impact of Israel-Hamas war on global economy and markets:

Oil prices boil

Crude oil prices surged sharply on Monday as the tensions escalated in the Middle East, home to almost a third of global oil supply.

Brent crude rose 3.44% to $87.49 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude rallied 3.85% to $85.98 a barrel.

However, the crisis is unlikely to pose any major immediate threat to the oil supply unless it further spreads to other countries in the region which could develop into a more devastating proxy war, embroiling the US and Iran.

While there are reports of Iran being involved in the attacks against Israel, any possible retaliation against Tehran could endanger the passage of vessels through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital conduit that Iran has previously threatened to close, analysts said.

‚ÄúThe issue is that if the war persists for long, which is say, even a fortnight onwards, then the oil dynamics will change. Brent had crossed the $90 mark but then retreated. Now we can use the 90 number to be the threshold beyond which there is trouble for the world economy. India can get affected if the price remains high due to further supply disruptions,"" said Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda.

Iran joining the fray can affect the sea routes and push up transport and insurance costs. Higher crude will distort our balance of trade and CAD thus putting pressure on the rupee.

Inflation

As the crude oil prices surge, the threat of high inflation grasps the global economy again. The United States, India, China and other major economies are big importers of oil and can see high imported inflation if the oil prices remain elevated.

When oil prices rise, the cost of production for various industries and energy costs for businesses and households also surge, driving inflation higher.

High energy prices and new inflationary trends could undermine the efforts of central banks to bring inflation under control. This can see interest rates at an elevated level for a prolonged period.

The concerns over higher interest rates dent outlook for global economic growth. With the US Fed clearly indicating one more hike in interest rates was on the cards and rates can stay elevated for a longer period has dealt a blow to investors' hopes that rate hikes have peaked and central banks could begin thinking about rate cuts.

India-Israel Trade

There is no immediate impact seen in India‚Äôs trade with Israel due to the conflict in West Asia. However, it can create supply-side problems if the conflict escalates, analysts said.

India‚Äôs exports to Israel account for 1.8% of India‚Äôs total merchandise exports led by petroleum products. Israel buys around $5.5 - 6 billion of refined petroleum products from India. In FY23, India‚Äôs total exports to Israel stood at $8.4 billion

‚ÄúTherefore the rupee depreciation is a distinct possibility which will require RBI action. The currency range will shift upwards to the ‚Çπ83-84 bracket in such a case,"" said Sabnavis.

On the other hand, India imports machinery, pearls, diamonds and other precious and semi-precious stones from Israel. In FY23, India‚Äôs imports from Israel were at $2.3 billion.

Global markets

The Israel-Hamas war has spooked equity markets all over with investors shifting towards safe-haven assets. Investors remain cautious and watchful of the global events with risk-off sentiment grappling the market.

The US stock futures declined while the Asian markets traded lower on Monday. Safe-haven gold prices rose over 1%.

Spot gold jumped 1.2% to $1,853.79 per ounce, while the US gold futures climbed 1.2% to $1,867.80.

Dollar and Japanese yen also edged higher. The dollar index was last 0.1% higher at 106.33.

‚ÄúThis is a time to be cautious. Investors may refrain from taking big risks. Wait for the developments to unfold. Long-term investors can slowly accumulate high quality stocks on declines,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors (FII) are continuously selling due to higher bond yields and high crude oil prices could add more issues.

However, analysts do not see a major immediate impact on the Indian stock market.

‚ÄúThe ongoing conflict in Israel is an unforeseen event impacting the market, and its effects may take some time to be fully absorbed. Monitoring the situation closely, especially regarding potential involvement of other actors like Iran, is essential. The possibility of a third front involving Iran is a significant concern as it could trigger a sharp increase in crude oil prices,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart.

From a technical standpoint, the 19,300‚Äì19,250 range is a critical demand zone for Nifty 50. Until the market stabilizes within this range, it's likely to remain in a sideways pattern, facing a notable obstacle at 19,800. A breach below 19,250 could lead to a healthy correction, potentially reaching the 18,800 level, he added.

‚ÄúFor short-term traders, it's advisable to exercise caution and not rush into trades. On the other hand, a substantial correction could present an excellent buying opportunity for long-term investors,"" Meena said.

Raj Vyas, VP of Research at Tejimandi said he did not think there was any cause of panic as far as the Indian stock market is concerned but the performance would be mirrored as to how the global markets do.

‚ÄúAt the moment we are not concerned because this Israel-Hamas is an evolving situation and needs to be tracked for a couple of days before we react to it. Since the earnings season will kick start from 11th October 2023, markets will keenly watch the report card and the management commentary to gauge the trajectory going ahead and state elections starting next month,"" Vyas said.

The Indian government has been proactive in supporting aspiring entrepreneurs through various initiatives including the Startup India scheme.

In 2022, Indian startups attracted a whopping $42 billion in funding, a substantial leap from the previous year's $16 billion which underscores their pivotal role in India's aspiration to achieve a $5 trillion economy goal. However, India's tech space has seen a huge decline in funding this year. Despite this, India remains one of the top-performing tech ecosystems globally.

Today, startups are catering to every need of consumers, that is, from B2B to B2C. Several sectors that shine in India include fintech, e-commerce, SaaS, D2C, Autotech, and others as these areas have consistently topped the investment charts, constituting a staggering 89% of total funding in H1 CY23.

The government‚Äôs roadmap to making India a $5 trillion economy comprises measures like focusing on inclusive growth, promoting a digital economy, fintech, technology-enabled development, energy transition, and climate action, and relying on a virtuous cycle of investment and growth.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recently also said, ‚ÄúIndia is the fastest-growing major economy in the world despite turbulence in the global economic situation. India will soon become a $5 trillion economy.""

Amidst the pool of 92,683 startups recognized by DPIIT, here are a few sectors that contributed to a massive boost in the Indian economy and further hold the potential to drive a $5 trillion economy by 2024:

1) Electronic Vehicles (EV): Startups are helping the EV space to create a sustainable ecosystem in collaboration with the government to further boost the transition, said Vaibhav Kaushik CEO and Founder of Nawgati.

‚ÄúThe EV market is expected to reach 17 million units sold by 2030. Today, over 486 EV startups are exploring opportunities and challenges in charging infrastructure, battery recycling, and energy storage solutions to enable green mobility in the country.""

2) FinTech: It is one of the most disrupted sectors in India with more than 87% adoption rate, said Kaushik, adding that around 6,386 startups have popped up over the last decade catering to distinct financial needs of consumers in India, ranging from insurance technology, digital lending, cashless economy, wealth management to blockchain.

‚ÄúThe fintechs have included consumers from Tier 2, Tier 3, and rural areas, strengthening the overall financial technology market opportunity, which is estimated to reach $1.3 trillion by 2025.""

3) Jobs Creation: Recognized start-ups have created over 10.34 lakh direct jobs for people in the country, according to Ravi K Ranjan, the founder of SuperAngels Summit 2023. He believes that India‚Äôs current accomplishments in the entrepreneurial sector are marking an influence worldwide with a potential that could cross the growth of 100,000 unicorns in India.

‚ÄúThese entrepreneurial ventures will act as dynamic catalysts, propelling economic growth through their innovative solutions and job creation. They infuse fresh ideas and technologies into the market, enhancing competitiveness and attracting foreign investment.""

4) Technology: One of the critical ways startups are contributing to India's $5 trillion economy vision is through their foray into cutting-edge technologies. ‚ÄúThey are not just disruptors, they are transformers,"" Balaji Jagannathan, Co-founder and Director of Paycorp.io told Livemint.

‚ÄúFrom advanced battery technologies, electric vehicle components, and self-driving technology to charging infrastructure, Indian startups are driving the EV space. Apart from this, it's a diverse landscape encompassing various sectors, including FinTech, EdTech, E-commerce, Social Networks, FoodTech, Logistics, Media, Entertainment, D2C Brands, SaaS, and HealthTech.""

5) Bilateral Trade: Navneet Singh, Founder and CEO of Avsar said that startups bolster India's exports, with software services exports hitting $156.7 billion in 2021-22. He believes that the US-India defense deals help in the growth of the Indian startup ecosystem.

‚ÄúCollaborations with the US, indicated by the $191 billion bilateral trade and investment in 2022, and initiatives like the US-India Defence Acceleration Ecosystem, further ignite the startup ecosystem's growth.""

6) Healthcare: There are numerous innovative ideas focused on better patient management, patient data analysis, and insurance claim management that startups are addressing to boost the healthcare sector in India, the Nawgati founder told us.

‚ÄúCurrent trends further suggest a 45.06% increase in the total investments in health tech startups, encompassing telemedicine and telecommunication services, robotic surgeries, AI-based medical solutions that assist in detecting diseases, and more.""

Last year, $19.4 billion was raised on India's equity capital markets, according to data from LSEG.

""Initial public offerings have come back and you have seen a flurry of block deal activity given where markets are. Now we are starting to see institutional share sales as well,"" said Ashu Khullar.

Foreign portfolio investors have bought a net $11 billion in equity so far this year, according to India‚Äôs National Securities Depository, helping to lift India's benchmark equity indexes to record highs.

Conversations around mergers are also on the rise, said Khullar, who said deals worth $85 billion have been struck so far this year, with Citi India holding a 22.6% market share.

""Given the interest in India as a market, at some point people will look at both organic and inorganic way to come into the market,"" Khullar said.

India's recent inclusion in JPMorgan's emerging markets bond index, which will potentially bring in $25-30 billion in debt inflows in the financial year ending March 2025, creates opportunities for Citi to offer a market platform, trading, sales and custody services to new investors, Khullar said.

The India opportunity

The Indian economy is forecast to grow at 6.5% in the financial year ending March 31, 2024, making it the fastest growing major economy.

Citi has been holding roadshows across Asia and Europe meeting with potential India investors, Khullar said. ""One thing we are consistently hearing is that every board wants to have an India strategy.""

Locally, the economy is seeing early signs of a pick-up in private investment not just from the large industrial conglomerates but also mid-sized companies, which bankers are now targeting more actively.

Citi India, which concluded a sale of its local consumer businesses to Axis Bank in March this year, is now focused on its institutional businesses.

A broader reorganisation underway at Citi globally, which will include layoffs and reassignments, is unlikely to further impact India, he said.

""If you are focused on institutional businesses at a country level, as we are now in India, frankly, it means no change for our business,"" he said.

India is the world‚Äôs fifth-largest economy after the US, China, Japan and Germany.

Political flip-flops or coalition constraints could impair the nation‚Äôs economic performance and hinder macroeconomic stability, Sitharaman said at the annual day celebrations of Shri Ram College of Commerce in the capital.

Sitharaman‚Äôs emphasis on political stability and the economic progress achieved under the current leadership comes as crucial national elections are due by May next year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third term for his government in 2024.

The finance minister noted global uncertainties around food and fertilizer supplies because of supply chain disruptions arising from the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

The minister said that India becoming the third-largest economy, surpassing Japan and Germany, cannot be taken for granted in an uncertain and volatile world.

Sitharaman said she would not accept if anyone says it is guaranteed that India will move from fifth position to third in a few years and that there is no need for a prime minister to take charge of it. ‚ÄúI think that is losing perspective of what it takes to move upwards,"" the minister said. Sitharaman said that real-world situations are quite different from economic theory, which assumes several factors remain unchanged while explaining things. In the existing world order, it is not possible to assume that many factors will remain unchanged, the minister said.

‚ÄúThere cannot be a more volatile macroeconomic situation globally. I am talking about the global situation, not just of India. In that situation, what is actually guaranteed?... Going upwards is not a guarantee, but maybe going downward (there is a) high risk. So, for anybody who indicates it is a given that India will move from fifth to third position, I am not sure they are making a fair comment. But what will bring in that kind of a, let us say, guarantee‚Äîif at all you want to say what will guarantee us moving from the fifth to the third‚ÄîI would say, political stability (and) policy consistency,"" the minister said. She added that any flip-flop from one government to another affects economic performance and macroeconomic stability. The minister also said industry has always sought stability and policy consistency.

Sitharaman said India needs a government with decisiveness, a futuristic vision, readiness for reforms and policy consistency for businesses to grow. ‚ÄúThat is exactly what makes a difference between the kind of decision-making we have done and which did not happen some time ago, pulling the country backwards,"" the minister said. She also defended the way the government handled people‚Äôs needs during the pandemic, explaining that the government provided food to the needy and scaled up the funds for the rural jobs scheme.

The S&P Global India services Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index (PMI) stood at 61 in September, up from 60.1 in August. The figure stood at 62.3 in July, 58.5 in June and 61.2 in May.

A reading above 50 hits an expansion in activity, while a number below suggests a contraction.

India‚Äôs services PMI has held firm in the expansion zone every month since August 2021, its longest such stretch since August 2011.

""The latest PMI results brought more positive news for India's service economy, with September seeing business activity and new work intakes rising to one of the greatest extent in over 13 years,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

""Moreover, an upturn in business optimism about the year ahead, fuelled by buoyant demand conditions, bode well to further growth across the service sector,"" she added.

India‚Äôs services sector, one of the fastest growing in the world, contributes to over 50% of the country‚Äôs GDP.

According to S&P, Indian firms noted an upturn in demand from abroad, particularly from clients based in Asia, Europe and North America.

However, the overall rate of growth was one of the quickest seen in the series history (since September 2014), despite slowing to a three-month low, S&P said in the survey.

‚ÄúThe latest data showed a substantial increase in new business placed with Indian service providers, one that was the second-fastest since June 2010. Anecdotal evidence indicated that market dynamics remained favourable, supporting demand,"" it added.

The S&P Global India Services PMI is compiled from responses to questionnaires sent to about 400 service sector companies.

The survey said that the input cost inflation retreated substantially in September with the rate of increase equal to its long-run average and one of the weakest since late-2010.

‚ÄúSome firms opted to pass on to their clients additional cost increases by raising selling prices. At the same time, others suggested that charges were left unchanged amid attempts to secure new customers,"" the survey said.

‚ÄúThe overall rate of charge inflation was solid, though the softest in six months,"" it added.

The PMI data is an indicator of the health of the economy.

According to government data, the Indian economy expanded by 7.8% in the first quarter of the current fiscal year on higher government and private capital expenditure, and strong services growth. India‚Äôs GDP recorded a growth of 6.1% in the January to March 2023 quarter, pushing the annual growth (for FY23) to 7.2% from 7% estimated earlier.

On 3 September, S&P Global released its survey on India‚Äôs purchasing managers‚Äô index (PMI) for manufacturing for August, which grew at the slowest pace in five months at 57.5 after new factory orders softened from their high in September.

The composite PMI, consisting of both the manufacturing and services indices, rose to 61 in September from 60.9 in August on the back of higher sales in services.

69,mint,How surge in US bond yields impacts Indian stock market,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/bond-yields-spike-amid-bets-of-interest-rates-staying-higher-for-longer-how-will-it-impact-indian-stock-markets-11696411663543.html,04 Oct 2023,,"The Indian stock market indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, dropped nearly a percent on Wednesday tracking weak global cues amid surging US Treasury yields and a spike in dollar.

The ongoing rout in global bond markets saw US bond yields reach 16-year highs, souring appetite for risk assets on bets that interest rates will remain persistently high.

The benchmark US 10-year bond yield scaled fresh 16-year highs. The yield on the 10-year note was hovering around 4.85% in Asian hours, its highest level since August 2007. The 30-year yields touched 5% for the first time since 2007.

The spike in Treasury yields lifted the dollar to new heights. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six peers, hit a nearly 11-month high of 107.34 in the previous session. On Wednesday, the dollar eased 0.12% to 106.94.

On the domestic front, the Indian government bond yields continued to rise, with the benchmark bond yield reaching levels last seen nearly six months ago.

The 10-year benchmark bond yield was around 7.2442% after hitting 7.2612%, its highest since April 18, earlier in the session. The bond closed the previous session at 7.2327%.

Why are bond yields rising

Strong economic data in the US and hawkish comments from the US Federal Reserve officials have raised bets that the interest rates will remain higher for longer, leading to a spike in bond yields.

US job openings unexpectedly rose in August, pointing to tight labor market conditions that could compel the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month, with the odds rising above 30%, Reuters reported.

According to the Labor Department‚Äôs monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, job openings jumped 690,000 to 9.610 million on the last day of August.

Additionally, US Federal Reserve officials say that monetary policy will need to stay restrictive for ‚Äúsome time"" to bring inflation back down to the Fed‚Äôs 2% target.

‚ÄúI remain willing to support raising the federal funds rate at a future meeting if the incoming data indicates that progress on inflation has stalled or is too slow to bring inflation to 2% in a timely way,"" Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said Monday.

Cleveland Fed leader Loretta Mester also said the Fed‚Äôs work is likely not done.

‚ÄúI suspect we may well need to raise the fed funds rate once more this year and then hold it there for some time as we accumulate more information on economic developments and assess the effects of the tightening in financial conditions that has already occurred,"" Mester said in a speech to a group in Cleveland.

Impact on Indian stock market

Rising bond yields have spooked the stock markets as investors tend to shift away from risky assets. The surge in US treasury yields negatively impact the capital flows into emerging markets, such as India.

The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been offloading Indian equities as rising bond yields and the dollar acted as catalysts for the selloff.

The foreign investors sold Indian equities worth ‚Çπ14,768 crore in September and ‚Çπ2,868 crore in October so far, as per data available on NSDL.

‚ÄúThe sustained rise in the US bond yields, which has triggered continuous FII selling, is showing no signs of abating. The dollar index is now clearly above 107 and the US 10-year bond yield is at 4.83 per cent. This means FIIs will continue to sell and the bulls will be on the back foot,"" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

Impact on gold prices

The sustained selloff in the US treasuries has also weighed heavily on international gold prices.

Spot gold eased 0.2% to $1,819 per ounce, while US gold futures dropped 0.3% to $1,835.50. Gold prices fell for a seventh consecutive session on Tuesday to touch their lowest level since March at $1,813.90, Reuters reported.

On the domestic front, gold prices have fallen nearly 3% in the month of September. On Wednesday, MCX gold was trading around 0.13% lower at ‚Çπ56,854 per 10 grams.

Expectations from RBI

The three-day meeting of the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) began on Wednesday and its outcome is due on Friday. The RBI policy meeting comes amid the environment of selloff in bond markets, spike in yields, FII selling, rupee hovering near all-time low and rising crude oil prices raising concerns over high inflation.

However, most economists expect the central bank to maintain the status quo on policy rates but maintain its hawkish policy stance.

‚ÄúWith growth remaining steady, the RBI will prefer to stay watchful of the risks from the external sector and inflation. The MPC will keep the repo rate at 6.5 per cent with the stance retained at the withdrawal of accommodation. The RBI will aim to keep external risks at bay by acting on liquidity and forex and bond market interventions,"" Suvodeep Rakshit, Senior Economist at Kotak Institutional Equities, wrote for Mint.

India's retail inflation remained above the upper end of the central bank's 2%-6% tolerance band for a second consecutive month in August, though it eased from a 15-month high of 7.44% in July.

""Seasonal factors in inflation rate are beginning to become favourable and hence a reduction in inflation by December is very likely,"" Somanathan said.

ALSO READ: RBI may keep repo rate unchanged for fourth time

Sharp spikes in food prices have been the main driver for inflation as erratic weather conditions hurt production of staples like vegetables, milk and cereals.

The Indian central bank has forecast retail inflation falling to 5.7% in the December quarter, cooling further to 5.4% in fiscal 2024.

Somanathan also said that even after the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JPMorgan's widely tracked emerging market debt index, the country's ""policy discretion remains completely open in terms of regulation and taxation to safeguard our macroeconomic interests.""

Last month JPMorgan said it will include India's local bonds in its Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) from June 28, 2024.

The finance secretary added that India remains committed to reaching a fiscal deficit of below 4.5% of gross domestic product by 2025/26. The country is targeting a fiscal deficit of 5.9% for the financial year ending March 31, 2024.

As per details, 14 states raised ‚Çπ22,500 crore through the issuance of state government securities. This was in line with the indicated amount for this weekly auction for the third quarter calendar.

Chief economist at Icra Ratings, Aditi Nayar pointed out that the auctions saw a steep surge in the cut-offs across tenors leading to the weighted average cost jumping to a 23-week high of 7.56 percent. Earlier last week, it stood at 7.46 percent.

Adding more, Nayar said the higher pricing of the borrowing is despite a steep decline in the weighted average tenor to 13 years from 17 years.

The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index , compiled by S&P Global, fell to 57.5 last month from 58.6 in August.

September data showed a let-up in the recent surge in costs faced by Indian goods producers. After quickening to a one-year high in August, the rate of inflation receded to its lowest mark in over three years.

‚ÄúIndia's manufacturing industry showed mild signs of a slowdown in September, primarily due to a softer increase in new orders which tempered production growth. Nevertheless, both demand and output saw significant upticks, and firms also noted gains in new business from clients across Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

‚ÄúManufacturers held a strongly positive outlook for production, as they expect demand to strengthen over the course of the coming 12 months. Upbeat forecasts continued to drive job creation efforts and initiatives to replenish input stocks. Together, these indices point towards a favourable trajectory for the Indian manufacturing industry,""

However, while robust demand was supportive of production growth, it added to price pressures in September. The solid increase in output charges signalled by the PMI data, which occurred in spite of a notable retreat in cost pressures, could restrict sales in the coming months, added De Lima.

New orders, the largest sub-component of the PMI, rose at a softer pace in September. That said, the latest increase was sharp and historically strong. Where an expansion in sales was reported, survey participants cited favourable demand trends, positive market dynamics, and fruitful advertising.

Inflation in India eased in August to 6.83% from July's 15-month high of 7.44% but remained above the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) target range of 2%-6%.

73,mint,"Why Nashik onion traders are on indefinite strike, how it may affect prices",https://www.livemint.com/economy/why-nashik-onion-traders-are-on-indefinite-strike-how-it-may-affect-prices-11696262645218.html,02 Oct 2023,,"In Maharashtra's Nashik, where Asia's largest onion wholesale market is located, traders of the bulb are on an ‚Äúindefinite strike"". Efforts to end the stalemate over the last 10 days have failed, with the traders' association on October 1 announcing that the boycott of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in the district will continue till their concerns are addressed.

The indefinite strike was called on September 21, after the Centre did not agree to roll back the 40 percent duty imposed on the export of onions. The Nashik District Onion Traders‚Äô Association claimed that the duty would severely dampen the wholesale price, thereby affecting their earnings as well as the return on crop expected by the farmers.

The duty was imposed in August, when data for the preceding month showed food inflation at an alarming 11.51 percent. Government officials pointed out that such a measure was necessitated to keep the domestic stock of onion in check.

The stock at present is already considered to be stressed to some extent, as over 30,000 hectares of summer crop was damaged due to untimely rains in April, and the overall area of onion acreage was reduced to 2.31 lakh hectares in this season as against 2.53 lakh hectares in the year-ago period.

Exciting news! Mint is now on WhatsApp Channels. Subscribe today by clicking the link and stay updated with the latest financial insights!"" Click here!

Apart from the export duty, another point of grievance for the Nashik traders is the use of APMCs in the region to offload their ware by the National Cooperative Agricultural Marketing Federation (NAFED) and the National Cooperative Consumer Federation (NCCF). The two government agencies, which procure directly from the farmers, offload their stock in the wholesale markets, thereby keeping the prices in check.

Traders said they cannot compete with NAFED and NCCF in terms of cost, and are therefore unable to match their prices. An officer from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, however, told The Indian Express that the demand to bar the agencies from using the open wholesale markets is untenable as ‚Äúwe do not have any separate retail channels to offload our procured onions"".

The third major demand raised by the traders is the market cess imposed on them by the mandis. Traders, in their meeting with the state officials, said the 1 percent cess levied by the markets in Nashik is ‚Äútoo high"".

No immediate effect seen

Over 10 days into the strike, no major effect has been seen on the wholesale as well as the retail prices of onions. One of the foremost reasons is that the markets of India's North and North East are currently being supplied with onions from Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, a trader explained, adding that the markets in South are recipients of the bulb supplied from Pune, Ahmednagar and Karnataka.

‚ÄúThe status quo is likely to remain for the next few days, but the possibility of a price hike by next month cannot be ruled out,"" a trader based in Vashi APMC told this publication. The reason is that the existing supplies may get exhausted by the middle or end of November, and the new stock is not expected to reach the markets before November-end.

The delay in the arrival of new stock is linked to the late plantation of this season's onion due to the deferred onset of Monsoon. Instead of June, the crop was planted in July, the trader pointed out.

When the existing supplies are exhausted, markets across the country would rely on suppliers from Nashik, where the highest amount of onions is procured from. This makes the resolution of the current stalemate with the district's traders essential, the trader explained.

The current prices, point out reports, have also remained unchanged as trading has not totally come to a grind in Nashik. Vinchur mandi, a sub-market under the Lasalgaon APMC, has not been boycotted by the traders' association, even as they have stopped offloading their ware at the 14 large mandis. In the trading session on September 29, a total of 18,000 quintals of onion were traded in the Vinchur market, within a price range of ‚Çπ1,100 to ‚Çπ2,501 per quintal. The average rate, said a trader, was around ‚Çπ2,175 a quintal.

Also, the erstwhile BJP government in the state, headed by Devendra Fadnavis, had irregularised onion from the list of commodities that are to be traded only under the APMC's watch. This allows the traders to directly procure from the farmers and offload the supplies at retail markets, another trader explained, adding that in such a scenario, the only loss-making entity for the short-term period will be the mandis, which are losing out on their 1 percent cess.

This was largely due to a sharp jump in capital expenditure, which was offset by lower tax devolution to state governments, and an increase in non-tax revenues, analysts said.

In the year-ago period, fiscal deficit was at ‚Çπ5.42 trillion, or 32.6% of the FY23 target of Rs16.61 trillion.

The Centre aims to bring down fiscal deficit‚Äîthe difference between the government‚Äôs income and spending‚Äîto 5.9% of gross domestic product during fiscal 2024.

Capital expenditure (capex) rose to ‚Çπ3.74 trillion during April-August from ‚Çπ2.52 trillion in the same period a year ago.

Total receipts during April-August stood at ‚Çπ10.29 trillion, or 37.9% of annual estimates, of which tax receipts stood at ‚Çπ8.04 trillion, or 34.5% of annual estimates.

Corporate tax collections rose over 15% year-on-year to ‚Çπ2.39 trillion during the period under review, the data showed. Total expenditure rose to ‚Çπ16.72 trillion, or 37.1% of the annual estimates, from ‚Çπ13.90 trillion in the corresponding period in FY23.

Aditi Nayar, chief economist and head of research and outreach at rating agency Icra Ltd., said that the dip in the amount of tax devolution to states last month restricted the widening of fiscal deficit.

Nayar said while the tax devolution in August 2023 was in line with the previous month, it was lower in annual terms as a double tranche had been released in the year ago period.

""As a result, net tax revenues for the month of August 2023 stood at a healthy ‚Çπ2.2 trillion, a multi fold increase from the muted ‚Çπ0.3 trillion in August 2022,"" she said.

‚ÄúTo meet the latter, the government has to release ‚Çπ7.1 trillion to the states in the next eight months, which is 5% lower than the amount devolved in August-March in the financial year 2023,"" she added.

In May, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had approved a transfer of ‚Çπ874.2 billion as dividend to the government for FY23. This will likely cushion against undershooting of government's other revenue streams (not meeting the divestment target) and overshooting of expenses (MGNREGA).

""To meet the FY2024 BE (budget estimates), the GoI (Government of India) has to release ‚Çπ6.4 trillion to the states in the next seven months, which is nearly the same as the amount devolved in Sept-March in FY2023 as per Icra's calculations,"" Nayar said, adding that this would contain the incremental fiscal deficit in some of the ensuing months.

Of the total revenue expenditure, which stood at ‚Çπ12.98 trillion during the April-August period, ‚Çπ3.7 trillion was on account of interest payments and ‚Çπ1.81 trillion went into subsidies.

78,mint,Mint Explainer: What the widening current-account deficit means for the economy,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/mint-explainer-what-the-widening-current-account-deficit-means-for-the-economy-11695980473540.html,29 Sep 2023,,"New Delhi: India's current account deficit (CAD) widened in the April-June quarter to $9.2 billion or 1.1% of GDP from $1.3 billion in the preceding three months. The September quarter is expected to see a substantial widening of the deficit as the trade balance has been worsening sequentially, oil and higher core imports are rising, and services exports are slowing further. Mint explains the relevance of the data in the context of the Indian economy

What is CAD? How is it different from balance of payments?

The current account measures the flow of trade, including goods and services and investments in and out of a country. Net income, including interest and dividends, as well as transfers like foreign aid, are also included in the current account.

Balance of payment on the other hand is the difference in the value of payments into and out of a country over a period. While the current account is the sum of net income from abroad, net current transfers, and the balance of trade, balance of payments includes the current account and the capital account.

Why did India's CAD widen during June quarter?

The widening was due to a growing trade deficit, reduced net services surplus, and decreased private transfer receipts. The trade deficit, the largest component of the CAD, occurs when the value of a country‚Äôs imports exceed the value of its exports.

What does this mean for the economy?

A country may need to borrow money to close the gap if it is unable to finance its current-account deficit through investments. This may result in higher levels of debt, which is detrimental to the economy. A large deficit can lead to reduced government spending, lower investment and higher inflation, all of which can hamper economic growth. Also, when a country's imports exceed its exports, it can lead to a decrease in demand for its currency and thus depreciation. This can in turn fuel inflation and reduce purchasing power.

What can India do to narrow the deficit?

There are several measures a country can take to narrow its current-account deficit. These include boosting exports by providing incentives for exporters, easing export regulations, and negotiating better trade deals with other countries. The government can also help reduce import by providing incentives to domestic manufacturers and implementing tariffs and duties on certain imports. Other measures include improving productivity and competitiveness of domestic manufacturers through policy interventions that could help increase exports in the long term.

What is India's CAD outlook for the coming quarters?

Economists have warned that sustained increases in the price of crude oil ‚Äì of which India is a net importer ‚Äì will exert considerable pressure on the rupee, given that inflows have weakened due to rising US interest rates and the strengthening of the dollar. The current account deficit is expected to widen in the coming quarter if crude prices continue to rise. Economists at the Bank of Baroda expect the CAD to be in the region of 1.5-1.8% of GDP for the year."

This move aims to keep the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout programme on track and avoid a full-blown economic crisis.

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, the caretaker Finance Minister, revealed in a policy statement that the government was working on an economic revival blueprint. Although limited in its power to execute deep-seated structural reforms, the caretaker government pledges to fulfil IMF conditions to unlock a $700 million loan instalment. The discussions with the IMF are slated to begin by October end.

Dr Akhtar pointed out, as per DAWN, that it was crucial for Pakistan to fulfil its commitments under the IMF programme for the sake of economic continuity. In June, the IMF already agreed, in principle, to a nine-month Stand-by Arrangement worth about $3 billion with Pakistan.

The finance minister also touched on the external financing gap. Despite its current initiatives, Pakistan's financing needs surpass the available funding. The government is hopeful that combined efforts with stakeholders will attract project pipeline disbursements and resuscitate policy-based financing from multiple international bodies.

‚ÄúTo meet the external financing requirements, we are working to secure concessional funding from multilaterals (World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank) of $6.3bn,"" DAWN quoted the minister as saying.

Amid these financial arrangements, the finance minister sent out a cautionary note. She flagged the escalating international commodity prices, notably Brent crude oil, which surged to $95 per barrel this September, as a significant risk to Pakistan's external stability.

The caretaker government isn't merely looking outward for financial relief. It's focusing inward too, pushing for amendments in tax laws to include retail, agricultural, and real estate sectors effectively. A further ‚Çπ3 trillion is expected to be generated by resolving pending court cases.

Though the report, released on 27 September, acknowledges India's infrastructure improvements, it underscores the need for further enhancement in talent competitiveness.

However, the IMD praised India's talent pool for its agility, tech-savviness, and readiness for the future. ""Indians are seen as well-prepared for global roles, thanks to their linguistic diversity and international exposure,"" the report.

The IMD World Talent Ranking considers various factors, including quality of life, statutory minimum wage, and primary and secondary education. India fares reasonably well in future readiness, ranking 29th. However, the report highlights India's weak educational system, ranking it second to last (63rd) in quality. This is attributed to unequal access to education, particularly in rural areas, and insufficient investment.

Professor Bries added, ""Increasing investment in education is a straightforward solution that requires strong political commitment, as it is the most critical investment a country can make.""

The IMD in its report mentions that India needs comprehensive policies, including salary increases and improvements in quality of life, safety, and environmental friendliness to retain talent domestically.

In the IMD World Talent Ranking 2023, Switzerland ranked on top, while Luxembourg was in second place, followed by Iceland, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

The United States is ranked 15th, while China is at 41st place, and the UK ranks 35th. Brazil (63rd) and Mongolia (64th) occupy the bottom two spots.

In October, IMD is planning to release the Hinrich-IMD Sustainable Trade Index, while in November, it will release the IMD World Digital Competitiveness Ranking, following earlier releases of the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking and the IMD Smart City Index.

81,mint,Can a US shutdown trigger a knee-jerk reaction in Indian stock market?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/can-a-us-shutdown-trigger-a-knee-jerk-reaction-in-indian-stock-market-experts-weigh-in-11695800611992.html,27 Sep 2023,,"Just about four months after averting a first-ever default, the US is on the cusp of another financial crisis. The federal government is staring at a possible shutdown which means many government services will stop, government employees will face difficulties, and there could be political turmoil too.

This situation has arisen because, as per media reports, some Republicans in the House of Representatives want to reduce government spending significantly. They are pushing for a showdown on how the government's money is used.

What is a US shutdown?

In literal terms, a shutdown means a temporary suspension of various government services and functions. A US government shutdown occurs when the federal government's funding runs out.

Every financial year before September 30, some 438 government agencies rely on Congress for funding allocation. Government funding expires October 1 which is the start of the federal fiscal year and a failure by lawmakers to pass these bills before the commencement of the new fiscal year results in these agencies experiencing disruptions in their regular operations.

As Mint reported earlier, the Congressional Research Service has recorded 14 instances of government shutdowns since 1981, with many of them being brief, lasting merely a day or two. The most recent shutdown, which occurred in December 2018 and extended into January 2019, was also the lengthiest, spanning 35 days. This extended closure was attributed to a disagreement concerning border security.

The US shutdown will impact several departments of the US government, including education, healthcare and law and order even though some highly essential government entities will continue to function.

Some of the key economic data, including monthly unemployment figures and price reports, would be temporarily suspended in case of a shutdown, affecting market sentiment and possibly leading to investor uncertainty.

The impact of a US shutdown could be significant on its economy but is unlikely to trigger a knee-jerk reaction in the domestic market, experts say.

(Exciting news! Mint is now on WhatsApp Channels. Subscribe today by clicking the link and stay updated with the latest financial insights! Click here!)

Limited impact on the Indian market

Many analysts think that the US will avoid a shutdown and the market will not see a major reaction to it.

V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services underscored news of the US Federal government shutdown has always been hot news leading to a lot of anxiety and concerns. However, Vijayakumar says historically, it has been seen that the Republicans and Democrats reach an agreement at the eleventh hour.

""History will repeat this time also. Markets will ignore this,"" said Vijayakumar.

Also Read: Global economic slowdown may not significantly impact India, says Amitabh Mohanty of JM Financial Mutual Fund

G. Chokkalingam, Founder and Head of Research at Equinomics Research pointed out that a shutdown wouldn‚Äôt make any significant impact on the Indian markets.

""As it is related only to government organisations and their employees, it wouldn‚Äôt impact corporate earnings in any significant manner. Also, in a few days or a couple of weeks, some temporary solutions would be found as it happened in the past several times. If the shutdown extends much longer, public anger in the US will turn against all politicians. Hence, US politicians would ultimately find a solution to this problem within a few weeks. Therefore, I will not affect Indian equity markets in any significant manner,"" said Chokkalingam.

Nitin Agrawal, CEO of Torus Oro PMS believes that the US government shutdown is unlikely and the uncertainty leading to shutdown is not going to impact the Indian markets.

""In the past several times, the US Republicans and Democrats have been able to reach an agreement to avoid a government shutdown. However, to avoid the shutdown, the US government must continue its spending spree. US government debt has already risen to historically high levels and further increases in debt would result in upward pressure on US yields. Higher US rates would result in the reduction of FPI flows in Indian markets as witnessed this month. But overall, the uncertainty over the US government shutdown is not going to impact Indian markets meaningfully,"" said Agrawal.

Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research, StoxBox believes that the US government would not risk running the government shutdown for long as the last 34-day shutdown from December 2018 to January 2019 had damaged Trump‚Äôs poll ratings.

""Overall, we do not expect a major knee-jerk reaction in Indian markets as the case has been in the past as well,"" said Chowdhury.

Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities pointed out that although the US shutdown does not have any direct impact on the Indian economy or markets, past US shutdowns in 2013 and 2018 and the recent scare in December 2022 saw Indian markets eroding a bit ahead of the dates and post the resolution either going flat or inching up a bit.

Jasani said that there are multiple triggers at this time which could influence the market.

""We will have to be cognizant of the fact that at any time many triggers may be in the works and it may be difficult to attribute market moves to a single trigger,"" said Jasani.

82,mint,Mint Explainer: What plummeting household savings mean for the economy,https://www.livemint.com/economy/mint-explainer-what-plummeting-household-savings-mean-for-the-economy-11695798624355.html,27 Sep 2023,,"Financial savings of India households have fallen to a five-decade low, according to data released by the Reserve Bank of India on September 18. This has many potential ramifications. It could slow down economy growth, for one. Mint delves deeper into the development.

Has there been a change in how Indian households approach finances?

Yes. They have been saving less and borrowing more to spend. The net financial savings of Indian households, which includes bank deposits, stocks, bonds and insurance policies, dropped to ‚Çπ13.8 trillion in 2022-23, or 5.1% of GDP. This was the lowest savings rate in 47 years. In 2020-21 household savings were at ‚Çπ22.8 trillion or 11.5% of GDP. The worrying part is the increase in household liabilities, which have shot up by 76%. Borrowings (personal, auto and home loans) have risen sharply.

View Full Image (Graphic: Satish Kumar/Mint)

What‚Äôs causing this change?

There are many potential reasons. First, household income has either stagnated or fallen in recent years. At the same time inflation ‚Äì in food, fuel, healthcare and education ‚Äì has risen consistently. This has eaten into households‚Äô disposable income and impaired their ability to save. However, a smaller surplus has not stopped people from spending on consumer goods, services, gold and real estate. Private consumption increased by 7.5% in 2022-23 and by 6% in the first quarter of 2023-24 as people borrowed to fund their purchases. That explains why borrowings from banks rose by 57% and retail loans increased by 21% in 2022-23 over the previous year.

Is rising consumerism a reason?

It is indeed a critical factor. Consumerism, which got a leg-up thanks to the post-pandemic spending spree, continues to be fuelled by things like EMIs, cash-back schemes and so on. Household liabilities have thus risen by ‚Çπ11 trillion in just 12 months. As a percentage of GDP, they grew by 5.8% in 2022-23 ‚Äì the second annual growth in India‚Äôs history after 6.7% in 2006-07.

What are the implications of this?

A high savings rate (including both financial and non-financial or physical assets such as gold, real estate, etc) is a prerequisite for high economic growth. In 2022-23, though the savings rate (30.2%) was higher than the 28.8%) recorded in 2021-22, it was at least six percentage points lower than the optimal level required for 8% or higher economic growth. The savings rate was high in 2004-12, peaking at 37% in 2010-11. That was when India saw rapid economic growth.

Should the government be worried?

The government has tried to dispel fears, claiming people have shifted their investments to non-financial assets. But the fact that income levels are stagnant and that people are borrowing to spend should worry the government as it means the current consumption growth is unsustainable. If consumption falls going forward, it will hurt growth. The government depends on financial savings to fund its infrastructure spending. Lower savings means it will have to rely on volatile foreign capital. Also, financial savings are the principal means of funding the government‚Äôs fiscal deficit."

Asia's third-largest economy is projected to grow 6.3% in FY25, the same as predicted last month, according to the median forecasts in the September 20-26 poll of 65 economists conducted by Reuters. Forecasts for this fiscal year ranged widely from 4.6% to 7.1%.

India's economic growth will be supported by government spending ahead of May's general election, according to a Reuters poll of economists who did say the forecast risks were skewed to the downside.

After a stellar 7.8% expansion last quarter, economic growth was expected to moderate to 6.4% in July-September quarter and then drop to 6.0% in the October-December period before slowing to 5.5% in early 2024.

A majority of economists, 22 of 36, who answered an additional question said the risks to their FY 2023/2024 GDP growth forecasts were skewed to the downside.

While Narendra Modi's government increased spending in the past few years to build roads, railways, and other infrastructure, helping India defy the global slowdown trend, it has so far failed to create enough jobs.

But most economists said expected growth was still well below potential and a drier than normal monsoon season so far could act as a restraint in an economy where agriculture employs about half the workforce in a country of over 1.4 billion people, Reuters reported.

While the poll showed India's retail inflation would average 5.5% this fiscal year and 4.8% next, above the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs (RBI) medium-term target of 4%, over two third of economists, 23 of 34, said the risks were skewed that it would be higher.

Even though inflation was not expected to reach that goal across the forecast horizon, economists expect the next move from the Reserve Bank of India to be a cut, the Reuters report said.

Nearly 60% of economists, 28 of 48, forecast the RBI to have cut rates by at least 25 basis points before July with the median putting it at 6.25% in the second quarter of next year.

All but one of the 71 economists surveyed said the RBI would keep its key repo rate unchanged at 6.50% at the conclusion of the October 4-6 meeting, with one expecting a 25 basis point hike. Median forecasts showed it staying there for the rest of this fiscal year.

In an email interaction with Live Mint , Ramachandran points towards the country's ""conducive environment"" to attract global investments, the economic prospects vis-√†-vis China and other Asia Pacific (APAC) nations, how India can leverage from advancements in artificial intelligence and whether its net-zero goals are aligned with the growth vision.

Edited excerpts from the interview.

The IMF has described India as a 'bright spot' amid tepid global growth, whereas, the World Bank has acknowledged its resilience amid the current global headwinds. Do you see this translating into India emerging as one of the biggest investment hubs?

In recent years, the global economy has been struggling with multiple challenges, including Covid-19, high inflation, and the Russia-Ukraine war. In contrast, the IMF‚Äôs GDP growth forecast for India for 2023 is 6.1%, and there could be a potential upside to these numbers as the first quarter FY24 growth rate was a robust 7.8%. The IMF also expects that India will become the third-largest economy by 2027-28, based on current projections. This is a conducive environment for India as an attractive destination for global investments, and it is reflected in robust inflows from global investors (both FPI and FDI) and elevated valuations for public markets in India.

The growth forecasts are buttressed by capital spending on infrastructure, with the central government‚Äôs capex increasing from 12% of total expenditure in 2017-18 to 22% in 2023-24, which can potentially crowd-in private investments. The government has also rolled out subsidies to take advantage of shifting global supply chains. Despite this thrust in manufacturing, it is notable that the services sector, particularly financial services, banking, and insurance, continues to be a major source of foreign direct investments (16%), ahead of computer software and hardware (15%), and telecom (6%) in 2022-23.

In the APAC region, has India embarked on the journey to become more economically vibrant than China? If yes, what are the key reasons driving the change?

When it comes to growth, India has benefited from a few tailwinds. The supply chain shifts driven by the pandemic and geopolitical considerations have benefited many countries in APAC, including India. As a major exporter of agri-commodities, India escaped the worst of double-digit inflation that plagued the rest of the world. Since the pandemic, large domestic demand and increasing capital spending on productive assets have added resilience to the economy and helped the rupee outperform most of the APAC markets post-pandemic.

There are other enabling factors too. India is focusing on building world class infrastructure in the areas such as roads, airports, ports, and real estate to address gaps that have long held back its economy. For example, India had about 145,000 kilometres of national highways at the close of the FY23, almost double the more than ~78,000 kilometres it had a decade earlier. The country is also a rich source of talent in data science and new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence driven innovation. For example, most tech companies have huge developments centres in India and India is also the top country among H1B visa holders and most of these are STEM graduates and professionals.

Large-scale global demographic trends will also alter societal structures and capital markets. Over the next 5‚Äì10 years, we expect the transitions with global population shifts as negative replacement rates are the norm for Western Europe, China, Japan, and other mature markets where aging populations strain retirement systems and social safety nets. India has already surpassed China as the world‚Äôs most populous country and, is favourably placed demographically vis-√†-vis most markets.

India has drawn applause for making UPI an instrument of mass usage. Do you see others in APAC replicating India's move to use technology for financial inclusion? Also, do you think APAC countries could be seeking New Delhi's aid or collaboration for an India Stack-like model?

UPI has been a remarkable innovation and a great example of digital adoption at a mass scale. There are also other important initiatives, such as e-KYC, which was a key factor in reducing banks' costs of onboarding customers. In this context, the low cost of data, and a thriving venture capital industry that took advantage of the resulting vast consumer base, are important enablers.

However, the main enabler of digital adoption is trust. APAC in general, and India in particular, are enthusiastic adopters of digital finance. In our recent survey on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), another digital finance innovation, the level of support for CBDCs among our Indian members was 66%, behind only China (70%), among all the markets surveyed.

Regardless of the trajectory of this innovation, there are huge opportunities for regional integration in payment systems, with the attendant efficiencies in cross-border payments. For example, Singapore‚Äôs PayNow has now been integrated with India‚Äôs UPI, with efforts underway in a few other markets.

While India has led in the digital transformation journey over the past decade, do you think the country's is well-positioned to benefit from the advancements in artificial intelligence?

India has made significant progress on various large-scale and diverse initiatives on its journey towards digital transformation. While it is natural to extrapolate this success to encompass AI, there are important caveats. Leadership in AI depends on access to hardware (advanced semiconductors), and vast amounts of high-quality data to train AI models.

India has taken initial steps to develop a home-grown semiconductor ecosystem, but a skilled workforce and large, sustained investments are critical to benefiting from the advancements in AI. Lastly, India‚Äôs digital transformation has led to vast, uniquely identifiable data on financial transactions and other data for training AI models in various settings.

Do you think India's net-zero goals are well-aligned with its growth vision? How do you compare it to other economies in APAC region?

India‚Äôs overall target to achieve net zero by 2070 reflects its development needs. India‚Äôs other climate goals, which include 500 GW of renewable-based power generation capacity by 2030, are aggressive.

Among some major APAC markets, China and Indonesia are aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2060, Malaysia and Singapore by 2050, while the Philippines is the only major APAC market that has not committed to a net zero target. In general, while target-setting is important, implementation is equally, if not more, important. While public policy and spending will continue to drive much of the progress toward net zero, as government debt rises across the world, private capital also needs to play a significant role. The need is for blended finance models that combine private capital with public capital or guarantees can play a significant role in catalysing the finance needed for transitioning into a low-carbon economy.

In its Economic Outlook for Asia Pacific Q4 2023 report, S&P said, ‚ÄúGrowth this year will be weaker than in 2022, but our outlook remains broadly favourable. Notwithstanding the strong expansion in India in the June quarter, we maintain our forecast for fiscal 2024 (ending March 2024), given the slowing world economy, the delayed effect of rate hikes, and the rising risk of subnormal monsoons.""

For the financial year 2022-23, India's growth rate came in at 7.2 percent, higher than the RBI's estimate of 7 percent. However, the pace of growth was slower as compared to the 9.1 percent recorded in FY22.

Coming back to S&P, the rating agency retained its growth forecast for the current fiscal at 6 percent, S&P also maintained that India's economy will grow 6.9 percent in both 2024-25 and 2025-26 fiscal years. Moreover, it added that India's consumption growth as well as capital expenditure remained ""strong"" in the June quarter.

With regard to growth in the Asia Pacific region, S&P said it remains a ""multi-speed region"" and slightly raised its forecast for 2023 to 3.9 per cent amid domestic resilience.

""In all, growth in the region has generally remained resilient. Year-on-year GDP growth picked up in the second quarter in both developed and emerging Asian economies. India led again, with GDP growing 4.2 per cent quarter on quarter to a level 7.8 per cent up on a year ago,"" S&P said.

Earlier on 20 September, India Ratings and Research revised India's GDP growth estimate for FY24 to 6.2 percent from 5.9 percent projected earlier, citing sustained government capex, deleveraged balance sheet of corporates and banking sector, and the prospect of a new private corporate capex cycle. It, however, cautioned that the Indian economy faces challenges from slowing exports, which contracted during the April-July period amid global headwinds and deficient monsoon.

US West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) futures rose 40 cents, or 0.5 per cent, to $90.03 a barrel, as US oil rig counts fell. The benchmark fell 0.03 per cent for the week, the first decline in four weeks.

Oil prices are expected to trade higher and can touch above $95, but market analysts reckon that prices sustaining above $100 is questionable. ‚Äò‚ÄôMarkets fear that this trend could spur more cooling in the US economy, potentially denting crude demand,'' said domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal.

US fuel demand is also expected to cool in the coming months, with the end of the travel-heavy summer season. Biden administration is keen to keep pump prices in check ahead of the presidential election next year, where inflation and fuel costs have already become areas of attack for Republican party, according to the brokerage firm.

Earlier this month, oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia extended their voluntary oil output cuts of a combined 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) to the end of December 2023. These are on top of the April cuts agreed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) running to the end of 2024.



Oil above $100/bbl-mark unlikely: What's weighing on crude prices?

-Even though higher oil prices would help Saudi Arabia balance its budget and Russia fund its war machine, triple-digit oil prices could cause US shale producers to increase their supply to lower prices. Also, higher prices could drive more investment into clean energy.

-The total US crude oil inventories, including the Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR), just fell below 800 million barrels. Refilling the SPR would involve either buying expensive oil or a large drop in oil prices. Both of which are unlikely to occur anytime soon, according to analysts.

-US Federal Reserve officials warned of further rate hikes, even after voting to hold the benchmark federal funds rate steady at a meeting this week. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs, which could slow economic growth and reduce oil demand.

-The world oil inventories, having depleted sharply this quarter, are set for an even steeper drop of roughly 3.3 million barrels per day (mbpd) in the next three months. This could be biggest inventory drawdown since at least 2007.

-Russia temporarily banned exports of gasoline and diesel to all countries outside a circle of four ex-Soviet states with immediate effect in order to stabilize the domestic fuel market, the Russian government said last week.



-Even after doubting oil price sustainability above $100-mark, brokerages and market analysts still do not completely rule out the possibility. ‚Äò‚ÄôAny surprise cut by OPEC+ once again can bring further positive momentum and push prices higher above $100,'' said Motilal Oswal.



How does crude oil price movement impact Indian economy?

-India fulfills as much as 85 per cent of its energy needs through imports, may see a heavier import bill if international crude oil prices keep rising throughout the year. Heavier crude rates pushes the US dollar above against its peers, which in turn, is a downside for the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar can weigh on oil demand by making the fuel more expensive for holders of other currencies.

-High crude prices are said to have a domino effect on the economy, as the price shocks are instantly passed on to the macroeconomic indicators. Current account deficit (CAD) is a key indicator of the balance of payment of a country and in the current scenario of the momentum picked up by crude rates, every $10 dollar rise in Brent futures potentially widens the CAD by 0.5 per cent.

-Surprise changes in oil prices can also influence the price and wage-setting in the economy by altering the inflation expectations of firms and households, and so, domestic economic activity falls on impact of such a shock.

-The sustained increase in prices may lead to a lower aggregate demand as households and firms are left with less disposable incomes to spend on non-energy goods. This is how domestic consumer prices respond to an oil supply news shock.

-Analysts observe that a sharp increase in crude oil prices disrupts India's balance of trade, making it more vulnerable as a net oil importer. ‚Äò‚ÄôThis heavy reliance on oil imports has driven up energy costs, putting pressure on the stability of the Indian rupee,'' said Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President, Master Capital Services Ltd. The combination of higher living costs and a depreciating currency is discouraging both domestic and foreign investments.

87,mint,In charts: Big shifts in India‚Äôs jobs market in last 40 years,https://www.livemint.com/economy/how-indias-jobs-market-has-shifted-for-better-and-for-worse-11695538910989.html,25 Sep 2023,,"Solving the problem of joblessness has been a daunting matter for successive governments. In the past 40 years, economic growth has aided a structural shift away from agricultural jobs, but it hasn‚Äôt necessarily led to a proportionate growth in the workforce. Disparities have reduced, but not enough. On the bright side, more families are now in better jobs than their previous generations, showing greater upward mobility, a key indicator of progress. These are the findings of the latest State of Working India (SWI) report, released last week by the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University.

1. Jobless growth?

India has grown impressively in the past 25 years but views are divided on whether this has created enough new jobs and uplifted people, especially those from marginalized groups, to a satisfactory level. The SWI report analyzed respondent-level data from various government surveys since the 1980s‚Äîincluding the erstwhile Employment and Unemployment Surveys, the Periodic Labour Force Surveys, and the National Family Health Surveys‚Äîto map the changes in the jobs market in this period. It found that in the non-farm sector, the link between the GDP growth and the pace of job creation has weakened over time. With the exception of the period 2017-2021, the rise in employment in past periods lagged the pace of growth, suggesting that policies aimed to achieve faster GDP growth ‚Äúwill not necessarily speed up job creation"", the report noted. (The change of trend in 2017-2021 could partly be explained by a move to self-employment in distress during the pandemic.)

2. Structural shifts

Nevertheless, economic prosperity has drawn millions of workers out of agriculture since the 1980s and the share of salaried and regular-wage workers has risen. The shift from the agricultural sector has been to construction the most, while the manufacturing sector has failed to make any significant gains. Ideally a shift from agriculture to higher value-addition sectors such as manufacturing or modern services would have yielded better results, but India has proved to be a ‚Äústrong outlier when it comes to the share of the workforce engaged in construction"", the report said. The construction sector became the main source of casual workers across caste groups, but it worked differently along gender lines. For men, an exit from agriculture meant a large increase in the share of construction, while for women it meant an exit from the workforce, the report said. The decline in India‚Äôs female labour force participation rate over the years despite its economic growth has been well-documented.

3. Deep divides

Despite the decline, there has been a ‚Äúdramatic change"" in the composition of the female workforce. Older, less-educated women working in agriculture have exited the labour force, and younger and more-educated women are making an entry. At the same time, growth created regular-wage jobs for all caste groups but at very different rates. The pay divide remains deep across gender, caste and religion. The gap was acute for those from scheduled castes and tribes (SC/ST) compared to the rest of the population: they earned just 67% of what dominant communities earned in 2021-22. Women in these marginalized communities earned 54% of what other women earned. For women overall, the pay ratio with men improved from 70% in 2004, but only to 76% in recent years. The scenario is worse for self-employed women, where the ratio was 40%. The divide is narrower (79%) for Muslims and those from other backward classes.

4. Pandemic paradox

When the covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns brought the economy to a halt, workers were forced to rely on agriculture or on self-employment in order to survive. As a result, the share of employment accounted for by these two sectors rose sharply in the lockdown quarter (April-June 2020). This also led to a rise in female employment, which had been either falling (rural) or had been stagnant (urban) since 2004, due to the distress-led increase in self-employment, the report observed. From about 50% in April-June 2019, the share of self-employed male workers increased to 58.2% in April-June 2020 but began coming down after that. For female workers, it rose from the same level to 57.8% but increased further to 61% in April-June 2022. While the last few years saw more formal salaried jobs, women were compelled to enter self-employment due to distress caused by the growth slowdown and the pandemic, the report noted.

5. The gains and the pains

Overall, India did take a leap in creating more regular jobs, up to 5 million per year between 2017 and 2019 from about 3 million per year between 2004 and 2017, with the share of salaried workers rising to 25% by 2018, the report said. However, since 2019, the pace of regular-wage jobs creation has decreased due to the growth slowdown. Moreover, for graduates below the age of 25, the jobs market had little to offer, with 42.3% being unemployed. Women were often limited by societal norms. In urban areas, those with husbands who earned more were less likely to be employed, although it was only till a threshold: the likelihood of being employed rises once the husband‚Äôs salary crosses ‚Çπ40,000 per month, the analysis found. For women with unemployed mothers-in-law present in the same home, the likelihood of being employed was lower by 20% (rural) and 30% (urban), compared to households where no mother-in-law is present."

In a recently published report titled 'Time to Decide', the World Bank argues that Pakistan needs urgent economic reforms.

This advice comes amidst alarming indicators like skyrocketing inflation, dwindling foreign exchange reserves and a population where 40% live below the poverty line. And, it has been 75 years since the country got its independence from British rule on August 14, 1947.

Najy Banhassine, the World Bank‚Äôs Country Director for Pakistan, pointed out that the nation's policy decisions are heavily swayed by a coalition of strong vested interests. These include political, military and business elites. According to Banhassine, unless Pakistan changes its course, it risks becoming a perpetual laggard, hamstrung by elite capture and policy decisions that favour a few.

‚ÄúIt is also facing a ‚Äòsilent‚Äô human capital crisis: abnormally high child stunting rates, low learning outcomes, and high child mortality,"" ANI quoted Banhassine as saying.

With economic hardship mounting, the Pakistani Rupee touched a record low against the dollar, sliding to ‚Çπ299.64 in the interbank market. Analysts attribute this to easing import restrictions, which have increased demand for the US dollar. These conditions were stipulated in a $3 billion loan programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The World Bank has stated that Pakistan's real per capita growth rate was a mere 1.7% between 2000 and 2020. This is less than half the average growth rate for South Asian countries over the same period.

Equally troubling is the human development crisis the country faces, particularly high rates of child stunting and poor learning outcomes.

The report highlights that previous successes in poverty reduction until 2018 have been reversed. It urges Pakistan to overhaul its service delivery and social protection systems, particularly targeting the most vulnerable, including children and women.

It also calls for a shift from inefficient and rigid public spending to prioritised investment in public services and climate adaptation.

89,mint,Will long-term rewards of G-Sec inclusion in JPMorgan Index outweigh risks?,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/will-long-term-rewards-of-g-sec-inclusion-in-jpmorgan-index-outweigh-risks-11695388937483.html,22 Sep 2023,,"The range of reactions to JPMorgan‚Äôs decision to include Indian government bonds in its Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) with effect from June 2024 says it all. Predictably, markets are elated, policy makers, circumspect.

This is not surprising. Markets are not known to look beyond the immediate. Hence, the prospect of additional inflows into the government securities (G-Sec) market by investors based on the GBI-EM is enough to make markets swoon. Soon after JPMorgan‚Äôs announcement, the Indian rupee and 10-year bond prices jumped. The domestic currency opened at 82.83 against the US dollar, rising from its previous close of 83.09, and ended the day at 83.26. The 10-year bond yield fell 6 basis points to hit a two-month low of 7.101% from its previous close of 7.163 % only to close at 7.156%.

‚ÄòIrrational exuberance‚Äô? Remember, one of the biggest strengths of the Indian economy so far has been the limited exposure of our bond market to overseas investors. If the experience of the SE Asian crisis, and prior to that, the Latin American crisis, has taught us anything, it is that excessive exposure of local debt markets to fickle overseas investors and markets can bring the entire economy to its knees.

Apart from the fact that access to a larger pool of funds could prove a temptation to governments in search of easy money, large inflows and outflows linked to developments overseas can have an outsized impact on our relatively shallow and one-sided domestic bond and currency markets. Even if the debt is rupee-denominated, repayment requires externalisation or conversion of local currency into foreign currency, typically US dollars. Given thin trade in forex markets, additional safeguards will have to be put in place to minimise volatility in forex markets that could destabilise the economy.

Remember, high foreign holding of debt exposes Indian markets not only to external macro-economic shocks but also to geo-political risks. The recent experience of how Russia was ousted from international currency markets and the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) is a cautionary tale of how geopolitics can impact financial flows and hence economic well-being.

This is why the Reserve Bank of India, (RBI) has all along, rightly, been less gung-ho about inclusion in the bond index, despite relentless pressure from foreign brokerages over the past few years. To the credit of the government, it has not capitulated on tax concessions sought by these brokerages as a precursor to India‚Äôs inclusion in the bond index and, interestingly, JPMorgan‚Äôs decision has come without government ceding ground on its sovereign right on taxation issues.

Remember, it is only G-secs that have been included in JP Morgan‚Äôs index, so, to assume there will be an increase in inflows and demand for Indian bonds and hence Indian corporates will be able to get money cheap is somewhat na√Øve. The problems of the corporate bond market in India go beyond easier access to overseas funding as seen by the limited investment by overseas investors in corporate bonds despite RBI allowing foreigners to invest. Unlike investment in G-Secs, the limit for investment in corporate bonds has never been reached.

Remember it is not so long ago that our equity markets were at the mercy of the ups and downs in India‚Äôs weightage in the MSCI (Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets) index. Today, due to the large presence of domestic investors in our equity markets (thanks in large part to investments through the SIP or Systematic Investment Plan route) that is no longer the case.

Consider what could happen if rating agencies decide for any extraneous reason to downgrade us. Institutional investors who invest in India based on our share in the bond index will immediately turn tail and exit without a second thought.

With JP Morgan taking the plunge, presumably, it is only a matter of time before India gets included in all three bond indices ‚Äì JPMorgan EM index, FTSE EM index, and the Bloomberg Barclays EM bond index. But as with capital account convertibility, whose merits were long touted by none less than the International Monetary Fund, before it recanted in recent years, inclusion in the bond index comes with both risks and rewards. It is not clear that at our present stage of development, the rewards outweigh the risks. We need to be watchful. Our motto: ‚ÄòCross the river by touching the stones‚Äô, an old Chinese saying that held that country in good stead during its reform process.

90,mint,Indian economy to grow at 6.5% real GDP for FY24: Finance Ministry,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-economy-to-grow-at-6-5-real-gdp-for-fy24-finance-ministry-11695385907284.html,22 Sep 2023,,"The Union Ministry of Finance on 22 September released the Monthly Economic Review for August 2023, stating to remain comfortable with a 6.5 percent real GDP growth estimate for FY24 with symmetric risks.

The report mentioned the estimates of national income released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) show real GDP growing at 7.8 percent in Q1 of FY24.

Citing strong domestic demand for consumption and investment, the ministry said these led to the growth in Q1 of FY24. The government also said that improved corporate profitability, private capital formation, and bank credit growth led to the desired results.

The 7.8 percent growth recorded in the first quarter (April-June) was witnessed in various high-frequency indicators.

The review, while flagging certain risks like steadily climbing crude oil prices in the global market and, the impact of the monsoon deficit in August on Kharif and Rabi crops, said, ""That needs to be assessed."" Though the ministry noted the rains in September have erased a portion of the rainfall deficit at the end of August.

""In sum, we remain comfortable with our 6.5 percent real GDP growth estimate for FY24 with symmetric risks,"" it said.

The report said that as strengthening consumption led to a rise in demand for goods and services, both the manufacturing and the services sectors saw their output and value-added grow robustly in Q1 of FY24. It added that the strength of domestic investment is the result of the government‚Äôs continued emphasis on capital expenditure and the measures implemented by the Union government have also incentivised States to increase their capex spending.

As services exports have performed well, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth has increased in Q1 of FY24, said the report, adding, ""HFIs for July/August 2023 reflects the sustenance of growth momentum in Q2 of FY24.""

Banking sector:

In the banking sector, the report said that a variety of indicators suggest increasing resilience of the sector through declining Non-Performing Assets (NPA), improving Capital Risk-weighted Asset Ratio (CRAR), rising Return on Assets (RoA), and Return on Equity (RoE) as of March 2023.

While data for Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) indicated improvements in their profitability and risk-taking behavior. It cited the RBI estimates of July 2023 where consistent and broad-based growth in the non-food bank credit of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) since April 2022 was shown.

‚ÄúRobust health of the banking system can be attributed to the deleveraging process undertaken by the corporate sector over the previous decade,"" the report said, adding that the growth momentum for the private non-financial companies continued from the last quarter of FY23 into the first quarter of FY24.

The Ministry report even said that the restructuring of the balance sheet has placed the companies in a sound position to expand their investment and become more resilient to economic shocks. It added that the healthy performance of the corporate sector has vindicated and strengthened investors‚Äô confidence in the Indian growth story.

Inflation:

Stating that the calibrated measures taken by the government helped to reduce core inflation to a 40-month low level, the report said retail inflation decreased in August, with both core inflation and food inflation easing from the July figure. The consumer food price inflation eased to 9.9 percent in August.

Risks Remain:

Despite showing confidence in attaining a 6.5 percent real GDP growth estimate for FY24, the report cited risks including climbing crude oil prices, monsoon deficit in August, and stock market correction. ‚ÄúOffsetting these risks are the bright spots of corporate profitability, private sector capital formation, bank credit growth, and activity in the construction sector,"" said the report.

The German brokerage said the Indian rupee is trading close to around ‚Çπ83.30, its all-time high against the US dollar, and the Reserve Bank is actively intervening in the forex market to curtail volatilities.

""...the RBI can easily spend at least USD 30 billion to defend the rupee, and even then, the import cover will remain around 10 months,"" the brokerage said in its report.

The Indian rupee rose by 5 paise to close at 83.06 against the dollar at the end of the day's trade.

The Deutsche Bank report said on a decline in the vegetable prices, the headline inflation is likely to down sharply to 5% for September, from 6.8% in August. At the same time the brokerage noted the global crude prices have registered a hike $95 a barrel in recent past.

However, the Indian customers are unlikely to feel the impact of global crude prices hike, owing to the upcoming state elections, which will be followed up with general elections, the report said.

The report further said that the Union government in August last week cut prices of domestic cooking gas up to ‚Çπ200 per cylinder, which is likely lead to a 0.25% decline in the consumer price index (CPI). Ideally, a 10% spike in crude prices can otherwise impact consumer price inflation by 0.30%, the report added.

The brokerages kept its FY24 GDP growth outlook to 6.2%, saying that if domestic fuel prices are not raised, then they are unlikely to have any meaningful impact on growth estimates

The brokerage said headline inflation can fall below 4% in July-September 2024 due to the exceptionally favourable base effect, and the RBI may consider a rate cut from April 2024 onwards.

92,mint,Mint Explainer: Why the risk of further rupee depreciation may be overblown,https://www.livemint.com/market/mint-explainer-why-the-risk-of-further-rupee-depreciation-may-be-overblown-11695283275688.html,21 Sep 2023,,"Is it geopolitics or geoeconomics? Over the past few days, several analysts have raised the possibility of a further significant fall in the rupee's exchange rate, currently hovering at ‚Çπ83.13-83.18 to the US dollar. But this must be seen in a broader perspective.

In 2022, the rupee saw an 11% slide, plunging from ‚Çπ74.21 to ‚Çπ82.61 by year's end ‚Äì the most significant drop since 2013. Market experts estimated that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) drew nearly $100 billion from its reserves to bolster the rupee.

Comparable currencies faced similar, if not worse, devaluations. After plummeting to a low of ‚Çπ83.18 per dollar in October last year, the rupee had rebounded to ‚Çπ82.30 by July 2023. The RBI's believes that the rupee's current valuation is consistent with its long-term trajectory.

The steep fall in 2022 was largely attributed to global incidents: the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, successive interest rate hikes initiated by a bullish U.S. Federal Reserve, and the subsequent ripple effect on other central banks. Furthermore, escalating crude oil prices and halted supply chains as economies scaled back on trade openness further destabilized the currency. Add to this mix, the smorgasbord of geopolitical crises across several countries.

But latest economic data prints and government estimates indicate that India‚Äôs economy is strong and resilient. So the underlying question is: what‚Äôs the cause for concern?

What might lead to the rupee's further depreciation?

Crude oil prices in global markets have surged from $78.35 at the end of 2022 to nearly $93.70 as on 16 September. Market experts expect prices to hit $100 due to supply cuts announced by prominent producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia.

Earlier, there were expectations that the US dollar would weaken, which meant the rupee and other currencies would strengthen. The dollar has gotten stronger, and the US economy continues to exhibit great strength, so the risk of the rupee‚Äôs depreciation goes up.

Globally, inflation remains a persistent problem, and central banks have made fighting it their number one priority. There may be high short-term costs in raising interest rates to their highest levels in recent times, but central bankers are determined that inflation is their biggest enemy. Persistent global inflation can be imported, leading to some weakening of the currency.

Market predictions lean towards a 2-2.5% depreciation, suggesting an exchange rate of ‚Çπ83.5 to ‚Çπ84 against the dollar

How will it affect the stock market?

At the beginning of the year, market analysts had estimated a certain amount of foreign direct investment (FDI), approximately $35 billion for the year. There has been a slowdown in private investment and FDI globally, so that amount may not be achieved. The effect will be felt in some degree through the equity markets.

The strengthening of the US dollar has also resulted in a firming of interest rate differentials in favour of the US, which unlike the rest of the world is not affected badly by rising oil prices. The favourability of interest rate differentials is felt in the yields in the bond market which continue to rise everywhere else.

The change in expectations, both on FDI flows and the dollar remaining strong, will likely end up being expressed in the depreciation of the rupee, though not a very large one, as shown previously.

How will it affect the economy?

One evident impact will be on the current account. In recent months, there has been a slowdown in exports, with government curbs on overseas sales of agricultural goods. There has also been a decrease in imports, as is visible from the constraints imposed on the import of computers and personal electronics.

Services exports have been affected by the decline in IT/ITES exports, but that been offset by the increase in other services exports, like management and consulting services, which grew and stabilised in the post-Covid period..

Overall, the maximum projected current account deficit might touch 1.4% of the GDP ‚Äì a manageable rate without a pronounced effect on the exchange rate.

In an interview with Mint, Mohanty shared his views on markets, the economy and the sectors he finds promising.

Edited excerpts:

How should one invest in this market? Most positives, such as economic growth, corporate earnings and the end of interest rate hikes appear discounted already while negatives seem to have refused to fade away.

The process of investment remains the same for most investors. Disciplined asset allocation after proper analysis of risk appetite and time horizon of investment, could deliver results.

India remains stock pickers' delight. The sound analysis will always throw up good stock ideas, irrespective of the global or domestic macro.

There may be some hiccups in the interim, but the India story, as it pans out over the next two to three decades, might surprise everyone positively.

However, investors have to factor in uncertainty and volatility in the markets and should be prepared to hold positions across tough market periods, through appropriate sizing and exposure.

What is your view on the current market cycle? Is it near its end? Do you see the possibility of a bear phase in the market anytime soon?

We believe it is always difficult to call the beginning or end of market cycles. We look at outcomes from a probabilistic perspective.

Today we are in a very unique situation, because the domestic macros look quite promising, but there are headwinds from global macros.

We are extremely cognizant of the macro risks developing globally because of various factors and preparing our portfolios for that.

We do not specifically call the markets a bull or bear to orient our portfolios.

As a process, we continuously evaluate our portfolios and subject our exposures to the value and margin of safety tests.

Our endeavour is to try and discover pockets of value based on our models and orient our portfolios accordingly.

Can rising crude oil prices and a poor monsoon derail Indian economic growth? How could these factors impact the domestic market?

Poor monsoons and rising crude prices, definitely create headwinds for our markets, but I think our buffer food stocks and proactive supply-side management will mitigate the impact.

Also, better irrigation infrastructure in our grain baskets has also reduced the impact of monsoons.

However poor monsoons can impact rural consumption and hence overall demand and growth.

Crude prices are a definite worry, both, from the inflation and the currency perspective and hence is something that needs a close watch.

This, however, will lead to a higher adoption of EVs (electric vehicles) in the country.

From a longer-term perspective, better road infrastructure, intra and intercity, a buildup of mass transit systems in an increasing number of cities, dedicated freight corridors, and ethanol blending will reduce dependency on fossil fuels going forward, which will be a huge blessing for the country.

Are you worried about the impact of the global economic slowdown on India?

Not too much.

There can in all probability be a short-term blip, but the domestic macros are shaping up very well on several fronts and with increasing geopolitical uncertainty globally, India seems to be positioned increasingly as an oasis of calm and growth.

So, India could continue to get an increasing allocation of global capital which will drive multi-decadal growth here.

With the increasing popularity of digital platforms, how has technology impacted the distribution and accessibility of mutual funds in India?

Digital platforms have been a blessing for the distribution/ investor fraternity and for the AMCs. The benefit of these platforms and the fact that they are universally accessible, has meant that the smallest distributor and investor can now access these tools from the remotest part of the country.

This has resulted in a huge democratisation of mutual funds and the growth in AUMs (assets under management) and folios of the industry is a happy outcome of the same. This really paves the way for an increased financialization of household savings going forward and bodes well for the Indian economy.

In fact, at a very granular level, every mobile phone, laptop and tablet, functions as a branch of the mutual fund industry. This is a trend that will gather pace going forward and will ensure more distributors and investors become part of this journey.

What are the main factors driving the growth of the mutual fund industry in India, and how do you see these factors evolving in the near future?

The main factors driving the growth of the mutual fund industry in India are several.

The increased awareness of equity as an asset class, increasing financialisation of household savings and steady move away, albeit slowly from traditional asset classes like real estate, ease of transaction through technology and digital ecosystems, the brilliant role played by our mutual fund distributors in last mile hand holding of retail investors, and last but not least the stellar role played by our regulator, SEBI, in increasing transparency, level of disclosures and through the right regulations, reducing the probability of accidents, both, intentional and unintentional.

What has also helped is the maturing of the industry and more strategies and options, from the very simple to the somewhat complex, are being offered to the investors and they have a lot of choices available based on their risk profile and target asset allocation.

As India matures as an economy, these trends will continue to deepen and broaden in the future, short-term blips notwithstanding.

It is for us as Industry players to show our responsibility and commitment, to drive these trends.

The Chinese economy is in the news for all the wrong reasons. Can China's weakness mean more FPI inflow to the Indian market?

China has its own cycles and deals with them in its own way, sometimes more successfully than others.

While India, has and continues to benefit from the China plus one situation, our belief is that India will be an attractive destination not only from a relative sense but from an absolute sense as well.

India is taking a lot of transformational steps which will ensure that we attract global capital in our own right and not because of the fortunes of another economy.

What could be an ideal portfolio for a two-to-three-year time horizon? Should we trim exposure to equities?

There is no right or wrong answer to this. Ideal portfolio is a concept unique to each and every individual investor, based on her risk appetite, life cycle stage, investible surpluses, etc.

The ideal portfolio is actually one which allows you to sleep well at night across market cycles. We can only advise that proper asset allocation, allowing for drawdowns and volatility and appropriate investment horizons, will hold most investors in good stead.

What sectors are you positive about for the next two to three years?

We are dynamic and data-driven in our sector selection. We prefer to follow earnings growth and cash flows while allocating money among sectors and stocks. As things stand, financials, autos, capital goods and export-oriented manufacturing businesses appear promising over the medium term.

95,mint,India Ratings revises India's FY24 GDP growth estimates to 6.2%,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-ratings-revises-indias-fy24-gdp-growth-estimates-to-62-11695214209374.html,20 Sep 2023,,"New Delhi: India Ratings and Research on Wednesday revised India's GDP growth estimate for FY24 to 6.2% from 5.9% projected earlier, citing sustained government capex, deleveraged balance sheet of corporates and banking sector, and the prospect of a new private corporate capex cycle.

The rating agency, part of the Fitch Group, however, cautioned that the Indian economy faces challenges from slowing exports, which contracted during the April-July period amid global headwinds and deficient monsoon.

""Tighter financial conditions have led to rise in the interest rate/cost of capital, and industrial growth, especially manufacturing growth continues to be tepid,"" the report said.

The Indian economy grew at 7.8% in the first quarter of the current fiscal year on higher government and private capital expenditure, and strong services growth.

‚ÄúAll these risks will continue to weigh and restrict India‚Äôs GDP growth to 6.2% in FY24 (FY23: 7.2%), and the quarterly GDP growth, which came in at 7.8% in 1QFY24, is slated to slow down sequentially in the remaining three quarters of FY24,"" said Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, India Ratings and Research. ‚ÄúWhile the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expecting the same, it estimates the overall FY24 GDP to come in at 6.5%.""

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has forecast Q1FY24 real GDP growth at 7.8% and full-year growth at 6.5%.

India Ratings doesn't expect consumption demand to be broad based during the ongoing fiscal.

According to the agency, private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) is expected to grow 6.9% annually in FY24 compared with a 7.5% expansion in FY23.

""The PFCE growth increased to 6.0% in 1QFY24 after languishing below 3% in 2HFY23. Wage growth is critical for consumption growth,"" it said.

""However, the data shows that the real wage growth of households belonging to the lower income bracket has been negative since 4QFY21 and became marginally positive only 3QFY23,"" it said adding that the real wage growth of households belonging to the upper income bracket rose in the range of 9.5% to 12.7% during 1QFY22 to 4QFY23.

""As a result, the current consumption demand is skewed in favour of the goods and services consumed largely by the households belonging to the upper income bracket,"" it added.

The report also said that private sector‚Äôs greenfield capex barring few sectors has remained slow now for several years.

""Besides capex in crude oil, base metals. power and telecom, broad basing is visible with heightened capex activity across cement, chemicals, textile, healthcare, logistics etc.,"" the report said.

""Although Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra continue to dominate fresh capex sanctions, Odisha is coming up with projects across textile, steel and power sectors,"" it added.

A study published in the RBI August bulletin, titled ‚ÄúPrivate Corporate Investment: Performance and Near-term Outlook"", has said that a new private corporate capex cycle is in the offing and private capex spend could reach a decadal high in FY24.

Recently, S&P Global Market Intelligence had revised its FY24 growth estimates for India to 6.6% from 5.9%, due to buoyant economic growth momentum recorded during Q1FY2024.

96,mint,Over 40% Indian graduates under 25 years remain unemployed: Report,https://www.livemint.com/economy/over-40-indian-graduates-under-25-years-remain-unemployed-report-11695202455628.html,20 Sep 2023,,"Amid the speedy economic growth of India, the unemployment rate among graduates under 25 years of age touched a huge 42 percent post-Covid, compared to higher secondary (21.4 percent), secondary (18.1 percent), middle (15 percent) and others, according to a report published by Azim Premji University.

""Post-Covid the unemployment rate is lower than it was pre-Covid, for all education levels. But it remains above 15% for graduates and more worryingly it touches a huge 42% for graduates under 25 years,"" the report -- STATE OF WORKING INDIA 2023: Social Identities and Labour Market Outcomes -- released by Azim Premji University.

The report mentioned that since 1990s year-on-year non-farm GDP growth and non-farm employment growth were uncorrelated with each other. However, the conception of job creation changed between 2004 and 2019 as it was interrupted by the pandemic which caused larger growth in distress employment.

The unemployment rate falls from over 40 percent for educated youth under 25 years of age to less than 5 percent for graduates who are 35 years and above, indicating that eventually graduates do find jobs. However, the key questions are, what is the nature of jobs they find and do these match their skills and aspirations?

ALSO READ: India‚Äôs unemployment challenge can‚Äôt be tackled by doles as usual

On the issue of female employment, the report states that it rose since 2019 due to a distress-led increase in self-employment. Before Covid, 50% of women were self-employed, but post Covid this rose to 60%. ""Even two years after the 2020 lockdown, self-employment earnings were only 85% of what they were in the April-June 2019 quarter,"" the report said.

Looking at a similar point of view, the report mentioned gender norms continue to be significant for women‚Äôs employment. It said that compared to households with no mother-in-law present, married women living in households where the mother-in-law is present but not employed are 20% (rural) to 30% (urban) less likely to be employed. While, if the mother-in-law is employed herself, daughters-in-law are 50% (rural) to 70% (urban) more likely to be employed.

Caste-based segregation

On this issue, the report stated that Scheduled Caste workers declined rapidly over time in waste-related work and leather-related work, though it has not been eliminated as of 2021-22.

""In the leather industry, the representation index declined sharply to 1.4 in 2021. In waste management and sewerage, over-representation of SCs decreased to 1.6 times in 2011 before increasing slightly again,"" the report said.

Also, the report mentioned that lower-caste entrepreneurs are still rare. The report found that even in the smallest firm sizes, SC and ST owners are under-represented compared to their share in the overall workforce. However, SC and ST owners are barely represented among firms employing more than 20 workers.

97,mint,Can a gloomy Chinese market outlook spur foreign investor interest in India?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/can-a-gloomy-chinese-market-outlook-spur-foreign-investor-interest-in-india-experts-weigh-in-11695037371918.html,18 Sep 2023,,"The Chinese economy is struggling on multiple fronts which could make foreign institutional investors (FIIs) move out of its market and increase their focus to other emerging markets (EMs), including India, experts believe.

The public debt of the world's second-largest economy has been mounting, its property market is in deep distress, its exports are slowing and it has to deal with geopolitical issues too. China's economic outlook is bleak.

Shanghai Composite Index is flat for the year and with the worsening economic situation, there is very little scope for its rise this year.

V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services pointed out that the Shanghai Composite Index is the worst-performing large market if we take the near-term and the long-term views.

""The index is flat not only for the year but for the last 16-year period also. Shanghai composite is now at 3,126, the same level as in March 2007. This is terrible long-term performance,"" said Vijayakumar.

He said the disappointment with China is only increasing and this could perhaps be good for India.

Is China's pain India's gain?

Vijayakumar underscored that with a declining population, a decelerating economy, political tensions with the West and anti-business economic policies, the prospects of the Chinese market look dim. That‚Äôs why FPIs are following an ‚Äòavoid China‚Äô policy.

""This is certainly good for India,"" said Vijayakumar.

""Increasing outflows from China and inflows into India are clear inevitable long-term trends. But in the short run, high valuations in India and rising bond yields in the US will pose challenges to this trend,"" said Vijayakumar.

On similar lines, Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research at StoxBox underscored that the outlook for China is bleak as it is struggling on multiple fronts.

""China is struggling on multiple fronts such as property market slump, a double whammy of slowing economic growth and looming threat of prolonged deflationary pressure, slowing exports due to hardened stance of the western world to de-risk their supply chains, high-leverage in the banking system and weak domestic demand,"" Chowdhury observed.

From India's perspective, Chowdhury believes that there are two broad factors which would work in favour and assist in FPI inflows to India vis-√†-vis China.

""Firstly, in the longer term, nominal GDP growth of 12 per cent looks doable for India and should be reflected in stock market performance. This is likely to be driven by India‚Äôs strong consumption story, rich demographic dividend, healthy balance sheet of corporates and a proactive policy stance at the fiscal and monetary levels,"" said Chowdhury.

""Secondly, the groundwork for attracting long-term investments is on its way at a rapid pace through various measures such as establishing a strong manufacturing eco-system, undertaking reformist structural measures for the economy, improving ease of doing business, and ensuring stable and predictable governance,"" said Chowdhury.

Chowdhury believes that there is a lot of runway for attracting foreign inflows to India going forward, especially considering its strong corporate earnings visibility compared to other emerging economies.

Shrey Jain, Founder and CEO of SAS Online underscored even though August data indicated some stability in manufacturing and related investments, there is no denying that the ongoing decline in property investment remains a significant drag on Chinese economic growth.

Measures like cutting the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) last week sent an interesting signal that there is a sense of urgency to boost growth. Jain said this is not still enough and Beijing may have to introduce more aggressive property easing measures to deliver a real recovery.

""Negative news, low sentiment, and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties are still causing foreign investors to hold back from investing in China. In a recent development at the G-20 summit, an announcement regarding the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) has garnered significant attention. This initiative is being perceived as India's response to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and is expected to enhance foreign portfolio investor (FPI) confidence in the Indian market, potentially encouraging long-term investments,"" said Jain.

The world's second-largest economy has been under severe debt pressure due to huge amounts of investments in infrastructure and a downturn in the property market.

As Manoj Dalmia of Proficient Equities pointed out, about 70 per cent of household wealth in China is aligned towards property. Along with this weak demand, unemployed youth will pose a challenge for sustainable growth.

China's growth forecast ranges between 4.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Dalmia expects further downgrades in analyst ratings for China as the recent policy stimulus from Beijing could not stabilise the economy. He said more measures are required in the property sector as it contributes to about a quarter of the economy.

Dalmia said India has been gaining an upper hand in the last few years compared to other economies considering its good relations with different nations.

""The G20 held recently has given a further boost to all the ties several inflows are to come in semiconductors, new-gen technologies, and infrastructure as it is the fastest growing emerging economy worldwide making it a lucrative investment avenue. This sentiment can pull in FPI inflow in India not only from China but other countries as well,"" said Dalmia.

Abhishek Jain, Head of Research at Arihant Capital said while regulatory issues and geopolitical tensions have contributed to investor apprehension, leading some to shy away from the Chinese market, specific sectors show potential and may be attractive to investors.

Jain said the situation in China might prompt global investors to explore alternatives like Hong Kong or select US companies. This could lead to a shift in allocation from China to these regions. It remains to be seen how this might affect FPI flows and whether it can drive investment inflows into India.

As far as the Indian market is concerned, it has been performing well but upcoming elections are an element of risk.

""Overall, monitoring the dynamics of both the Chinese and Indian markets is crucial, considering the global investment landscape and the evolving geopolitical and economic factors,"" said Jain.

Analysts said that traders would keenly watch the meeting of US Federal Reserve‚Äôs Federal Open Market Committee scheduled this week.

Around 1.30 pm, the November contract of Brent on the Intercontinental Exchange was trading at $94.26 per barrel, 0.35% higher than its previous close. The October contract of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) on the NYMEX was trading at $91.21 a barrel, higher by 0.48% from its previous close.

Ravindra Rao, head of commodity research at Kotak Securities said crude futures witnessed the third consecutive weekly gain as extension of the supply curbs by Saudi Arabia and Russia tightened the oil market outlook.

He also noted that the International Energy Agency (IEA) projected that demand will eclipse supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (mpbd) on average during the second half of the year, while OPEC report showed that global oil markets face a supply shortfall of 3.3 mbpd next quarter, potentially the biggest deficit in more than a decade.

‚ÄúData from China showed that economy gathered pace in August, while odds of a US soft landing remains high, keeping the prices buoyed. Fed policy outlook and western Manufacturing PMIs can be closely watched for the week,"" Rao added.

Rahul Kalantri, vice president, commodities, Mehta Equities Ltd said: ‚ÄúCrude oil prices are showing strength since OPEC+ decided to extend its output cuts until the end of 2023. The U.S. economic data released last week was also better than expected and supported crude oil prices.‚Äú

He further said that the People‚Äôs Bank of China cutting its reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 25 basis points last week to support its economy also aided crude prices. Kalantri said that crude oil prices are expected to remain volatile during the day.

Rising crude prices are significant for India as the country imports around 85% of its energy requirement. On the back of the recent rise in prices, the Centre on Friday increased the windfall tax on the sale of domestic crude oil to ‚Çπ10,000 per tonne, from ‚Çπ6,700 per tonne.

The Indian crude oil basket also has increased in the past three months. In June, it averaged $74.93 per barrel and as on 15 September, it stood at $95.45 per barrel. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived basket comprising of sour grade (Oman & Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent Dated) of crude oil processed in Indian refineries in the ratio of 75.62:24.38.

‚ÄúWhenever opposition parties raise these basic issues, instead of giving answers, the government adopts new tactics and gives new slogans. Slogans like ‚ÄòSelf-reliant India‚Äô, ‚Äò5 trillion economies‚Äô, ‚ÄòNew India 2022‚Äô and ‚ÄòAmritkaal‚Äô were given,"" Hindustan Times quoted Kharge as saying.

Kharge also asked his party leaders to explain to the people that such slogans would not bring progress to the country.

‚ÄúNowadays the government is selling the dream of ‚Äò3rd largest economy‚Äô. The country will not progress through slogans. We have to explain to the public that these are slogans to hide failures. The government thinks that it will hide failures like Himalaya by spending crores of rupees on events and advertisements,"" Kharge added.

After its reconstitution on 20 August, the Congress president at its first meeting of the CWC listed several raging issues, demanded a caste census, and reminded the party of its immediate challenge‚Äì the upcoming assembly and Lok Sabha elections.

At the same time, Kharge also questioned the BJP‚Äôs exuberance over the G20 Summit and said: ‚ÄúWe all are seeing how the government is engrossed in its praise after the G20 event. ‚Çπ4,000 crore was spent in Delhi on the G20 meeting to be held by rotation and now Brazil has got the leadership of G20 in rotation.""

Kharge pointed out that from 1953 itself, India‚Äôs status in the world began to develop while quoting India‚Äôs first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru‚Äôs speech ‚ÄúAlthough we neither have any great military power nor any good economic or financial power, yet the respect of this country in the panchayat of nations is increasing day by day. It has been 5 years since independence, but in such a short time, India has gained a lot of respect and along with it new responsibilities have increased. There is hardly any example in history that a country has achieved such importance within five years of independence.""

‚ÄúI hope that the Modi government will stop celebrating and focus on public concerns and burning issues,"" he added.

Kharge further hailed the success of the three meetings conducted by the Opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc, which now consists of 28 parties.

On the issues of Manipur, Kharge said, ""Today the country is facing many serious internal challenges. The whole world witnessed the heart-wrenching incidents in Manipur. Violence continues there even today from 3 May 2023. Modi government allowed the fire in Manipur to reach Nuh in Haryana. Incidents of violence took place here, due to which communal tension spread in Rajasthan, UP, and Delhi.""

‚ÄúThese incidents tarnish the image of modern, progressive, and secular India. In such a situation, the ruling party, communal organizations, and a section of the media add fuel to the fire,"" he said.

Apart from this, he also mentioned about India's economy, inflation, Adani row, and others.

This may blow out India's trade deficit, which is already at threatening levels on soaring crude oil prices.

As per the provisional numbers of India's gold imports in India in August 2023, a person familiary with the developments said on the condition of annynimity that India's gold imports grew to $4.9 billion, which stood at $3.5 billion in August 2022.

Indian goverment is set to announce overall trade deficit data on September 15, 2023 i.e. on Friday this week. According to Bloomberg survey of economists, India's trade deficit is expected at $21 billion . A trade ministry spokesperson said August trade data is still being compiled and it would be premature to comment on the figures, while a Finance Ministry spokesperson couldn‚Äôt be reached on the mobile for comment.

Gold purchases usually pick up in the second half of the year during festivals, which culminate with Diwali in October or November, weddings and as an auspicious investment. An expected rise in purchases during the festive months could help pare a drop in this year‚Äôs consumption, hit by elevated local prices and a slowdown in discretionary spending.

The value of gold imports also jumped during August partly because of a rise of 12% in overseas spot prices in the past year and a lower base in 2022 when imports slumped 30%.

Overall, demand in the South Asian nation is forecast to drop this year to 650 tons to 750 tons, the lowest since the coronavirus pandemic hit the country in 2020, the World Gold Council said in August. India imports almost all the gold it uses mainly from Switzerland.

The Commerce Ministry also compiles gold trade data, which may differ from the Finance Ministry‚Äôs numbers.

G20 Summit: All you need to know about the exotic meals that will be served on magnificent silverware

About 15,000 silverware crafted by 200 artisans have been made for the Heads of State and other world leaders.

The grand meals, which will be served on bespoke silverware are inspired by the cultural heritage of India, a Jaipur-based metalware firm has said.

Iris Jaipur on Tuesday held a preview of some of its silverware in New Delhi.

Most tableware has a steel or brass base or a mix of both with an elegant coating of silver, while some wares like plates that will carry glasses to be used for serving welcome drinks have gold plating.

Rajeev Pabuwal and his son Laksh Pabhuwal run the metalware firm.

While Saudi Arabia has cut oil supply to the tune of 1 million barrels per day (bpd), Russia has restricted the output by 300,000 bpd. These are on top of the April cut agreed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) running to the end of 2024.

After the announcements, Brent crude futures rose by $1.04, or 1.2 per cent, to settle at $90.04 a barrel on Tuesday, closing above the $90 mark for the first time since November 16, 2022. US WTI futures had gained $1.14, or 1.3 per cent, to settle at $86.69 a barrel, also a 10-month high.

Investors had expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend voluntary cuts into October, but the three-month extension was unexpected. Today, OPEC nations produce around 30 per cent of the world's crude oil. Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producer within the cartel, producing more than 10 million barrels a day.

OPEC+ pumps around 40 per cent of the world's crude and its policy decisions can have a major impact on oil prices. High global oil prices could impact emerging economies such as India - a country largely dependent on imports to fulfill its energy needs.

How will high crude oil prices impact the Indian economy?



The economic impact of global oil supply have important implications for India ‚Äì a net importer of crude oil ‚Äì to deliver price stability. Moreover, the oil supply-related news shocks cause a sustained increase in consumer prices and reduce the domestic output - for a short duration.



1.High import bill

India - a net importer of crude oil which fulfills as much as 85 per cent of its energy needs through imports, may see a heavier import bill if international crude oil prices keep rising throughout the year. India produced a total of 2.50 million metric tonnes (MMT) of crude oil in July 2023 - registering a growth of 2.1 per cent compared to the year-ago period, according to Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC).

Crude oil imports decreased by 6.3 per cent and 2.4 per cent during June 2023 and April-July 2023 respectively, compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The net import bill for oil and gas was $9.8 billion in July 2023 compared to $15.8 billion in July 2022, according to PPAC.

2. High petrol, diesel prices

Oil marketing companies (OMCs) including Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) may be forced to lift the freeze on petrol and diesel prices on rising international crude prices.

OMCs did not significantly increase the retail prices last year even after crude reached a peak of $140 per barrel in March 2022. Due to this, the oil refiners registered losses as petrol and diesel rates have been unchanged since April 2022.

However the central government can force OMCs to cut petrol and diesel prices as their balance sheets have largely got repaired due to stronger profits in the current fiscal. Domestic brokerage firm JM Financials expects the government to cut petrol and diesel prices around Diwali as state elections begin in November-December 2023.

‚ÄúOPEC+ is ramping up petrol price pain, triggering fresh and increasing concerns about rising global inflation - which was just beginning to ease - meaning central banks could possibly push higher-for-longer interest rates,'' said Nigel Green, CEO, deVere Group, UAE.

‚ÄúRestricted oil supply leads to higher oil prices, which, in turn, can contribute to higher fuel prices for consumers and businesses, putting upward pressure on the overall inflation,'' added Green.

3.Depreciation of Indian Currency

High oil prices pushes the US dollar above against its peers, which in turn, is a downside for the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar can weigh on oil demand by making the fuel more expensive for holders of other currencies.

The Indian rupee depreciated 14 paise to hit a 10-month low level against the US dollar on Wednesday tracking losses in Asian peers and a sharp surge in crude oil prices. The Indian currency fell to 83.18 to the US dollar as against its previous close of 83.04. Rupee opened at 82.02 a dollar.

""The rupee faced weakness, declining by ‚Çπ0.07 to 83.13, primarily due to a rally in the dollar index, which surged above 104.50$. Additionally, the sustained rally in WTI crude oil prices, holding above 85$, contributed to the rupee's decline,'' said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities.

In recent sessions, the rupee's weakness seems to be factoring in the possibility of another rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. While recent economic data in US has been supportive of the Fed keeping rates unchanged, analysts reckon that the persistent pressure from inflation may push the Fed and other central banks towards considering further rate hikes.

‚Äò‚ÄôAs a result of these factors, the rupee's trading range has shifted lower and can now be expected to fall within the 82.90-83.30 range,'' added Trivedi.



4.High fiscal deficit

Higher crude oil prices will increase the subsidy burden for the central government. The government bears the difference between the market price and the controlled price of oil and gas end-products such as kerosene, diesel, liquified petroleum gas (LPG). This is likely to widen the fiscal deficit - expressed as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).

As per recent official data, the government's fiscal deficit, or the gap between spending and receipts met through borrowings, crossed ‚Çπ6 trillion, or a third of the ‚Çπ17.9 trillion estimated in the union budget for FY24.

Currently, the fiscal deficit stands at 33.9 per cent of the full year target, aided by strong tax and non-tax revenue receipts. Overall revenue receipts in the first four months of this fiscal stood at ‚Çπ7.6 trillion or 29 per cent of the full year target.



5.India's balance of trade

Rising crude oil prices will increase India's dependence on foreign exchange reserves and external borrowing in order to finance its oil imports. This is likely to expose the Indian economy to currency fluctuations and financial shocks that arise from the impact of high crude prices.

A stronger US dollar and rising US bond yields makes the Indian currency weaker, which impacts the trade deals in commodity baskets. The weaker currency suffers losses in such deals as foreign investors pull away their money during price shocks. Higher crude oil prices will also affect the country's trade balance and terms of trade with other countries.



6.Inflationnary Pressures

The oil supply cuts could worsen the current account deficit by around 0.4 per cent of the GDP. The high retail prices of petrol and diesel would further lead to rise in the price of domestic commodities as well.

The sustained increase in prices is expected to lead to a lower aggregate demand as households and firms are left with less disposable incomes to spend on non-energy goods. This is how domestic consumer prices respond to an oil supply news shock.

Surprise changes in oil prices can also influence the price and wage-setting in the economy by altering the inflation expectations of firms and households, and so, domestic economic activity falls on impact of such a shock. However, the impact is felt only for a short duration as it reverts to mean quickly, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).



7.Lower Economic Growth

Higher crude oil prices will increase the cost of production and transportation for various sectors, affecting their profitability and competitiveness. This will reduce the disposable income of consumers, affecting their demand for goods and services.

Analysts say that consumer behaviour plays a critical role because when fuel prices rise, consumers may cut back on discretionary spending, which can impact economic activity. Reduced consumer spending influences the inflation dynamics, especially in sectors heavily dependent on consumer demand.

India is the fourth-largest global energy consumer behind China, the United States and the European Union.

Higher inflation and lower economic activity will impact the monetary policy. ‚Äò‚ÄôAs rising oil prices are expected to have a sustained impact on inflation, central banks can be expected to maintain higher interest rates for longer to control soaring prices,'' said Nigel Green of deVere Group, UAE.

‚ÄúThe decision by the group of oil producing countries will further exacerbate the cost-of-living and cost-of-business crisis as inflation is given another global boost,'' he concluded.

The Nifty large cap index has delivered a 10.9 per cent annualized return over the past 10 years, compared to 6 per cent of the US index and 2.7 per cent of China's market, according to a report by ASK Investment Managers.

In the last five years, Indian markets delivered 18.8 per cent annualized return, compared to 6.9 per cent of US, 12.1 per cent of Japan index, and 7.6 per cent of US index. Additionally, in the last three years, the annualized return of Indian markets stood at 6.1 per cent, higher than US, UK indices, and only slightly lower than 6.3 per cent mark of Indonesia market.

‚Äò‚ÄôDespite challenges, India is strongly poised to build on its strong structural and macroeconomic fundamentals. The market performance will never be linear, but the foundation for long-term economic growth is being built,'' said Sumit Jain, Deputy CIO, ASK Investment Managers.

The current calendar year has been strong for the markets in general, according to the report. While the large cap index (Nifty) is up 6 per cent CYTD, midcap index (BSE Midcap Index) and small cap index (BSE Small Cap Index) are up 23 per cent and 27 per cent respectively.

However, India has not been an outlier. Other countries including Germany, France, Mexico, Japan have delivered higher returns compared to India during the same time frame. Notably, where India differs is on long period returns. On a 3/5/10 years basis India‚Äôs performance has been superior compared to other markets.

Earlier this year, DSP Asset Managers in its Netra June 2023 report titled ‚ÄòEarly Signals Through Charts‚Äô, revealed that over the last 123 years, the Indian stock market has delivered a real return of 6.6 per cent, which is higher than the returns delivered by US and China markets as well as the world equity markets.

This means that India has compounded investors' wealth at 6.6 per cent CAGR or compound annual growth rate, higher than 6.4 per cent CAGR by the United States and 3.3 per cent by China since the year 1900. The CAGR shows real compounding which means it is adjusted for inflation and takes care of currency depreciation that happens over the years because of inflation, according to DSP.



Key factors behind the resilient performance by Indian stock market:

-India‚Äôs long period performance is a function of sound and stable domestic macro-economic scenario, along with high real growth rate. India remains the fastest growing major economy of the world and expected to be the third largest economy by 2027.

-India‚Äôs real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate was over 7 per cent in 2022-23 and expected to remain over 6 per cent in 2023-24. India‚Äôs growth rates are more structural and over period it has managed to reduce the impact of external global macro vagaries on domestic macro.

-Another factor which is playing an important part in India‚Äôs growth is strong demographics. With a relatively young and growing population, India is poised to take a competitive advantage as it would reach the highest working age population that is aspirational, young and with increasing income levels, by 2030.

The first quarter results point to continued strong corporate performance. Nifty posted a profit-after-tax (PAT) growth of over 30 per cent year-on-year (YoY). The oil marketing companies (OMCs) contributed to the major portion of this high PAT growth due to having a benign base of Q1FY23. Nifty (Ex OMCs) with ~19% growth in PAT, also posted strong performance.

-The growth in PAT can be attributed to the fall in input costs aiding in margin expansion across sectors. While the aggregate sales for the top 500 businesses grew 4 per cent, margin expansion driven by benign commodity prices led to superior profit growth during the quarter.

-Sectoral growth was driven by automobiles, oil and gas, insurance, banks and capital goods. Slowdown was more pronounced in globally linked sectors like chemicals, IT, metals, followed by low ticket consumption have been the major pain areas.

105,mint,Charting a realistic path of India‚Äôs growth,https://www.livemint.com/economy/charting-a-realistic-path-of-india-s-growth-11693913790417.html,06 Sep 2023,,"India is considered to be a promising emerging market story. It grew at an average annual pace of 6.6% in the decade to 2019-20. In 2022-23, with a growth rate of 7.2%, India outperformed most other major economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the country will grow by over 6% in the next few years, and is on track to be the world‚Äôs third largest economy. This is creditable, but it is worth remembering that growth rate is the only GDP metric on which India does well. A different, less bullish narrative emerges when we dig deeper into the GDP data, one that gives a more realistic view of economic growth.

1. Purchasing power (dis)parity

India has already been the third largest economy by purchasing power since 2008. Measuring GDP by purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusts for differences in the cost of living across countries. Since goods and services tend to be relatively cheaper in India, Indians enjoy higher purchasing power. So the PPP method pushes India‚Äôs GDP upwards, allowing it to leapfrog other nations on this metric.

In 2022, the top five countries by PPP were China, the US, India, Japan and Russia. In 1990, the US economy was nearly six times that of India, while China was about the same size. Over time, the ratio has shrunk for the US and increased for China‚Äîboth are now less than three times India‚Äôs size. PPP is a magic wand that makes India appear within reach of the world‚Äôs largest economies. But this seeming rise in purchasing power is mainly due to comparatively lower labour costs, rather than relative gains in India‚Äôs income.

2. Silver out of reach

However, without accounting for PPP, the top five economies in dollars in 2022 were the US, China, Germany, Japan and India. By 2027, India is expected to climb to third place, with an estimated GDP of $5.2 trillion. Bagging a bronze in the GDP race will not require an economic boom‚Äîsimply managing a steady 6% real growth, 4% inflation, and annual 2% rupee depreciation will be enough. There is more good news. It took India seven years to grow from $1 trillion to $2 trillion, and another seven to hit $3 trillion, but the next couple of trillions should take three years each, assuming no black swan events derail growth.

However, moving up to second place will be much harder: in 2027, India will be $20.5 trillion behind China. Assuming the same pace of growth, it will take another two decades just to reach where China was in 2027, or the US in 2022.

3. Standard of living

The average standard of living in India‚Äîas measured by per capita output‚Äîis a stark reminder of the yawning gap between India and its emerging market peers. In 2022, India‚Äôs per capita gross national income (GNI) was $2,380, much lower than the other BRICS economies (China: $12,000, Russia: $12,000, Brazil: $8,000, South Africa: $6,780). Using the present yardsticks of the World Bank, India was the last of the BRIC countries to shift from low to middle-income category in 2010.

Growth in India‚Äôs per capita income has been slower and more erratic than comparable economies, which is why it continues to languish near the bottom of the heap. For example, in 1990, China and India were at about the same level, and Vietnam was much worse off. But India has been overtaken by both in the per capita race. China is approaching high-income levels, and Vietnam‚Äôs per capita income is nearly twice that of India.

4. Higher for longer

Many high-income countries started out poor. Their growth path points to the importance of consistent, continuous growth. The original Asian tigers‚ÄîHong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan‚Äîgrew strongly from the 1960s to the 1990s using an export-driven, state-supported growth model. They became role models for the tiger cubs‚ÄîMalaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand‚Äîwhich in turn benefited from the stupendous rise of China. In contrast, India has seen only one continuous stretch of very high growth‚Äîin the early 2000s.

There are no shortcuts to the top. It took 50 years of strong growth for Singapore to transform from a malarial swamp to the world-class city it is today. China delivered double-digit real growth for two decades to become a global power. Each success story is backed by long periods of high growth. The early movers are already in the high-income club; in comparison, India has just started.

5. Convergence clubs

Studies show that countries form ‚Äúconvergence clubs"" with other similar-income nations. Within each club, lower-income countries try to catch up by growing relatively faster. But no country is condemned to remain with the club it started with. Policies can be implemented to achieve the right escape velocity.

In 1980, incomes in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia were comparable. By 2022, the latter had incomes nearly four times higher. European emerging economies have forged ahead of Latin American nations. The common factor in all high achievers is the use of policy intervention and structural reforms to stimulate growth. What about India? On per capita levels, it is in the company of Bangladesh and Laos, whereas it likes to compare itself to the likes of Vietnam and China. If India is to achieve its aspirations, it needs to address underlying obstacles to growth to push itself to a higher-income club.

106,mint,GDP estimates suggest Nirmala Sitharaman has a difficult year ahead,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/gdp-estimates-suggest-nirmala-sitharaman-has-a-difficult-year-ahead-11693811844190.html,04 Sep 2023,,"Gross domestic product (GDP) estimates for the first quarter (April to June) that the National Statistical Office (NSO) released last week have puzzled many commentators. The estimate for year-on-year (yoy) growth in Q1 was 7.8%, lower than Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs ( RBI ) projection of 8%. Several economists were also expecting higher growth. Meanwhile, a few economists pointed out that statistical peculiarities may have inflated NSO‚Äôs growth estimates.

Quarterly estimates are given low weightage in serious analyses. SnapView has explained previously that these estimates are preliminary, and prepared using sparse, rudimentary data. As the year progresses and better-quality information becomes available, the NSO revises them on a schedule.

But at times, even quarterly estimates contain important messages for policymakers. The Q1 estimates have quite a few. The economy remains in recovery mode, with Q1 GDP 13.8% higher than the pre-pandemic level. However, the momentum may not sustain as the year progresses.

The government‚Äôs capex push over the past two years is yet to show up meaningfully in investments or consumption growth, as can be seen from the structure of demand reflecting in the estimates: The shares of consumption and government spending in GDP fell, while that of capital formation didn‚Äôt budge.

Private consumption expenditure grew 6%, slower than overall GDP growth. Capital formation increased about 8%, faster than the rate at which GDP grew, but slower than its average growth rate during the preceding four quarters.

High inflation ‚Äì due to, among other reasons, the RBI‚Äôs failure to act in time and successive food-supply shocks this year ‚Äì appears to have been a drag on consumption demand in Q1. If monsoon rains remain deficient, there will be new risks for inflation and growth.

By shrinking consumers‚Äô purchasing power, high inflation appears to have frustrated the government‚Äôs strategy of providing support to the economy through capex. With inflation projected to remain high, including by RBI, whether consumption will pick up in the coming months is difficult to say. It‚Äôs possible that the successive food-price shocks that followed high inflation over the past couple of years will make households and businesses even more wary of spending, so consumption may not pick up, dampening the private sector‚Äôs enthusiasm for new investments.

Rains in September will affect growth prospects going forward. The agriculture sector grew 3.5% yoy in Q1. Sustaining this rate of growth may be difficult if worries of deficient rainfall materialise, as food production and affordability could be affected, resulting in lower incomes and spending in rural areas. Besides dampening growth, lower food production could also keep inflation elevated if businesses‚Äô and households‚Äô inflation expectations spill over into non-food transactions. This would leave the RBI with no option but to cool prices by sacrificing growth.

Manufacturing sector growth was a disappointing 4.7% in Q1. The drag appears to be due to global central banks cooling demand on exports, which contracted 7.7% after nine consecutive quarters of growth. If interest rates in advanced economies remain high for longer, as the US Federal Reserve has been indicating, they could hamper India‚Äôs GDP growth in the coming months.

Services led overall GDP growth during the Q1, while financial, real estate and professional services grew robustly at 12.2%. Trade, hotels, transport, communication and storage GDP grew 9.2% but in absolute terms remained 2% lower than in Q1 of 2019-20. These employment-intensive services, it seems, haven't recovered fully from the covid shock, which suggests that policy support and relief were insufficient. The low manufacturing-sector growth despite high corporate profit growth also indicates that the unorganised sector‚Äôs performance is likely to have been weak.

Another important message from the GDP estimates is that tax-collection growth could remain tepid through the year, constraining the exchequer‚Äôs ability to provide the economy the support it needs. This signals a difficult year ahead for Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as she prepares the interim budget before Lok Sabha elections in April 2024.

The low nominal GDP growth estimate (8%) indicates tax-revenue growth will be low this year. The impact of the GDP deflator has once again come into play after 15 quarters. Since its estimates are contaminated by rising prices, the NSO deflates them. Its GDP deflator in Q1 was 0.2% yoy, mainly because the wholesale price index-based inflation rate eased. The estimates for nominal growth (8%) and real growth (7.8%) are, therefore, close.

Tax-collections data from the Controller General of Accounts for the first four months of FY24 confirms worries of weak growth. The union government‚Äôs gross tax revenues grew just 2.8%, limiting the government‚Äôs ability to spend over and above the budgeted capex allocations to boost demand. Corporate tax collections contracted 15%. The impact is visible in the Q1 GDP estimates: the government‚Äôs final consumption expenditure contracted by just under 1%.

Weak corporate tax collections despite strong profit margins reported by companies suggest volume growth is sluggish. GST revenues doing well at the same time suggests that the recovery is K-shaped. GST collections could be getting a boost from higher demand for luxury goods, which attract higher tax rates.

Thus, besides GDP growth estimates for manufacturing and select services, the tax data may also be indicating that an appropriate policy response is required to address the K-shaped recovery and arrest the expected slowdown in growth.

However, the government has already exhausted most of its spending power on a capex push that is yet to meaningfully spur consumption or investments. That‚Äôs the challenge Sitharaman will face when preparing the next interim budget."

""A principal source of variability is the monsoon, which is currently 10% deficient, with the country experiencing the driest Aug '23 in over a century,"" the report on the country's Q1FY24 GDP update said.

Inconsistent monsoons could lead to a moderate agriculture GVA growth, and a high chance of El Nino, and improper/ spatial distribution of rainfall could impact crop production, tugging the agriculture sector downwards, SBI Caps said in the report.

""Further, private consumption expenditure‚Äôs share has marginally dipped. The risk here stems from rural consumption,"" it said. ‚ÄúAs lower crop production feeds into lower rural incomes, this could slow down consumption ‚Äì some FMCG majors have already raised such concerns.""

The Indian economy grew 7.8% in the April-June quarter, led by higher government and private capital expenditure and strong services growth, according to government data released on Thursday.

Real GDP at constant (2011-12) prices for the June quarter is estimated to reach ‚Çπ40.37 trillion, marking a 7.8% expansion from ‚Çπ37.44 trillion a year ago, according to the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI). Nominal GDP or GDP at current prices is estimated at ‚Çπ70.67 trillion, reflecting an 8% increase from ‚Çπ65.42 trillion in the year-ago quarter, the ministry said.

The SBI Caps report highlighted that selective growth in specific sub-sectors meant that manufacturing grew by just 4.7% annually during Q1FY24.

""The solid GFCF growth of 8%, which meant it contributed a towering 35% of GDP in Q1, along with growth in select infra-input sectors indicates that the government push for infrastructure building through capex is acting as a driving force for the economy,"" the report said.

""The flipside is that this capex is not crowding in non- government investment, as indicated by tepid bank loan growth to the infrastructure segment, and languid FDI inflows,"" it added.

Going ahead, however, increased social expenditure over the coming quarters, partially to alleviate the rural distress, could increase revenue expenditure, the report said.

""This could stifle the very breath of GDP growth in the past few quarters ‚Äì government capex. Complicating matters further, the Union is also faced with a less than exciting tax collection in 4MFY24, which curtails spending ability,"" it added.

Experts from Moody's highlighted the favourable conditions of robust growth in markets like India and Indonesia in the current year, reported CNBC.

Shadow of slowdown on the global economy

Moody's is expecting global slowdown in growth, Marie Diron, managing director for global sovereign and sub-sovereign risk at Moody's Investors Services told CNBC. She also hinted on the possible impact of global economic slowdown on Asia through trade conditions as well as access to financing in the region.

She also mentioned that the slowdown can be led by three factors, ie higher interest rates by central banks, China's slow growth, and financial system stresses.

She also underlined the persistent threat of inflation despite central banks' raging war against it.

‚ÄúThere are still risks out there that inflation could prove stickier ... than currently expected, and that would lead to higher risks for longer and slower growth,"" the managing director told CNBC.

Talking about India's neighbouring country China, Moody's expert presented a quite grim view of its economic scenario. She said that Moody's is not expecting a major turnaround in the world's second largest economy.

Pockets of resilience

In the current scenario the Global South is emerging as a ray of hope for the world. Validating the statement, Moody's Diron said, ""We see relatively robust growth and favourable conditions in markets like India and Indonesia.""

She underlined Indonesia's ‚Äúvast natural resources"" that can be materialised by Indonesia for its economic growth and the development of downstream sectors through processing of minerals through the value chain.

Meanwhile, India witnessed one of its best performing quarters of the year in April-June quarter in terms of economic growth, says the latest GDP data.

India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.8 per cent in the April-June quarter of current fiscal (2023-2024), against 6.1 per cent in the previous January-March quarter of fiscal 2022-23, as per the official data shared by the National Statistical Office. With this, India continued to be one of the fastest growing major economies of the world. The recent GDP data met experts expectations who projected that the economy recorded the fastest annual pace in a year, driven by the services sector and greater capital expenditure.

While robust domestic demand and manufacturing and services activity likely aided growth in the June quarter, a low-base effect could have helped as well. The statistical effect of a dip in trade deficit and the deflation method used to compute GDP may have bumped up the figures as well.

‚ÄúOverall, this (GDP) is a good number. The fact that nominal GDP growth was 8% and real GDP growth was 7.8% signals that the momentum in economic activity in general is not driven by price-related distortions,"" chief economic adviser V.

He said the July data is showing strong momentum except for merchandise export/non-oil exports. ‚ÄúPrivate sector capital formation is no longer a topic that is waiting to take off, but has taken off,"" he said, adding that private sector capital formation, supported by the government‚Äôs capex push, is underway.

Fresh arrivals of farm produce may cool food inflation, Nageswaran said, pointing to supply-side measures taken by the government while noting the deficient rains in August.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last week that the government expected good GDP growth in Q1. ‚ÄúEnhanced provision for capex by the government is crowding in private investment,"" she said.

However, for some, the 7.8% figure came in below expectations. ‚ÄúAlthough a supportive base propelled India‚Äôs GDP growth to a four-quarter high of 7.8% in Q1 FY24, it nonetheless printed below our expectations of 8.5% as well as the MPC‚Äôs (monetary policy committee) projection of 8%,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist, Icra Ltd.

‚ÄúThe lower-than-expected GVA growth was largely on account of the manufacturing sector, which saw a surprisingly meek uptick to 4.7% in Q1 FY24 from 4.5% in Q4 FY23, despite the improvement in manufacturing volumes, as depicted by the index of industrial production for the same, and deflation in commodity prices. The sharp, broad-based contraction in merchandise exports is likely to have weighed on the performance of manufacturing in Q1 FY24,"" Nayar added.

RBI estimated Q1FY24 real GDP growth at 7.8% and full-year FY24 growth at 6.5%.

Meanwhile, the Centre‚Äôs fiscal deficit for the four months to 31 July stood at ‚Çπ6.6 trillion, accounting for 33.9% of annual estimates. The fiscal deficit in the same period of the previous year stood at ‚Çπ3.41 trillion.

This was largely due to a sharp jump in capex and accelerated tax devolution to the state governments.

Nageswaran said the government‚Äôs schemes, like the production-linked incentives and PM Gati Shakti Mission, will push domestic manufacturing, adding that a slowdown in the global economy could, however, moderate exports. However, he said there is no threat to India‚Äôs macroeconomic stability from external factors.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any threat to the FY24 fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of GDP at this point,"" he said.

Interestingly, the growth of eight key infrastructure sectors rose to 8% in July 2023 compared to 4.8% during the same period of the previous year on the back of an expansion in coal, crude oil, and natural gas production. Steel, cement, and electricity production also grew in July, commerce and industry ministry data showed.

However, core sector growth was lower in July compared to the previous month, when it rose 8.3%. Output growth of the eight sectors was slower at 6.4% in the April-July 2023 period against 11.5% in the year-ago period.

‚ÄúCore sector data shows buoyancy in July with growth of 8% over 4.8% last year. The growth has been buoyant in five of the eight sectors, while steady positive for the other three,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda. ‚ÄúBased on these numbers, the IIP growth rate would be in the range of 5-6% for July,"" Sabnavis added.

‚ÄúContraction in exports after eight quarters of double-digit growth is a concern,"" said Rumki Majumdar, an economist at Deloitte India. ""A global slowdown will likely keep exports down, and the government will be prudent in its spending to ensure it adheres to fiscal consolidation,"" she added."

‚ÄúThere is no real cause for concern that inflation would spike out of control as both the government and the Reserve Bank are taking adequate steps to maintain supply and keep prices under check, reported PTI quoting the chief economic advisor.

Nageswaran said the food inflation is likely to subside with the arrival of fresh stock and government measures. However, he said the impact of deficient rains in August is to be watched.

""There is momentum in economic activity in general and it is not driven by price-related distortions. Therefore our projections still are very comfortably placed at 6.5 per cent for the current financial year,"" Nageswaran said.

Risk is evenly distributed to around 6.5% growth projection for FY2023-24, he said while briefing media following the release of first quarter GDP numbers, he said.

‚ÄúRising crude prices may warrant attention and prolonged geopolitical uncertainty and likely tighter financial conditions can pose risk to growth,"" The chief economic advisor added.

India recorded economic growth of 7.8% in the April-June quarter of 2023-24 against 13.1% in the year-ago period.

With regard to fiscal deficit, Nageswaran said there is no threat to 5.9% fiscal deficit announced in the Budget.

115,mint,Poor monsoon can spike food inflation; can it push RBI to hike rates?,https://www.livemint.com/economy/poor-monsoon-can-spike-food-inflation-can-it-push-rbi-to-hike-rates-experts-weigh-in-11693399312980.html,30 Aug 2023,,"Monsoon this year to expected to remain weak because of the El Nino phenomenon. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) director-general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, El Nino will turn moderate in September and remain strong till December this year.

A couple of days ago, Reuters reported India is poised for its lowest monsoon rains in eight years.

""India is poised for its lowest monsoon rains in eight years, with the El Ni√±o weather pattern seen crimping September precipitation after an August that is on track to be the driest in more than a century,"" Reuters quoted two weather department officials saying so.

The monsoon is critical for India as the country's agri sector significantly depends on monsoon rains. As Reuters pointed out the monsoon delivers nearly 70 per cent of the rain the country needs to water crops and refill reservoirs.

Concerns are growing that as inflation is rising again, a poor monsoon can spoil RBI's efforts to control inflation.

India's consumer price index (CPI) inflation, or retail inflation, surged sharply to a 15-month high peak of 7.44 per cent in July 2023, driven by high food and vegetable prices.

""The elephant in India is the monsoon, with August shortfalls rendering the outlook uncertain in the shadow of El Ni√±o effects even as Indian Ocean dipole conditions are turning positive,'' said RBI's Deputy Governor Dr Michael Debabrata Patra in the latest MPC minutes released on August 24.

The significance of monsoon

More than half of India's population is dependent on agriculture and allied sectors for their livelihood. The agri sector, which contributes roughly around 18 per cent to the national output, is heavily dependent on the monsoon.

As rating agency CARE Ratings points out, ""The monsoon has a far-reaching effect on domestic macroeconomic conditions and directly or indirectly impacts domestic inflation, rural income, consumption demand, trade, and agricultural productivity.""

""Only about 57 per cent of the farm area is covered by irrigation, with large states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu having coverage below the national average. Since over 75 per cent of India‚Äôs annual rainfall occurs between June and September, these four months are crucial for Kharif output and can impact domestic reservoir levels, affecting irrigation-dependent rabi output.""

Poor monsoon to spike inflation

Experts and economists do not appear worried about monsoon's impact on growth but they highlight that it can raise food inflation significantly.

""With agriculture accounting for 15 to 17 per cent of GDP, the impact of monsoon on GDP is rather muted. Our estimate of GDP growth for the year 2023-24 at 6.2 per cent is about 0.3 percentage points lower than the consensus expectation. Consequently, we are not revising our number downwards because of the monsoon effect,"" said Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist and Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Hajra, however, added that the impact of a suboptimal monsoon on inflation can be substantial as food products account for nearly 50 per cent of the retail inflation basket.

""Suboptimal monsoon can result in inflation being 1-1.5 per cent higher than earlier expected for the full year. Supply-sided measures by the government including restrictions on food product exports and import of food products can mitigate part of the upward pressure on inflation,"" said Hajra.

Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist and Head of Research and Outreach at ICRA said if the rains remain below average in the next four weeks, they could lower kharif yields and also affect the area sown under rabi crops. This would infuse caution into rural sentiment ahead of the festive season, dampening the economic growth prospects in the next two to three quarters.

Dipti Deshpande, Principal Economist at CRISIL agrees that a weak monsoon is adding risk to the already-elevated food inflation.

Deshpande underscored that wheat, rice, pulses and coarse cereals have sustained double-digit inflation in recent months. Some hit to production in the previous year, weather anomalies in the current monsoon season and global shortages are all adding upside risks to food prices, said Deshpande, adding that most of these crops that are facing high food inflation are majorly produced in the kharif season between June and October.

""With rains turning deficit at the all-India level and deficit increasing in some of the major kharif-producing states of Jharkhand, Bihar, and Karnataka, sowing for pulses and oilseeds for instance, has taken a hit. All this adds to the inflationary pressures for this fiscal. Rural demand, which is still catching up after the pandemic hit, already faces headwinds from stagnating wages and high food inflation. If weak rains yield a lower output, some dent to agriculture incomes and hence rural demand is inevitable,"" said Deshpande.

In case of a spike in inflation due to poor monsoon, can the RBI go back to hiking rates? Experts do not think so.

""For the near term, we see headline inflation below 6 per cent by October and expect it to average 5.4 per cent in the year, with the second half (H2) of FY24, undershooting RBI's estimates. We do not see any policy urgency in RBI to hike even though they are likely to stay cautious and vigilant,"" said Madhavi Arora, Lead Economist at Emkay Global Financial Services.

Arora believes while perishable inflation will ease materially ahead, led by vegetables mean reversion, and structural uptrends in cereals, pulses and even spices inflation in the food category needs monitoring.

""An adequate and sustainable supply-side response to these will be key to inflation management ahead in an era of weather vagaries and disruption will become more rampant,"" Arora said.

116,mint,Does the 4% inflation target need a reset?,https://www.livemint.com/economy/does-the-4-inflation-target-need-a-reset-11693305266836.html,30 Aug 2023,,"Inflation is back. Just when we thought it was effectively contained within the official upper bound of 6%, the consumer price index (CPI) shot up by 7.4% year-on-year in July 2023. This inflation persistence is quite a letdown, especially when growth is finally showing signs of picking up. But look beyond the headline-grabbing tomato and onion prices, and it is clear that inflation never really went away. The last time inflation was at or below the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs ( RBI ‚Äôs) 4% target was in September 2019.

This problem is not unique to India. Other countries are also struggling to bring inflation down to their target levels. The tenacity of inflation despite more than a year of monetary tightening has led experts to question whether inflation targets need to be raised to better reflect new realities. In the US, for instance, a 3% target instead of the current 2% has been suggested. The same question can be asked about India.

India adopted flexible inflation targeting in 2016, and an inflation target is set every five years. In March 2021, the government retained the target at 4% headline CPI inflation for April 2021-March 2026, with lower and upper tolerance limits of 2% and 6%, respectively. Seeing that inflation has been higher than 6% anyway for more than half the number of months since April 2021, should India adopt a higher official target? This question is best answered by examining the current flexible inflation targeting framework in terms of the target rate, the tolerance band and inflation expectations.

Trend inflation

Trend inflation is the rate to which inflation converges in the long term. In theory, it is the inflation consistent with optimal GDP and stable employment rates. RBI studies have shown that India‚Äôs trend inflation was around 4% in early 2020. But the trend changes over time in response to structural changes in the economy, which is why estimating‚Äîand re-estimating‚Äîtrend inflation is key to effective monetary policy.

If the inflation target is above trend, monetary policy will turn expansionary, creating inflationary conditions. If the target is set below the trend, monetary conditions may be too tight, restricting growth. The aim is to steer the economy towards the Goldilocks trend‚Äîthe ‚Äújust right"" stage. It is too soon to tell if the impact of supply-chain disruptions and the Ukraine war will be transitory. If it is, inflation should return to the pre-pandemic 4% trend, else the new trend level may need a reset of the inflation target in due course.

Finding the threshold

Among emerging economies, India has an unusually large 2% inflation tolerance band on either side of the 4% target. This was adopted for two reasons. One, the high weight of food in the CPI basket increases the volatility. Two, the price of fuel depends on external factors, but impacts CPI significantly. Food and fuel price fluctuations cannot be ignored because they tend to quickly pass into general inflation. A relatively wider tolerance band gives the RBI the flexibility to stay within official limits during periods of volatility.

Households and businesses can usually deal with moderate inflation, but there is a threshold beyond which their budgets get impacted. RBI research shows that India‚Äôs long-term economic growth is impaired when inflation crosses 6%. At a more general level, a comparison of Google search trends for ‚Äúinflation"" against actual inflation trends reveals a higher sensitivity to inflation for thresholds above 6%, suggesting that it may be a sound upper bound for policy action.

The reset moment

A realistic inflation target with the right tolerance limits will keep inflation expectations well-anchored. In other words, long-term expected inflation should not move far from the target. A good way to check this is to look at the RBI‚Äôs bi-monthly survey of professional forecasters. Results show that short-term expectations went up in 2022 as inflation rose, but longer-term expectations were anchored in the 4%-5% range. This is probably a reflection of trust in the RBI‚Äôs ability to manage inflation.

This ‚Äúcredibility bonus"" that the RBI earned during the low inflation years of 2016-2019 is important, because this reputation allows it to target inflation with relatively smaller tightening actions. But to retain its credibility, it is vital that the target be raised, if at all, after inflation has been brought firmly under control. Moving a goalpost because it cannot be reached is a sign of desperation, not wisdom.

The report stated that there is a need for India and China to increase cooperation on issues like river water (Brahmaputra) data sharing, entry of Indian pharmaceutical companies into China, etc.

The decision on expansion of the five-nation grouping was announced by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the end of the three-day BRICS summit in Johannesburg.

With the BRICS deciding to admit six countries as its new members, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said admitting Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as new members will give new energy and direction to the grouping.

The new member nations will become part of BRICS with effect from January 1, 2024.

""India's sweeping acceptance across eco-political spheres globally, its vibrant democratic stature, its success in dynamically steering the G20 Presidentship, the success of Digital Public Goods at population scale, the innovation led tech prowess of its skilled workforce.... ingrains a distinct advantage over both China and Russia as the undisputed intellectual leader of the block,: said SBI report.

China with dwindling exports as also imports losing sheen, and cracks in property markets (Evergrande has lost ~99% of Mcap after trades were resumed after a 17-month hiatus, while debt woes of Country Garden, China's largest developer by sales volume, look like spilling to the wider economy), soaring unemployment rate (believed to be more than double of officially published rates in excess of 21% as youths prefer ‚Äòlying flat‚Äô), waning consumption demand warning from gig platforms market leader Meituan are considerably weighing on the economy and sentiments in general, the report added.

The report stated that strong partnerships among BRICS nations on innovation and digital economy can spur growth, promote transparency, and support sustainable development goals.

As per the report, the trade in the rupee would be more favourable with trade partners such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE, where India is a large importer and potential exists for Indian exports.

Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) permitted 20 banks operating in the country to open 92 Special Rupee Vostro Accounts (SRVAs) of partner banks from 22 countries as part of efforts to promote bilateral trade in local currencies.

""There are a plethora of benefits of trade in rupee with the prominent ones are lowering of transaction costs, a greater degree of price transparency, quick settlement time, promoting international trade, reduction in hedging expenses, reduced cost of holding foreign reserve by the RBI and most importantly, price discovery and internationalisation of the rupee,""the report added.

118,mint,In charts: How economists place India‚Äôs Q1 growth bets,https://www.livemint.com/economy/how-economists-place-india-s-q1-growth-bets-11693222633703.html,29 Aug 2023,,"Despite a worrying slowdown in exports, the Indian economy is likely to have grown at an impressive rate in the June-ended quarter, data for which will be released on Thursday. The growth rate is expected to come around 7.8%, according to the median of the estimates given by 22 economists in a Mint poll. While robust domestic demand and manufacturing and services activity are likely to have aided growth, a low-base effect could also be at play. The statistical effect of a dip in trade deficit and the deflation method used to compute GDP may also bump up the figures. Here‚Äôs how.

1. Growth maths

The Indian economy was supported by increasing domestic demand and the government's capital expenditure during the June quarter, economists polled by Mint said. This was despite an adverse impact from the weakness in net exports. The projected growth rate is faster than the 6.1% year-on-year increase in GDP in the March-ended quarter, but it falls short of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI‚Äôs) prediction of 8%.

Economists in the poll predicted GDP growth rates for the June quarter in a wide range of 6.7% to 8.5%. But only six of the 22 economists predicted a GDP growth of 8% or higher, while only one expected it to be less than 7%.

Economists attributed India's economic momentum during the previous quarter to a strong recovery in the services sector, with the industrial sector also expected to expand. However, agricultural growth is expected to slow, according to some economists who also gave sector-wise projections.

2. Services surge

The average pace of activity in the services sector during the June quarter reached a three-year high, a Mint analysis of the monthly purchasing managers‚Äô index (PMI) data showed. This was despite a slight dip in June. Given that services account for nearly 60% of overall economic output, such consistent growth suggests India will maintain its lead in economic growth over major peers in coming quarters. The PMI is based on a survey of business leaders by S&P Global tracking their perceptions of key indicators of business activity. A reading higher than 50 indicates month-on-month growth in business activity.

Economists at Barclays said services would play a critical role in driving domestic growth this fiscal year, as manufacturing was likely to face challenges due to global headwinds. In fact, the services and manufacturing PMIs have shown a significant divergence in growth already, with the gap between them widening over the past two quarters.

3. Trade effect

At a time when growth in the global economy is slowing, India is unlikely to remain fully insulated from its effect, particularly on the trade front. India‚Äôs goods exports declined 14% year-on-year during the June quarter. Imports, too, fell 13%. While the decline was mainly on account of a fall in global prices of crude oil and other commodities, a significant part also came from weakness in overall international trade.

On the services side, India continued to record a net surplus, with the gap between exports and imports rising year-on-year. As a result, the overall trade deficit (imports minus exports) was narrower from a year ago. Its statistical impact on GDP growth will be positive. In the March quarter, a smaller trade deficit, or net exports, had added 1.5 percentage points to the GDP growth rate. However, beyond the statistical effect, the decline in import and exports of non-oil products are growth risks.

4. Decoding deflators

In the past three years, back-to-back supply disruptions have sent wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation on a roller-coaster ride. It was negative in mid-2020, rose to a high of 16.6% in May 2022, and has retreated to negative territory again since April 2023. The large weight applied to WPI in the task of adjusting GDP growth for inflation (‚Äúdeflation"") will also lead to a high growth figure.

High WPI inflation, as was the case in the past two years, makes real GDP growth look weak. Negative WPI inflation, as is the case now, will have the opposite impact. Moreover, the deflator for the services sector is more aligned with WPI, meaning it has ‚Äúmore manufacturing than it should"", noted Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, in Mint last week. ‚ÄúThis is a problem when manufacturing inflation is falling because of softer commodity prices,"" she wrote. ‚ÄúIt ends up deflating services inadequately, leading to exaggerated real growth.""

5. Bright spot

Amid global uncertainty, India is widely expected to emerge as a bright spot. A report released by the International Monetary Fund said that the global growth in 2023 will be largely led by India and China. According to a consensus of GDP forecasts from international organizations, the RBI, and global rating agencies, India's economy will grow by 6-6.5% in the fiscal year 2023-24. However, that is a slowdown from a year ago. Economists caution that unpredictable monsoon patterns and weak external demand, along with lagged effects of monetary tightening, will put growth at risk in the latter half of the fiscal year, potentially dampening the overall economic expansion.

While the Mint poll shows the Indian economy likely demonstrated robust growth in the June quarter, an expansion of at least 5.7% in the rest of 2023-24 is required for the consensus projection of full-year GDP growth to be realized.

According to a Bloomberg report citing the Chinese Ministry of Finance, the levy charged on stock trades will fall from 0.1 per cent to 0.05 per cent as of August 28.

China also vowed to slow the pace of initial public offerings (IPOs). The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has cited recent market conditions as its rationale for slowing the pace of IPOs.

Beijing's current move is aimed at giving a boost to market sentiment as the world's second-largest economy has been struggling in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Earlier in August, China's central bank went for a smaller-than-expected cut in a key lending benchmark to boost economic recovery. However, the demand for a more robust policy response and hefty government spending is growing.

Could it mean more FII outflow from India?

China's stamp duty cut is expected to have a very short-term impact on the Chinese market and it is unlikely to have a significant impact on other emerging markets (EMs) like India. Experts do not see a risk of foreign capital outflow from the Indian market because of this.

Investor apprehensions are currently centred around China's economic well-being. Without a robust and impactful policy response coupled with substantial government investments, the prospects for the Chinese market could continue to appear subdued.

""China has not only halved the stamp duty but also lowered the margin requirements for buying stocks. Both these steps would help in boosting the markets in the short term,"" said Nitin Agrawal, CEO of Torus Oro PMS.

""Foreign investors are still concerned about the long-term prospects of the Chinese economy and the market has seen record selling from foreign investors over the past few weeks. The property sector is also in bad shape and the stamp duty cut is not going to change long-term fundamentals. We don't see a risk of any outflow of foreign capital from India due to this,"" said Agrawal.

Swapnil Shah, Director of Research at StoxBox said though a knee-jerk positive reaction to the announcement is on the cards, he does not foresee a long-term optimism emanating from this announcement as the economy has been marred with multiple issues such as a slowdown in economic growth, property market crisis and weak consumption patterns.

""We believe that capital inflow/outflow from an economy is dependent on more broad-based factors which include political landscape, economic health, monetary policy, valuation comfort vis-√†-vis other economies and growth prospects of sectors and companies. With China lagging on most of these fronts, China needs a structural reset rather than opting for short-term fixes in order to boost market confidence,"" said Shah.

Shrey Jain, Founder and CEO of SAS Online - India's Deep Discount Broker, observed that the CSI 300 index has experienced an approximately 8 per cent decline over the past month, and since its peak in February 2021, it has recorded a substantial drop of around 36 per cent. This downward trajectory is accompanied by a consistent stream of unfavourable news.

""There is a mattress mentality, people are sticking their under the mattress, not spending, not buying stocks. Such a policy will likely give a short-term boost to the market but won't have much effect over the long run,"" said Jain.

""Foreign investors remain reluctant to invest in China due to a combination of negative news, subdued sentiment, and geopolitical uncertainties. A concerning trend has emerged, with foreign investors consistently selling off their holdings for 13 consecutive sessions, marking the longest such streak on record. To foster sustained FII confidence and promote market participation, Chinese authorities should consider implementing more comprehensive measures,"" said Jain.

Trivesh D, COO of Tradejini also believes the move will not have any long-term impact.

""Any reduction in stamp duty, being a transactional cost will not have a long-term impact on the stock market. Any long-term impact on the stock market is created by investors who predominately invest for longer timeframes, and are agnostic to such changes thereby not affecting their investment decisions,"" said Trivesh.

He added that the foreign capital infused for the purpose of intraday trading, swing trading, positional trading and directional trading may see some inflow on account of a reduction in the stamp duty cost. However, foreign capital meant for investments with a long-term view will not look at this reduction in the stamp duty cost as an attractive factor to pivot their current investments which are deployed in growing investments in the Indian stock market to a politically challenged Chinese economy.

""We do not see any major change in the stance of FIIs and their investment strategy on account of the reduction in stamp duty cost,"" said Trivesh.

B20 Summit 2023: Several business leaders and central government leaders will join the B20 Summit in Delhi today. On the first day of the summit, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that India's upcoming GDP numbers will should be good as Indian economy did well in the first quarter"

Somanathan said on Thursday. India is currently the fifth largest economy behind the US, China, Japan and Germany.

Speaking at a G20 event, Somanathan said that India‚Äôs growth rate, by any measurement, regardless of controversies on how it is measured, is much faster than the top five economies.

‚ÄúAll four have lower growth rates than India and today, we can safely say that all four are likely to have lower growth rates than India in the foreseeable future,"" he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on Wednesday said at the BRICS summit in South Africa that India is the fastest growing major economy, despite global turbulence, and is set to be a $5 trillion economy soon.

Earlier this month, rating agency S&P Global said that it expects India‚Äôs GDP to grow 6.7% annually from FY24 to FY31, catapulting it from $3.4 trillion during the current fiscal to $6.7 trillion in FY31. However, it added that India will face macro challenges in the upcoming decade to turn traditionally uneven growth into a high and stable trend.

India‚Äôs short-term economic growth will be driven by a 678.6 million strong labour force, though getting more women to enter the workforce will be pivotal for future growth, as only 22% women participated in the workforce as of 2022, S&P said in its report.

Somanathan said, ‚ÄúWe are also focused on improving the tax take. We have been removing lots of tax exemptions so that we can address it from both sides.""

One of the major reforms that have been suggested by economists ahead of the Union budget (FY24) was to remove tax exemptions in the sphere of personal income tax. Somanathan also said that the Indian diaspora can help the country in three ways that include flow of funds, creating demand for products made in their mother country, and opening up educational opportunities. Three broad ways of flows of funds are through remittances, investments, and philanthropy, he added.

Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected India‚Äôs growth at 6.1% in 2023, a 0.2 percentage point upward revision compared with the April projection, due to stronger-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 as a result of stronger domestic investment.

Despite speculation about the possibility of a trade deal before Rishi Sunak's visit to India in September, UK government insiders have indicated that there are no expectations for a full deal to be reached by then.

While officials express hope that a deal could be within reach in the coming months, they emphasise that there are still significant challenges to overcome.

A trade agreement with India has long been considered a coveted goal for the UK, particularly after Brexit. The UK seeks to lower tariffs on its exports, including automobiles and whisky, which currently face high tariffs in India, making them less competitive. However, trade negotiations have faced obstacles, including the UK's reluctance to grant more visas to Indian workers, a matter of concern to both sides.

William Bain of the British Chambers of Commerce highlights the significance of gaining access to the Indian market for British services, particularly in fields such as travel, business, and financial services, as the UK's economy is predominantly services-based.

While formal negotiations are not on the agenda during Trade Secretary Badenoch's visit to India to meet fellow trade ministers in the G20 group of wealthy nations, discussions between officials from both sides will continue in India. A one-on-one meeting with her Indian counterpart is scheduled after the G20 meeting.

Although there have been reports suggesting that a deal is ""close,"" government officials have indicated that a full agreement is unlikely to be reached by September. Negotiations are expected to continue beyond this visit. Rishi Sunak's upcoming visit in September for the G20 leaders' summit is anticipated to be warmly received, particularly in light of his appointment as the first British Indian prime minister.

The UK is committed to pursuing the best possible deal for both parties, with a focus on goods, services, and investment. The ultimate goal is a fair and balanced agreement that serves the best interests of the UK and its economy.

124,mint,Why is the govt putting conditions on interest-free loans to states?,https://www.livemint.com/economy/mint-explainer-why-is-the-govt-putting-conditions-on-interest-free-loans-to-states-11692865911703.html,24 Aug 2023,,"New Delhi: A union government scheme introduced during the early days of the covid pandemic , under which it would provide interest-free capital expenditure (capex) loans, will now come with caveats as the government attempts to nudge states to implement specific reforms. Mint explains the rationale behind the government's decision.

How much money has the central government disbursed to states under the interest-free capex loans initiative during FY24?

About ‚Çπ80,000 crore of interest-free loans have been sanctioned to states for this fiscal year and almost ‚Çπ40,000 crore has been disbursed to states so far.

What are the conditions for states to get the remaining amount?

Of the remaining ‚Çπ40,000 crore, about ‚Çπ30,000 crore will be disbursed only if states can show progress on reforms or present specific project proposals. The conditions include reforms in the housing sector; providing incentives to scrap government vehicles and ambulances; reforms in urban planning and urban finance; increasing housing stock for police personnel; and setting up libraries with digital infrastructure at the panchayat and ward levels for children and young adults.

Why is the government imposing such conditions on states?

It‚Äôs to ensure that the loan is used to supplement their capex and not as a substitute for it. These funds can only be used to fund reforms and initiatives, or on sector-specific projects. This condition will apply only for the second installment.

How will this initiative help states?

Interest-free loans with a tenure of 50 years have played a vital role in stimulating capital spending by the states and catalysing the economy in the aftermath of the pandemic.

Which states have opted for interest-free loans so far to boost their capex in FY24?

As many as 16 states have opted for long-term, interest-free loans from the union government. These are Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal."

In a virtual address to the G20 Trade and Investment ministerial meeting in Jaipur on Thursday, PM highlighted the historical role of trade in connecting people, cultures, and technology. He emphasised how trade and globalisation have lifted millions out of extreme poverty throughout history.

Prime Minister Modi expressed optimism about the Indian economy, stating that India is seen as a land of opportunities, openness, and choices. He mentioned that India has become the fifth-largest global economy due to sustained government efforts, including initiatives like ""Reform, Perform, and Transform"" and policies promoting competitiveness, transparency, digitisation, and innovation. ‚ÄúWe have moved away from red tape to red carpet and liberalized FDI flows"", PM Modi said.

He also mentioned initiatives like the 'Open Network for Digital Commerce' and 'High-Level Principles for the Digitalisation of Trade Documents,' emphasising digitisation's potential to enhance market access.

Prime Minister Modi advocated for a rules-based, open, inclusive, and multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core. He mentioned India's advocacy for the Global South's concerns at the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference and emphasized supporting MSMEs, which play a significant role in the global economy. He also said that India has integrated MSMEs into public procurement through the online platform and has been working with them to adopt the ethos of ‚ÄòZero Defect‚Äô and ‚ÄòZero Effect‚Äô on the environment.

126,mint,Why are global bond yields rising?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/why-are-global-bond-yields-rising-and-how-is-it-impacting-indian-stock-market-11692782695563.html,23 Aug 2023,,"Global bond yields are flaring up to the levels unseen in years, drawing support from strong macroeconomic data that makes a case for continuing with the monetary tightening policy through interest rate hikes.

In the US, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have soared to levels around 4.366%, their highest since 2007, prompting investors to initiate risk-off trade.

The US treasury yields have climbed almost 40 bps month-to-date amid rising bets that interest rates will remain elevated for longer. This has spooked investors and the equity markets have remained mostly under pressure.

To tame the soaring inflation, the US Federal Reserve has increased the borrowing costs to their highest level in more than 22 years, in a rate hike cycle that started in March 2022. In its latest monetary policy, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) hiked benchmark interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range, its 11th hike in its last 12 meetings, and left the door open to another increase.

Just as markets were hoping for easing interest rates, strong US economic data reduced the possibility of it.

US retail sales rose 0.7% in July, far higher than expectations, while the economy grew at a 2.4% annualized rate in the second quarter. This was well above the expectations and market participants believe that the inflation would not cool off soon, raising bets of further interest rate hikes.

‚ÄúInterest in US bonds is driven by GDP growth expectations on the back of a resilient jobs market and continued higher inflation that is keeping the expectations of ‚Äúhigher for longer"" interest rates,"" said Srikanth Subramanian, CEO of Kotak Cherry.

He expect the US Fed to increase the rates by 25 bps in September thus pushing the US yields higher.

Meanwhile, markets are looking ahead to Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs address on Friday at the Jackson Hole Symposium for clues on future monetary policy.

Indian bond yields

On the domestic front, Indian government bond yields have been following the US yields slowly. The benchmark bond yield hit over a four-month high of 7.26% last Thursday.

The benchmark government 7.26% 2033 bond yield was trading around 7.2078% on Wednesday.

However, while the 10-year US yield has risen nearly 35 bps in the last two weeks to 4.30%, the Indian benchmark 10-year bond yield has gained just around five basis points (bps) in the same period.

Meanwhile, the spread between Indian and US government bonds has fallen below 300 basis points (bps), the lowest in 14 years, as local yields did not react much to the spike in their US counterparts.

The spread between the duo has eased to 290 bps, a level similar to June 2009, dropping from 320 bps two weeks ago. The spread had hit a 14-year-low in May, shrinking to around 315 bps, Reuters reported.

Bond yields in India have averted a huge spike as investors do not expect any further hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The central bank had, in its August monetary policy, kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.5% but revised upwards its inflation forecast strengthening the case of ‚Äòhigher for longer‚Äô, a theme that is playing out globally too.

Read here: RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das delivers ‚Äòhawkish pause‚Äô; remains cautious on inflation

Since May 2022, the central bank has raised the repo rate by 250 basis points (bps).

With domestic retail inflation, measured in consumer price index (CPI), surging to 15-month high peak of 7.44% in July, expectations are ripe that the RBI will not cut interest rates soon and high interest rates will prevail for long. This has kept the bond yields elevated.

Impact on Markets

Rising bond yields have spooked the equity market as investors tend to shift away from risky assets. The sharp spike in US bond yields negatively impact the capital flows to emerging markets like India.

Nifty has fallen 1.45% in the last one month weighed down by persistent selling by foreign institutional investors (FII). The FIIs have sold Indian equities worth more than ‚Çπ13,000 crore in August.

‚ÄúSustained rise in FII inflows will happen only if the US bond yields decline. Clarity on this will emerge only after trends in US inflation and Fed‚Äôs monetary stance indicate softening. Investors should wait for clarity on these macro trends,"" said K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

Meanwhile, he suggests that long-term investors can accumulate high quality growth stocks.

‚ÄúLarge-cap banks are now fairly valued. The prospects for large-caps in the capital goods sector are bright,"" Vijayakumar said.

While nations are embracing the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) defined at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Brazil in 2012, corporations are also trying out sustainability initiatives in the ESG (environment, social and governance) space.

Yet, things aren‚Äôt moving as fast as required, experts said.

According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the annual mean global surface temperature was 1.15 degrees higher than the baseline in 2022. The baseline refers to temperatures seen in the pre-industrial era. The WMO estimates that, between 2023 and 2027, this temperature will be 1.1-1.8 degree higher, potentially surpassing the tipping point of 1.5 degrees, which, if breached, would lead to irreversible climate chaos.

Will it be possible to halt the rise or at least slow it down?

Amid conversations on countering the possible existential danger to humanity, Mint has assembled India‚Äôs leading experts for a deep dive into the issues facing the Indian economy from a green angle. The Mint Sustainability Summit, to be held in New Delhi today, will see a star-studded galaxy of speakers debating the issues and striving to find solutions to the challenging road ahead.

Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, along with key figures like Sumant Sinha of ReNew Power and Arunabha Ghosh of CEEW, alongside corporate leaders like R.P. Gupta of Solar Energy Corp. of India, Gurdeep Singh of NTPC, Vikram Pawah of BMW India, Kamran Khan of Deutsche Bank, and Sanjeev Panchal of AstraZeneca India, will join a distinguished group of chief sustainability officers from major corporations, including Hindustan Unilever, Nestle, Larsen & Toubro, ITC, and Greenko, to engage in real, actionable strategies to make a difference.

They will discuss issues including the nature of India‚Äôs sustainability playbook, the path to 500GW renewable energy capacity, the green mobility imperative, financing the green transition, and the ESG battles of corporate India.

While the world is perilously close to the cliff edge, fortunately, emissions of the principal component of greenhouse gases (GHGs), energy-related carbon dioxide, slowed to a mere 0.9% in 2022 from 6% in the previous year, according to the International Energy Agency. The global-scale move towards renewable energy sources has seemingly begun to take effect. India is doing its part. A sustained push has managed to get renewable energy to breach 40% of the country‚Äôs energy capacity. There are other, bigger targets in the offing, and action is clearly visible on multiple fronts.

Will our efforts make a difference? They have to. Because as Guterres said: ‚ÄúWe are in the fight of our lives, and we are losing."" That needs to change. Fast.

Further, Chinese macroeconomic data, which showed that the economy is slowing faster than anticipated earlier, was another contributing reason weighing on the market sentiment.

The 30-share BSE Sensex ended at 65,151.02 down 388.40 points or down 0.59% while the Nifty also closed at 19,365.25 level, down 99.75 points or 0.51%.

Expert View on Market

""The mounting influence of weak global cues hindered the domestic market's ability to recoup, resulting in sustained selling pressure. The release of Fed minutes unveiled a divided stance among its members regarding the necessity of additional rate hikes, contrasting the previously anticipated rate pause.

Concurrently, the Indian rupee experienced a decline due to the dollar index surpassing 103.5; however, likely intervention from the RBI offered a degree of support. Moreover, the escalation of US bond yields is expected to limit the influx of foreign investments into the Indian market, further impacting market dynamics,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Technical Views on Nifty

According to Rajesh Bhosale - Equity Technical and Derivative Analyst, Angel One, once again, the US markets experienced a weak trading session overnight, and taking cues from there, the GIFT Nifty indicated a sluggish start.

However, the actual beginning was relatively steady, opening on a neutral note. Nevertheless, prices swiftly declined thereafter, revisiting the low seen on Wednesday. In the latter part of the session, significant momentum was missing. Despite this, prices successfully held onto crucial support levels and concluded the session with a decline of around half a percent, settling at 19365.

""From a technical perspective, there hasn't been a substantial shift. Prices persist in oscillating within a notably narrow range of 200 points. On the daily chart, the third consecutive candle has formed within the range of 19300 to 19500. Traders are opting for cautious positions on the index front, awaiting a catalyst for a momentum-driven movement. The aforementioned trading range is defined by two moving averages, with the 50 EMA defending prices at lower levels and the 20 EMA capping prices at higher levels.

Given the intraday indicators indicating oversold conditions alongside positive divergence, we remain hopeful that the 19250 to 19300 range will be upheld in the context of the weekly closure. However, a breach beneath this range could potentially trigger further weakness in the short term, directing prices towards levels around 19000 to 18925,"" said Bhosale.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the country during the 77th Independence Day celebrations at the Red Fort said that India will be a developed country by 2047.

""In 2047, when the country will be celebrating 100 years of Independence, India will be a developed country"", the Prime Minister noted during his speech from the Red Fort.

PM Modi said he is making this statement while looking at the capabilities of the country, its available resources, and most of all based on the power of youth. He added that the next five years are a ‚Äògolden opportunity‚Äô for realizing the dream of becoming a developed nation by 2047.

SBI Research said the Indian population is expected to increase to 1610 million in FY47 from 1400 million in FY23. As a result, the workforce with a taxable base is expected to increase to 565 million in FY47 from 313 million in FY23, increasing its share from 59.1% in FY23 to 78% in FY47

Income-tax filers are expected to increase from 70 million in FY23 to 482 million in FY47, increasing its share in the workforce with a taxable base from 22.4% in FY23 to 85.3% in FY47.

Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the Group Chief Economic Advisor at State Bank of India (SBI), on Tuesday, reiterated that India is likely to become the third largest economy by 2027.

Indian economy is currently ranked fifth and is behind the US, China, Japan, and Germany.

‚ÄúThe Prime Minister's speech today (at the Red Fort) underlines the rapid structural transformation the Indian economy has undergone in the last decade,"" SBI‚Äôs Ghosh said as per public broadcaster DD News.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its monthly bulletin, in July said India's real GDP will need to grow at 7.6% annually over the next 25 years to achieve the per capita income level to become a developed economy. India's per capita income is currently estimated at $2,500, while it must be more than $21,664 by 2047, as per World Bank standards, to be classified as a high-income country.

""When we set our mind to a task, we get it done. This has been our track record. This is a new India full of self-confidence...Ye Bharat na rukta hai, na thakta hai, na haanfta hai aur na hi haarta hai (The India of today doesn't stop, tire, gasp or give up),"" PM Modi said.

Independence Day 2023: Top quotes from PM Modi's speech at Red Fort

1) ‚ÄúThe whole country stands with the people of Manipur. Peace is the only way to resolve all disputes. The Centre and the Manipur government are making every effort to ensure that peace returns to the state at the earliest.""

2) ‚ÄúToday, we have demography, democracy, and diversity - these three together have the ability to realize the dreams of the nation.""

3) ‚ÄúIn 2014, when you selected us, Modi had the courage to do reforms. 'Reform, perform, transform' is pushing India to excellence.""

4) ‚ÄúIn 2019, on the basis of performance, you blessed me once again...The next five years are for unprecedented development. The biggest golden moment to realise the dream of 2047 is the coming five years. The next time, on 15th August, from this Red Fort I will present before you the achievements and developments of the country.""

6) ‚ÄúI firmly believe that when the country will celebrate 100 years of freedom in 2047, the country would be a developed India.

9) ‚ÄúIndia made all efforts to control inflation...We can't be content just because our situation is better than the rest of the world. I have to take more steps to see that the burden of inflation goes further down on the citizens of my country. We will take those steps and my efforts will continue.""

10) When we came to power in 2014, we were at the 10th position in the global economic system. Today, with the efforts of 140 Crore Indians, we have reached the fifth position, This did not happen just like that.

135,mint,Five key global and domestic macro developments since the last Independence Day,https://www.livemint.com/economy/independence-day-2023-five-key-global-and-domestic-macro-developments-over-past-year-11692040775926.html,15 Aug 2023,,"The world and India have seen many remarkable macro developments since the last Independence Day. There have been many other significant macro developments since the last Independence Day, including inflation cooling off, India's tax revenue rising, steady corporate earnings of India Inc., normal monsoon in India, and the Russia-Ukraine war continued.

Let's take a look at five key macro developments since the last Independence Day:

1. India is the fifth largest economy: India is now the fifth largest economy in the world behind the US, China, Japan and Germany. As per the World Economic Outlook (WEO) database of the IMF, India‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022 was $3.39 trillion. By 2027, the Indian GDP is expected to touch $5.15 trillion.

2. US evades a recession: The US evaded a looming recession even though the Fed continued hiking rates. Since the Fed started raising interest rates last year, worries about a coming recession in the US mounted. Experts now believe the possibility of a US recession is beginning to recede.

However, the risk of the US facing a recession is still not ruled out. As per a Bloomberg report, ""Economists are predicting the US will escape a recession, though it‚Äôll be well into 2024 before anyone can be sure of it.""

Read more: ‚ÄòUS economy will escape recession, but uncertainty persists until 2024‚Äô, says Economists

3. The war against inflation continues: Central banks worldwide have been vigilant in their efforts to combat inflation. Although inflationary pressures might be showing signs of easing, the battle against rising prices continues.

In July, the US Federal Reserve decided to increase interest rates following a brief pause in June. Conversely, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has chosen to keep rates unchanged over the course of the last three consecutive policy meetings. However, a recent upturn in inflation figures for July has ignited concerns that the RBI might opt to take decisive action and raise interest rates during its forthcoming meeting in October.

4. Indian rupee now above 83 mark: On August 14, the Indian currency closed at 83.18 per dollar. On August 12 last year, the rupee was at 79.64 per dollar. This means the Indian currency has depreciated by over 4 per cent in the last one year against the US dollar.

Most of this weakness could be attributed to the relentless rise of the US dollar against its global peers amid sustained rate hikes by the US Fed.

5. Crude oil prices eased: Crude oil prices have seen a decline since the last Independence Day due to concerns over global economic slowdown which could hit the demand for crude oil as fuel. Crude benchmark Brent Crude was at $98.15 per barrel on August 12 last year. On August 11 this year, Brent Crude closed at 86.81 per barrel.

World's two biggest economies, the US and China have been on a shaky pitch since last year. Both countries are also the largest oil consumers in the world. An economic slowdown in these two countries is bad news for crude oil prices.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's claim of India beco... morePrime Minister Narendra Modi's claim of India becoming a top-three economy is likely due to population and economic growth, rather than his term. Yet, GDP isn't the sole indicator of well-being. While GDP is significant, economists prioritize economic growth and per capita income. Japan's stagnant economy challenges the idea of GDP as the only measure. Other factors like health, education, and environment, ignored by GDP, define a nation's well-being. India's low rankings in hunger, gender gap, and press freedom highlight the discrepancy. GDP should be supplemented with holistic measures to gauge true progress and citizen benefits."

The wholesale price index-based inflation saw a 1.36% contraction in July, according to data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Monday. WPI inflation contracted 4.12% in June and 3.48% in May. The WPI-based inflation stood at 13.93% in July 2022.

Economists polled by Reuters had estimated the wholesale price index for July to register a 2.70% fall.

Fuel and power prices saw the steepest decline, plunging 12.79% from a year earlier, compared with a 12.63% decline in June. In manufactured products, prices fell 2.51% in July, compared with a 2.71% fall recorded in the preceding month. However, food prices, driven by a sharp rise in vegetable prices, shot up 7.75% in July after falling 1.24% in June.

""The increase in price is mainly contributed by food products; machinery and equipment; computer, electronic and optical products; other non-metallic mineral products and electrical equipment etc.,"" the official statement said.

To put things in perspective, the month-on-month change in the food index stood higher by 7.13% while the all commodities index was up 1.95%. Vegetables inflation, part of the primary articles index, rose 62.12% in July after falling during the previous month.

""The wholesale price index (WPI) continued in a deflationary zone for the fourth consecutive month in July, helped by lower metals, chemicals, textile, manufactured food, and mineral oils prices. However, the pace of annualised decline in WPI slowed significantly compared with the previous two months, with the spike in food prices led by vegetables restricting the downside,"" said Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist at Care Ratings Ltd.

""If the food prices continue to trend upward, the deflationary trend could end, and WPI inflation could turn marginally positive in the coming months. Additionally, the uptrend in global crude oil prices, global edible oil prices, and uneven monsoon distribution domestically pose an upside risk to the outlook,"" Sinha added.

Sinha expects the WPI inflation for this fiscal at a subdued level --in the range of 1-2%-- with positive implications for the retail inflation trajectory.

Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had left the repo rate unchanged at 6.50% after terming the recent spike in vegetable prices to demand-supply mismatch.

India's consumer price inflation (CPI), or retail inflation, for the month of July, is expected to shoot up to a six-month high, thanks to surging prices of vegetables, cereals and pulses.

According to a Mint poll of 19 economists, India‚Äôs retail inflation might have hit a six-month high of 6.50% in July, sharply up from 4.81% in June. The official data is scheduled to be released Monday evening.

Since March, inflation has stayed under the 6% mark, even dropping to a 25-month low of 4.3% in May, before rising again in June.

140,mint,Why India should lead Africa‚Äôs integration with the global economy,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/first-person/why-india-should-lead-africa-s-integration-with-the-global-economy-11691922923344.html,17 Aug 2023,,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs state visit to the United States in June made headlines on several accounts. One of them was US President Joe Biden‚Äôs endorsement of the idea of making the African Union (AU) a permanent member of the G20 ‚Äì to form the G21. This initiative of African integration represents a core element of India‚Äôs 2023 G20 legacy and exemplifies its commitment to the theme of ‚ÄòVasudhaiva Kutumbakam‚Äô (the world is one family). Having been widely accepted by several G20 leaders, the initiative has paved the way for discourse on what exactly this means for both Africa and the rest of the world, and how India is the right partner to help build bridges for global integration.

The subject of Africa‚Äôs integration journey is a bi-dimensional one tethered to diplomatic and economic integration. Diplomatic integration entails giving the AU a larger voice on the world stage. Global governance architecture has had its foundation in representation through sheer economic size, thus spearheaded for long by developed nations, or the ‚ÄòGlobal North.‚Äô Representing about 85% of the world‚Äôs population, the ‚ÄòGlobal South‚Äô has been working towards presenting a united front, pushing for reforms in governance and wider representation of the interests of developing economies.

Economic integration of the continent is critical for the world in myriad ways. More than 50% of the projected increase in global population up to 2050 (8 billion to 9.7 billion) will originate solely from Sub-Saharan African nations, underscoring the pivotal role that Africa‚Äôs youth, workforce and economy will assume in the time to come.

There are only seven years left to achieve the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This brings the subject of African integration to the forefront, given that the continent is home to 33 of the world‚Äôs 46 least developed countries. While progress on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) continues, Africa remains geographically, logistically and economically fragmented. Bringing the AU into the G20 is an ideal first step towards strengthening both diplomatic and economic integration, and a giant leap forward in reinstalling multilateral trust.

The AU can make its voice heard not only on matters of geopolitical significance, but also on high-priority subjects ranging from climate finance and a just energy transition to the need for reforms in the Bretton Woods institutions, among others, which directly affect the continent‚Äôs interests.

India's successful journey in driving socio-economic development for its citizens, especially through harnessing the power of digital technologies, presents a valuable blueprint that could be leveraged to empower African nations, fostering inclusive growth and sustainable progress across the continent. India's approach to soft power is non-intrusive and based on partnership, which aligns well with the aspirations of African nations. These factors lay down the case for India being the ideal partner in Africa‚Äôs larger integration journey.

The creation of a dedicated Action Council on African Economic Integration under the Business20 (B20) engagement group by India‚Äôs 2023 presidency has been another noteworthy initiative. While encouraging the global business community to address the need and potential of Africa‚Äôs integration, this paves the way to strengthening the voice of Africa‚Äôs businesses on the global scene. Complemented by recent initiatives like the African Business Leaders Coalition (ABLC), which is the first pan-Africa partnership of CEOs, this would allow African interests to play a steering role in discourse across forums, around modern-day priorities.

That being said, one must acknowledge that the integration journey will have its challenges. AU member states will have to accord due flexibility and agility to the AU Secretariat to present a united front on pressing global matters, despite the prevalence of differing opinions. The AU will also have to strike the right balance between continental priorities (under Agenda 2063) and global priorities that may not always be perfectly aligned. It will also need to strategically strengthen diplomatic relations with individual G20 nations, to receive support and endorsement on critical priorities.

However, the benefits of African Integration far outweigh any potential challenges. Embracing potential is not just Africa's opportunity, but a collective global imperative to nurture a continent that holds the key to a brighter future for us all. Through forums like the G20 and B20, the world can show its commitment to enabling the continent‚Äôs transformation by building and strengthening bridges of integration.

As per details, the government pays local manufacturers -- under the $24 billion scheme -- when targets such as sales are met, aiming to boost investment in manufacturing. Though targets differ from sector to sector.

The production-linked payouts, launched in 2020, cover 14 sectors, ranging from electronic products to pharmaceutical drugs, and are crucial to boosting jobs in manufacturing, an area where India has struggled, added the report.

Meanwhile, the government has assured global players in the laptop and IT hardware manufacturing space that there won‚Äôt be a ‚Äòlicense raj‚Äô policy that will be adopted the government but the move to prohibit non-licensed imports of laptops, tablets, and servers et al was aimed at boosting domestic production locally.

The meeting came days after India imposed restrictions on laptops, tablets, and servers among other items on 3 August, and a day later extended the deadline for implementing the restrictions till November 1, 2023. The move took the industry by surprise and requests for more time for compliance were made to the government, Mint reported last week.

142,mint,China slips into deflation. How will this affect Indian economy?,https://www.livemint.com/economy/china-slips-into-deflation-how-will-this-affect-indian-economy-11691672657687.html,10 Aug 2023,,"China's economy has slipped into deflation after consumer prices declined in July for the first time since February 2021. The east Asian country and second biggest economy of the world had seen a significant slowdown in economic progress, owing to prolonged period of stringent Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdown.

According to reports, the official consumer price index, a measure of inflation, fell by 0.3% last month from a year earlier. On Tuesday, official figures showed that China's exports fell by 14.5% in July compared with a year earlier, while imports dropped 12.4%.

According to a report by CNN, the cost of food, transportation, and household goods all declined in July in China. In particular, pork prices were down 26%, and vegetable prices were down 1.5%, the media outlet reported.

What is Deflation?

‚ÄúDeflation is when the prices of goods and services decrease across the entire economy, increasing the purchasing power of consumers. It is the opposite of inflation and can be considered bad for a nation as it can signal a downturn in an economy, leading to a recession or depression,"" Investopedia describes.

Repercussions of Deflation

President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday to block and regulate high-tech U.S.-based investments going towards China ‚Äî a move the administration said was targeted but it also reflected an intensifying competition between the world's two biggest powers.

Not a repercussion, but an impact - e-commerce giant Alibaba announced an unexpected 14 percent on-year increase in quarterly sales following several difficult years and in spite of a broader economic slowdown, reported AFP.

It is to be noted that Alibaba is a key player in China's expansive digital economy and the operator of a major online shopping platform.

How China's Deflation affects India?

Positive effect: If investment in the Chinese economy is lowered owing to the increasing slowing rate of their economy, and now deflation, India could potentially emerge and take over as the manufacturing hub for the developed economies. This is also something the developed countries seem to have been pushing for in a bid to eliminate the monopoly-like hold China has over the manufacturing sector.

For India, if economic reforms are accelerated, India can become the next manufacturing hub.

Negative effect: China remains one of the biggest importer of iron ore from India. The east Asian country imports almost 70% of Iron-ore from India. Therefore, a slower economy for China would mean the amount of import into China could fall, spelling somewhat doom from Indian's economy.

China had been registering a weak import and export numbers, raising questions about the country's post-pandemic recovery.

How does China's Deflation affect the world?

For once, the extended period of deflation China may be that it helps to curb rising prices in other parts of the world, including the United Kingdom. This is because China remains one of the largest producer of goods sold around the world.

On the other hand, cut-prices of China manufactured goods could impact employment by way that it could hit investment by businesses. ‚ÄúA period of falling prices in China could also hit company profits and consumer spending. This may then lead to higher unemployment."" says BBC.

Therefore, decreasing prices, even though lucrative for consumers initially, may lead to a vicious cycle of decreasing economic activity. Reduction in demand, owing to a constant pattern of falling prices would mean lower production, reduced business revenues, and increased unemployment, which in turn further reduces consumer spending.

She said favourable economic factors give India optimism about the future while the West is confronted by twin challenges of high inflation and slow growth and China by a consumer demand slowdown.

In her speech on the no-confidence motion moved by the Opposition, Sitharaman credited the Modi government's policies and transformation in governance for stable economic growth.

The minister said that to cool food inflation, steps are being taken. Tur dal (split pigeon pea) import shipments from Mozambique are on the way and 300,000 tonne of urad dal (split and skinned black gram) is expected to be imported from Myanmar which will also help to cool prices, the minister said. Tomato is being procured from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka for distribution in the National Capital Region. ""We have also initiated (tomato) imports from Nepal by removing the import restrictions and the first lot of tomatoes are expected to reach Varanasi, Luhnow and Kanpur by Friday itself,"" the minister assured.

The minister said that aggressive disposal measures are being taken in the case of moong dal (green gram) for which sufficient domestic stock is available. Procurement of imported masoor dal has been initiated which will add to the reserves, the minister said. The government is also converting chana into chana dal for retail disposal under ‚ÄòBharat Dal' initiative and procurement of 300,000 tonne of onion has been completed. National Cooperative Consumers Federation of India is planning a sale of tomatoes in national capital region at subsidised price of ‚Çπ70 a kilo, the minister said.

""In the case of these essential commodities, we are taking enough steps but more will also be taken because we are conscious that people need essentials at an affordable price,"" the minister assured.

In her speech that lasted more than an hour, Sitharaman countered the no confidence motion moved by the Opposition, capturing the milestones achieved under the NDA regime in infrastructure creation, digitisation of economy and administration, delivery of welfare schemes, cleaning up of bank balance sheets and the tag of the fifth largest economy that India has attained. Sitharaman's speech also showcased how economic development, efficient governance and welfare of the vulnerable will remain as key issues on which NDA will contest national polls next year.

India is in a position of being optimistic about the future now while advanced economies are confronting challenges of high inflation and slow growth, Sitharaman said, crediting the Modi government's policies and transformation in governance for the stable growth rate.

The minister said that while the UK is facing 15-year high interest rates and EU 23-year high interest rates, other major economies like Germany and China are facing economic contraction and consumer demand stagnation, respectively.

The minister said that while the global economy is slowing down, and expected to clock 2.1% growth in 2023 as per the World Bank outlook, India's GDP is expected to grow at 6.5% during 2023-24 backed by reforms.

Sitharaman said Morgan Stanley had categorised India as one of the five fragile economies worldwide in 2013, but recently upgraded India's ratings. The global financial services major had earlier this month upgraded its view on India to overweight from equal weight, four months after the firm upgraded India‚Äôs outlook from underweight, citing strong capex and profit outlook, among other factors that include macro economic stability and the government's reforms agenda.

""Within a span of just nine years, the Indian economy has risen and experienced substantial economic growth, largely attributed to the policies of the government, even in the face of the Covid pandemic,"" the minister added.

On the banking sector, Sitharaman said that the health of the banking sector under the Modi government has improved. ""State-run banks have witnessed record profits of over ‚Çπ1 lakh crore in FY23 and gross and net bad loan levels are at their lowest in about a decade,"" Sitharaman said.

""UPA showed people dreams, NDA fulfilled them,"" said Sitharaman said while countering the no confidence motion. ""We believe in the empowerment of all, but appeasement of none,"" she said.

Meanwhile, opposition party members of Congress, DMK, TMC, and Left parties staged a walkout from the House while Sitharaman listed out the achievements of the NDA government.

‚ÄúIt has been decided that with effect from the fortnight beginning August 12, 2023, scheduled banks shall maintain an incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR) of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19, 2023 and July 28, 2023.

The media, analysts and economists immediately jumped in with their opinion. Some said that this was very much possible. In this piece, we analyse if India can indeed become the third largest economy before 2029, when the term of the next (18th) Lok Sabha ends.

View Full Image Graphic: Mint

While India becoming the fourth largest economy in the world before 2029 is a given, becoming the third largest may not be so easy. Read on.

The present

As per data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India is the fifth largest economy in the world today, behind the US, China, Japan and Germany. As per the World Economic Outlook (WEO) database of the IMF, India‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022 was $3.39 trillion. The GDP is a measure of the economic size of a country in a particular year. By 2027, the Indian GDP is expected to touch $5.15 trillion.

In 2022, the GDP of Germany, currently the fourth largest economy in the world, was $4.08 trillion. In 2027, it is expected to touch $4.95 trillion. Further, in 2022, the GDP of Japan, currently the world‚Äôs third largest economy, was $4.23 trillion. In 2027, it‚Äôs expected to be at $5.08 trillion. So, by 2027, with a GDP of $5.15 trillion, India will be the world‚Äôs third largest economy. This is what the media and the experts have been highlighting.

There‚Äôs a problem here: these figures are what is termed as GDP in current prices. Now, what does this mean? Let‚Äôs consider the GDP of a country for 2012 in current prices. It would have been calculated using the prices of goods and services in 2012. Now, let‚Äôs consider the GDP of the same country for 2022. Again, it would have been calculated using the prices of goods and services in 2022.

In the normal scheme of things, the prices in any country would be higher in 2022 than in 2012. Hence, the GDP in 2022 would automatically be higher than in 2012, but that would primarily be on account of higher prices. So, clearly, there is a problem because higher prices distort the picture, given that we are trying to compare the economic size of a country, or to put in simple terms, whether more goods and services were being produced in 2022 than in 2012.

How do we deal with this situation? For the economic size in 2022 to be actually comparable to the economic size in 2012, we should calculate the GDP in 2022 using 2012 prices. If the GDP in 2022 is higher than the GDP in 2012, we know for sure that more goods and services are being produced in 2022 than they were in 2012. This means that the size of the economy or the economic output in 2022 is bigger than in 2012.

This way of calculating the GDP is referred to as GDP in constant prices and it takes the rate of increase in prices of goods and services or inflation into account.

There is another problem here. Every country calculates its GDP in their own currency. For a comparison across countries, these values then needed to be converted into US dollars. As the IMF WEO database puts it: ‚ÄúValues are based upon GDP in national currency converted to US dollars using market exchange rates (yearly average).""

So, to calculate the Indian GDP in current prices in US dollars, we need to take the GDP in current prices in Indian rupees and then divide it by the average dollar-rupee exchange rate for that year.

Over the years, the Indian rupee has lost value against the US dollar. This is primarily because inflation in India has been higher than inflation in the US, leading to the Indian rupee losing value. Of course, for a brief period since last year, inflation in the US was higher than in India. Given this phenomenon, when GDP in current prices in Indian rupees is converted into GDP in current prices in US dollars, using the exchange rate, some impact of inflation on the GDP calculation in current prices is taken care of.

But the complete impact of inflation is still not taken into account. This can be seen when we compare the GDP in constant prices in US dollars with GDP in current prices in US dollars. The World Bank publishes the data for GDP in constant prices (in 2015 US dollars). As per this data, the Indian GDP in 2022 stood at $2.95 trillion against IMF‚Äôs calculation of $3.39 trillion in current terms.

Hence, it makes more sense to look at GDP at constant prices, which takes inflation totally into account. As per this data, in 2022, India was the sixth largest economy in the world, behind the US, China, Japan, Germany and the UK (see chart).

The world in 2029

In 2022, the GDP of the UK, in constant terms, stood at $3.16 trillion. The British economy has been in a bad shape post the covid-19 pandemic. The GDP in 2022 was lower than the 2019 GDP of $3.17 trillion. In fact, even in the pre-covid world, Britain grew at a very slow pace‚Äîby 2.03% per year between 2009 and 2019. The overall per year growth in 2023 and 2024 is expected to be lower than 1%. Given this, in 2024, the Indian economy should become bigger than the British economy.

In order to become the fourth largest economy in the world, India will have to overtake Germany. The German GDP in 2022 stood at $3.62 trillion, which was just a little better than its 2019 GDP of $3.60 trillion. Also, like the UK, Germany grew at a very slow pace in the pre-covid years‚Äîby 1.95% per year between 2009 and 2019. The size of the German economy is expected to contract in 2023 and barely grow in 2024.

Even if Germany grows at 2% per year between 2022 and 2029 and India grows at 5.1% per year, India should be a bigger economy than Germany by 2029. Looking at how things stand currently, India‚Äôs chances of becoming the fourth largest economy in the world by 2029 are pretty good.

Japanese challenge

This is the tricky bit. As mentioned earlier, Japan is currently the third largest economy in the world. In 2022, it had a GDP (in constant 2015 US dollars) of $4.51 trillion, far bigger than the Indian economy.

Japan has been growing at a very slow pace over the decades. The per year growth between 1989 and 2019, a period of three decades, has been 1.04% per year. For a period of two decades ending 2019, the growth was 0.82% per year. For the decade ending 2019, the growth was 1.2% per year.

In fact, the size of the Japanese economy in 2022 was smaller than its size of $4.55 trillion in 2017. The World Bank expects the country to grow by 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.6%, in 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. The IMF forecasts a growth of 1.4% and 1%, in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

Taking all these factors into account, let‚Äôs assume that Japan grows at the rate of 0.8% per year from 2022 to 2029, similar to its per year growth over two decades in the pre-pandemic era. At this rate of growth, the Japanese GDP in 2029 will be $4.77 trillion. To overtake Japan, India needs to grow at more than 7.1% per year in constant 2015 dollar terms over the next seven years.

In the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019, India grew at 6.63% per year. If one were to look at growth between 1991, when economic reforms were initiated, and 2019, it stood at 6.43% per year. So, expecting a higher than 7.1% per year growth is a bit of a stretch, especially in the aftermath of the pandemic‚Äîthe GDP growth between 2019 and 2022 stood at 3.19% per year.

Of course, it‚Äôs possible that Japan might grow slower than 0.8% per year. What if it grows at 0.5% per year? Then the Indian economy will have to grow faster than 6.78% per year to become bigger than the Japanese economy. This again looks a tad difficult, going by the past and the current scenario.

Having said that, ceteris paribus, the Indian economy will most likely become bigger than the Japanese economy in the early 2030s. The chances of that happening are pretty good.

Par for the course?

Most Western economies which are bigger than India have never really been able to come out of the negative effects of the financial crisis of 2008. They are also facing a contraction in their working-age population (except the US), which consists of population from the age of 15 to 64.

In Japan, the working-age population peaked at 87.2 million in 1994 and has since contracted by around a sixth to 73.1 million. As Ruchir Sharma writes in The 10 Rules of Successful Nations: ‚ÄúEconomic growth‚Ä¶ is the sum of‚Ä¶ how many more workers are entering the labor force, plus how much more they are producing."" The idea is that as more individuals enter the workforce, they find jobs and spend money, in the process drive economic growth.

In India‚Äôs case, the population from ages 15 to 64 continues to grow, albeit at a much smaller pace than in the past, and in 2022, this cohort totalled 961 million. In fact, if we look at India‚Äôs youth population (individuals in the age bracket 15-29), it throws up a very interesting trend. As a government report titled ‚ÄòYouth in India 2022‚Äô points out: ‚ÄúThe total youth population increased from 222.7 million in 1991 to 333.4 million in 2011 and is projected to reach 371.4 million by 2021."" In fact, the number of Indian youth might already have peaked. It is expected to contract to 367.4 million by 2026, 356.6 million by 2031 and 345.5 million by 2036.

Income matters

In all the hype around India becoming the third largest economy in the world, one should not forget that the per capita income, or the average income of an Indian, is a metric that matters more. While the British and Indian economies are almost similar in size, in Britain‚Äôs case, the population is significantly lower than that of India. Hence, its economic output, which is almost similar to that of India, is actually shared among fewer people, making the economic situation of an average Britisher much better than that of an average Indian (see chart).

In 2022, India‚Äôs per capita income was at $2,085, whereas it was $47,232 in the UK. This is a metric that needs to be talked about more if the idea is to talk about the real economic scenario as it prevails.

As of March, the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of banks, or bad loans, had shrunk to 3.9% of total loans in 2022-23, the lowest level since 2014, according to the Financial Stability Report issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in June.

Indian banks never really recovered from the shock of the global financial crisis of 2008. As chart 1 shows, while their gross NPAs were low going into the crisis, they began a slow but steady upward climb over the next few years. While they survived the much harsher punishment that banks in other countries faced (closures, collapses and bankruptcies), it was clear by the middle years of the last decade that there was a serious problem‚Äîby 2017-18, gross NPAs had climbed into double digits.

This was partly a good thing, since it finally meant the system, as a whole, was being forced to recognize bad loans. But it also meant that a process of clean-up had to be put in place. On the downside, the ability of banks to actually recover money from borrowers that they had earlier written off (with the potential that this could go straight back to the bottom line), was abysmal. Just 18% of the amount written off could be recovered in the last three years.

But while banks were straightening out their balance sheets, a major shift was happening elsewhere. Banks were pulling back sharply on loans to industry, and were filling that gap with retail loans to individual consumers‚Äîhome loans mainly, but also loans to buy vehicles and consumer durables, and on credit cards. This phenomenon was described as the ‚Äòconsumerization of credit‚Äô by economists Rajeswari Sengupta and Harsh Vardhan, in an Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research (IGIDR) working paper in 2022.

Pros and cons

Between March 2014 and March this year, the share of non-agricultural bank loans to industry, services and trade declined by almost 20 percentage points to just under 50%. Over this period, the share of consumer loans rose from 18% to 32%, according to RBI data. A recent review of retail credit in the RBI‚Äôs monthly bulletin pointed out, ‚Äúretail segment played a major role in the recovery of overall credit growth in the post-covid period.""

What are the implications of such a shift for both consumers and the banking sector? For years, retail credit in India, especially home loans, was seen as a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô bet by banks‚Äîfor the vast majority of borrowers, a home loan was the biggest investment they would ever make. Even if economic conditions turned bad, and people lost their jobs, they would cut back personal spending sharply rather than default on their home loans. So far, the data has borne out the supposed ‚Äòlow-risk‚Äô nature of such loans‚Äîgross NPAs for all consumer loans were 1.4% of total loans, as of March.

Over the next couple of years, however, this claim is likely to be tested‚Äîthe 2008 global crisis was, after all, triggered by over-indebtedness of households in real estate. As the RBI review pointed out: ‚ÄúThe better asset quality in the retail segment‚Ä¶appears to be contributing to banks‚Äô increased focus on retail credit. However, this is not a risk-free segment and not a panacea for asset quality concerns in non-retail loans."" On the plus side, the review argues that the boom in retail credit is cyclical, and is likely to reverse as corporate and industrial capital expenditure revives.

Household Finances

In absolute terms, retail credit outstanding of Indian banks amounted to about ‚Çπ41 trillion, as of March 2023‚Äîdouble that of the level just five years earlier. Over that time, the covid crisis hit, followed by the Ukraine war. Globally, monetary policy has undergone its most serious ‚Äòtightening‚Äô in decades. On 27 July, the US central bank hiked interest rates to levels not seen since the US housing crash in 2007, which precipitated the global crisis of 2008. RBI, too, followed suit, as have other central banks around the world.

Faced with such signals, banks also have been quick to increase interest rates across all categories of loans, including retail loans. Chart 2 breaks down the current outstanding amount of home loans given by banks by the interest rate charged on that amount to borrowers. As recently as two years ago, in March 2021, around 80% of home loans outstanding were charged at an interest rate of below 8%. By March this year, that component of home loans had fallen to just around 12%. At the opposite end, close to 70% of home loans outstanding are now charged at 9% or more.

To illustrate the impact on home loan EMIs (equated monthly instalments), consider a household that took a home loan of ‚Çπ50 lakh at 7% interest for 20 years. The EMI works out to ‚Çπ38,765. Increase the interest rates to 9%, and the EMI increases about 15% to ‚Çπ45,000. In many cases, borrowers can opt to increase the tenure of their loan, while keeping their EMI constant, but this increases the interest paid. Further, this is simply not feasible beyond a point, especially if the EMI is too small to even cover the increased interest on the loan. In such cases, banks will force borrowers to increase their monthly payments. Add inflation to the mix (even though it has come down in recent months), and this puts a further strain on household finances. What does this mean for the economy as a whole, in terms of long-term growth?

Households and the Economy

When economists talk about increasing investment in the country, they almost always mean corporate and infrastructure investment‚Äîmoney put towards building more factories or bigger factories, or bridges or roads. But as Nikhil Gupta and Tanisha Ladha of Motilal Oswal pointed out in a recent research report, households account for two-fifths of all investments in India, primarily in housing. This is higher than in China, the US, France or Germany. Yet, the authors argue, housing debt, at 10% of GDP (gross domestic product), is much lower than in most countries they studied.

Yet, in a way, this number is misleading. As the latest RBI Financial Stability Report points out (in a reference to overall indebtedness of households across all categories of loans), the ratio of household debt to GDP ‚Äúdoes not factor in household wealth across income groups and provides no information on distribution of debt."" More simply, the bulk of that debt is concentrated among a small sliver of households which are eligible for loans.

The RBI report, for instance, estimated that as of March, 40% of all home loans were owed by households earning more than ‚Çπ1.4 lakh per month, or ‚Çπ16.8 lakh per annum. The data was based on a sample rather than the entire universe of home loans, but it is worth noting that as of 2018-19, a total of 2.5 million individuals filed income tax returns with a reported income of above ‚Çπ15 lakh per annum.

In an exercise, the central bank report attempted to estimate the proportion of borrowers who did not earn enough take-home income to pay their EMIs, and have money for basic necessities, in the current environment, when inflation has risen (making necessities more expensive) and interest rates are up (forcing households to pay more toward EMIs). It found that the share of home loan borrowers who ended up with such a negative ‚Äòfinancial margin‚Äô was 31.6%. In another ominous finding, the same study also noted that the RBI-imposed capital requirements for two banks with large housing loan portfolios fell below the threshold level in such a scenario.

Thus, the risks for banks have not really gone away, even as they have provisioned for their NPAs from earlier years, and pulled back on corporate loans. Instead, the new bets on consumer credit mean that those risks have reappeared, though from a different source. There is unlikely to be any significant danger to the financial system, or even individual banks, in the short term. But the ‚Äòconsumerization of credit‚Äô has bigger implications for the economy as a whole. In the longer term, banks can‚Äôt avoid being affected.

Macro Impacts

A slowdown in overall household consumption, possibly induced by families cutting back to save their loans from going under, will have economy-wide effects too. Households that have a high enough income to qualify for a home loan, as a group, are precisely those households which also tend to be the biggest spenders, in an economy defined by high inequality and a very uneven distribution of discretionary income (after allowing for spending on necessities and for paying debts).

In the last few years, though, personal income growth has been anaemic at best. The Motilal Oswal report points out that the growth of consumption expenditure in the last decade has outpaced that of household incomes, with the only exception being in 2020-21, due to covid, as lockdowns suppressed consumption. ‚ÄúBecause of this combination of weak income and higher consumption growth, not only has household savings collapsed, but its leverage has also increased almost continuously,"" the report points out.

In 2009-10 and 2010-11, household debt was only slightly higher than household savings, implying that one year worth of savings was enough to pay off all household debts. ‚ÄúIn 2021-22, as much as 1.8x-year worth of savings are required to do the same job, implying a deterioration of three-fourths in just about a decade,"" the report‚Äôs authors say.

The report‚Äôs authors, in the context of assessing the health of the real estate sector, point out that, ‚Äúunless there is significant improvement in household income growth, we find it difficult to believe that the momentum in the realty sector could be maintained in India."" As an aside, construction investment as a share of GDP in India is over 15%, outpacing many other developed economies such as the US and the UK. Thus, a slowdown in this sector will have economy-wide effects.

High interest rates, volatile prices of essentials and even increased bank lending to consumers are likely cyclical in nature to an extent. As the economic cycle progresses, and prices adjust downwards, RBI is likely to move to an easier monetary policy as well and cut interest rates. Over time, corporate and government capital expenditure will likely see a bump as well.

In such a scenario, household incomes could reach a comfortable enough level that more households will be able to cover home loan expenses and fewer households will end up with a negative financial margin. But India has a seen close to a decade of underwhelming growth in personal incomes. Even if we move to a higher growth trajectory in the next few years, we are likely to still be playing catch up with other high-income economies."

However, negative cross-border spillovers and adverse global developments can act as a deterrent to achieving the potential high-growth path in the current financial year, the report added.

The Economic Review released by the finance ministry‚Äôs department of economic affairs (DEA) said that the government‚Äôs emphasis on capital expenditure in recent years has given a much-needed thrust to investments in key infrastructure, resulting in crowding in of private investment to kick-start job creation, income, productivity, demand and exports.

These will be supported by favourable demographic dividends over the coming years, it said.

However, the latest monthly review cautioned that higher commodity prices could mean further monetary tightening in the developed world, which will impact the monetary policy trajectory in developing countries due to currency and capital flow effects.

‚ÄúIn sum, India‚Äôs improved monsoon performance, solid fiscal performance, continued expansion in manufacturing and services sectors, vigorous capital expenditure spending by the public and private sectors augurs quite well for India‚Äôs macroeconomic stability and growth in FY24,"" it said.

‚ÄúBut the price of such stability and growth is eternal policy vigilance,"" it added.

Going forward, India‚Äôs domestic fundamentals remain strong, the publication said.

‚ÄúReal GDP growth data for the last quarter of FY23 reaffirmed the ability of the Indian economy to grow on the strength of its domestic demand and investment despite a rise in global uncertainties and moderation in global output,"" it said.

‚ÄúGrowth momentum gathered in this quarter is likely to be sustained in the June 2023 quarter, as reflected in the performance of various high frequency indicators (HFIs), including GST collections, PMI, services exports, electronic toll collection, e-way bills etc,"" it added.

The Economic Review also expects private consumption to improve with the decline in inflationary pressures.

‚ÄúCPI (consumer price index) inflation has witnessed a moderation in recent months, with a pass-through of WPI (wholesale price) inflation getting increasingly reflected. CPI core inflation, which is generally considered a better guide to the direction of future inflation, has also remained below the 6% mark for four consecutive months,"" it said.

Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday it expects India‚Äôs retail inflation to leap to 6.2% at the end of the quarter ending September, against its previous forecast of 5.5%, due to higher prices of food.

However, the consumer price index is expected to moderate to 5-6% in the second half of FY24, according to its estimates."

Why did Morgan Stanley upgrade India?

Morgan Stanley believes a new bull market started in emerging markets last October. From the trough in late October, MSCI EM is up around 25 per cent, Morgan Stanley pointed out.

While the global financial firm downgraded China, it underscored situation in India is in ""stark contrast to that in China.""

""With GDP per capita only $2.5k per capita (versus $12.7k for China) and positive demographic trends, India is arguably at the start of a long wave boom at the same time as China may be ending one. Consider that household debt/GDP in India is just 19 per cent versus 48 per cent for China and only 2 per cent of Indian households have life insurance,"" Morgan Stanley observed.

Besides, Morgan Stanley observed that ""manufacturing and services PMIs have rallied consistently since the end of Covid restrictions in contrast to the rapid fade seen in China. As well, real estate transaction volumes and construction have broken out to the upside.""

Morgan Stanley highlighted India's ability to leverage multipolar world dynamics as a significant advantage.

""It is a member of the Quad political framework with the US, Australia and Japan. It is benefitting from a surge in inward FDI, including from US, Taiwan and Japanese firms looking to its own large domestic market as well as a much-improved export infrastructure situation vis-√†-vis more-efficient ports, road and electricity supply. Private equity firms are expanding in India (and ASEAN) simultaneously as they are struggling with exits in China,"" said Morgan Stanley.

The global financial firm believes India's future looks to a significant extent like China's past, expecting GDP growth in China to be around 3.9 per cent by the end of the decade versus 6.5 per cent for India.

Will Morgan Stanley upgrade mean more foreign inflows for the Indian market?

Morgan Stanley upgrade is justified and positive for India, say experts. They believe India is in a sweet spot and will continue witnessing a healthy inflow of foreign funds because of its robust economic outlook.

G. Chokkalingam, Founder & Head of Research at Equinomics Research pointed out that recently IMF raised India‚Äôs GDP growth to 6.1 per cent for FY24 from a previous estimate of 4.9 per cent and also expects India‚Äôs inflation to decline to 4.9 per cent in FY2024. The government debt to GDP ratio moderated further and capex is rising significantly. All this will augur well for the country and will boost foreign capital inflow, Chokkalingam said.

Shrey Jain, Founder and CEO of SAS Online said Morgan Stanley's bullish stance on India serves as an invitation not only to Indian investors but also to investors worldwide, including FIIs and rating agencies.

""We can expect a continued inflow of foreign capital into the Indian market,"" said Jain.

Shantanu Bhargava, Managing Director, Head of Discretionary Investment Services at Waterfield Advisors pointed out that India has long-term structural interest among most investors.

""The prevailing narrative among global FPIs is India's growing business and political stability, superior demographics, regulatory strength, manufacturing potential, and sovereign investor friendliness. Over the next few years, FPIs will allocate more to India if this structural narrative remains intact, macroeconomic stability is maintained, and relative values don't become completely irrational,"" said Bhargava.

Analysts at the brokerage house raised India‚Äôs rating saying relative valuations are ‚Äúless extreme"" than in October and the nation‚Äôs reform and macro-stability agenda supports a strong capex and profit outlook.

‚ÄúMultipolar World trends are supporting FDI and portfolio flows, with India adding a reform and macro-stability agenda that underpins a strong capex and profit outlook. We see a secular trend toward sustained superior USD EPS growth versus EM over the cycle, with a young demographic profile supporting equity inflows,"" Morgan Stanley report said.

With GDP per capita only $2,500 per capita (vs. $12,700 for China) and positive demographic trends, strategists at Morgan Stanley believe India is arguably at the start of a long wave boom at the same time as China may be ending one.

The brokerage downgraded its rating on Chinese stocks saying investors should take profits and capitalize on a rally led by stimulus packages announced by the government.

The analysts are of the view that easing measures are likely to come piecemeal, which may not be enough for shares to sustain gains.

‚ÄúThe July Politburo meeting signalled policy easing, but key issues including LGFV debt, the property and labour markets and the geopolitical situation need to improve significantly, in our view, for sustainable inflows and further re-rating,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote.

Morgan Stanley also downgraded Taiwan to equal weight, citing stretched valuations amid a rally in tech stocks.

Meanwhile, considering Indian equities and China equities as a pair in USD terms and using the MSCI Indices as the benchmark, Morgan Stanley strategists believe the beginning of a new era of Indian outperformance compared to China appears to be dawning.

From 2003 to 2020, the two markets performed remarkably in line with each other ‚Äì both having a tendency to outperform MSCI EM over the cycle. From early 2021, however, India has broken out dramatically to the upside, having outperformed China by over 100%.

‚ÄúWhilst reversion to the mean is often a powerful force in finance, we think that this represents a structural break in India's favour that warrants a bias to an OW versus a bias to EW or UW for China with the medium-term driver being significantly higher USD EPS growth and ROE over the cycle for India vs. China,"" the brokerage report said.

Moreover, valuations, to some extent, reflect the market's understanding of this structural change ‚Äì and indeed overshot somewhat last October in India's favour, it said adding, ‚ÄúGiven the overall framework we run and that is discussed in the next section, however, we think returning India to an OW and downgrading China to EW is warranted.""

The boost in income will help the country to become a middle-income economy with a GDP of $6 trillion and half of it will be coming from household consumption, the research added.

Since 2001, the per capita GDP grew from $460 to $1,413 in 2011 to $2,150 in 2021.

The primary factor propelling significant economic growth will be external trade, which is anticipated to nearly double to $2.1 trillion by 2030. This substantial increase would be a remarkable jump from the $1.2 trillion recorded in fiscal 2023 when the GDP stood at $3.5 trillion. The report assumes an annual nominal GDP growth of 10% going forward.

Furthermore, the report indicates that the second major contributor to this growth will be household consumption, projected to reach $3.4 trillion by fiscal 2030. This figure would be equivalent to the current size of the GDP. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, household consumption was at $2.1 trillion, representing approximately 57% of the GDP at that time.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised multiple times that the Indian economy will be placed in the top 3 during his next term in office and will reach $5 trillion. Currently, Japan is in third place after the United States and China.

Telangana on top among states

Telangana currently takes the top spot in the per capita income rankings with ‚Çπ2,75,443 (equivalent to $3,360). Following closely are Karnataka with ‚Çπ2,65,623, Tamil Nadu with ‚Çπ2,41,131, Kerala with ‚Çπ2,30,601, and Andhra Pradesh with ‚Çπ2,07,771.

However, the StanC report foresees a shift in this ranking by fiscal 2030, with Gujarat projected to lead in per capita income, followed by Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Haryana, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. Although the report does not mention the names of the other three states, it suggests that they will not be among the top performers.

Currently, the combined contribution of Telangana, Delhi, Karnataka, Haryana, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh to the national GDP stands at 20%. By fiscal 2030, these states are expected to achieve a per capita GDP of $6,000.

The large states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will have per capita income of less than $2,000 by fiscal 2023 which is still two times from their current levels.

The main driving force behind the growth of the economy will remain the increasing proportion of the working-age population. In 2020, the share of working-age individuals in the country accounted for 64.2% of the total population. This figure is projected to rise slightly to 64.8% in the coming years.

However, there may be a marginal decline to 63.6% by the year 2040, and further down to 61.1% by 2050. Despite this gradual decrease, the working-age population will still play a crucial role in shaping the nation's economic development.

161,mint,India bans exports of de-oiled rice bran after white rice,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-bans-exports-of-de-oiled-rice-bran-after-white-rice-11690562234511.html,28 Jul 2023,,"After implementing a ban on white rice exports last week, the Centre has now moved exports of de-oiled rice bran (DORB) into the ‚Äòprohibited‚Äô category from the previously unrestricted ‚Äòfree‚Äô category, according to a notification issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on Friday.

The decision to restrict DORB exports until 30 November was prompted by a significant increase in domestic milk and milk product prices, primarily due to soaring fodder prices. DORB plays a vital role as a key ingredient in cattle, poultry and fish feed, with approximately 25% being used in cattle feed.

The prices of DORB have increased sharply to ‚Çπ18,000-18,500 a tonne from ‚Çπ15,000 per tonne in the last few weeks due to supply tightness.

In 2022-23, India produced a record 5.5 million tonnes of DORB as against the previous year‚Äôs 5 million tonnes, according to the government‚Äôs estimates. However, only 600,000 tonnes of the total 5.5 million tonnes (about 12%) was exported.

Notably, West Bengal stands as a significant producer of DORB. But the eastern part of the country lacks a substantial cattle feed industry and demand for the product, resulting in exports becoming the main outlet for the disposal of DORB.

The Solvent Extractors‚Äô Association of India (SEA) presented documents to the government explaining the challenges faced, particularly the high local freight costs for transporting DORB from eastern India to the southern and western parts of the country. ‚ÄúThis will do irreparable damage not only to the oilseed sector but also to the oilseed farmer. It will also hit the rice milling industry and production of rice bran oil,"" SEA executive director B.V. Mehta said.

As far as the impact of rice bran extraction ban is concerned to reduce milk and milk products prices, ‚Äúeven if the price of the cattle feed is reduced say by 10%, cattle feed value may reduce by 2.5% and ultimately the milk price will reduce not more than 1%,"" explained Mehta.

‚ÄúHowever, there are numerous factors apart from feed ingredient cost including packaging, transport etc. responsible for the milk and milk products prices,"" Mehta added.

Retail milk prices have shot up nearly 22% in three years, including about 10% in the last one year due to affected artificial insemination in animals amid less availability of oxygen cylinder during the COVID-19 second wave in 2021, resulting in lower calf birth and consequently a decline in milk production.

‚ÄúMilk production was also affected because of farmers being unable to take care of animals well in the pandemic when commodities prices shot up influencing fodder prices. This left a significant impact on overall milk productivity which then manifested in shortages of ghee, butter etc. over a year and half. As a result, we have seen a significant hike in milk prices and this year, too, we are expecting a 4-5% year-on-year rise in FY24,"" Crisil director Pushan Sharma told Mint earlier this month in an interview.

In an interview, Sanyal said that maintaining macroeconomic stability and taking care of the bottom of the pyramid are the two key pillars of the government‚Äôs economic management strategy. Edited excerpts:

How do you see the Indian economy faring in the coming quarters?

Our GDP (gross domestic product) rowth will be somewhere in the 6.5-7% range. Given the global uncertainties, I would argue this is a very robust growth rate and makes us the fastest-growing major economy. But, let us be clear that the global environment remains very challenging. There are signs that global growth is slowing down. With the slowing of global trade, exports as a growth generator will not be robust. Given the international situation, energy prices should have eased but have gone up again. The automatic stabilization process, through falling energy prices, is not happening. Meanwhile, global liquidity continues to be tightening. Given this scenario, we need to drive carefully.

Domestic momentum will get us close to 7% growth, but, of course, uncertainties remain around El Ni√±o and the monsoon.

Falling exports are a concern. How should we address the situation?

External demand is clearly weakening, and this will be a challenge. However, our response needs to be calibrated. First, we should not unnecessarily force growth beyond 6.5-7% in an environment where global growth and export markets are faltering. If we try to overcompensate with domestic demand, we will achieve an external imbalance (current account deficit) as exports will not be able to keep up with imports. Second, we should focus on the supply side and on compounding GDP over time. Focus on the supply side means making sure our infrastructure gets built up, our regulations are rational, our financial system remains robust, etc. We should not let global cycles distract us from this.

Given that exports are slowing down, which growth engine should we focus on? We are already the most populous nation, and the economy is shifting towards technology-intensive industries where job creation can happen. Have we missed the tide on the demographic dividend?

In my view, a 6.5-7% growth rate under the current circumstances is an acceptable growth rate. External demand cycles should not distract us. The point that I am making is, do not sacrifice macroeconomic stability to force growth in a particular year. It is about compounding, which requires maintaining macroeconomic stability. We need to keep investing in our supply side. Over time, we will get back to 8%-plus growth when global circumstances allow it.

We will be in this demographic dividend phase for about 25 years. We have just entered that phase, and the key is to maintain steady growth till 2047. China‚Äôs success was not about high growth in any one or two years, but its ability to sustain it over decades. In contrast, The Asian Crisis stalled many economies, and they never recovered. It is all about compounding. Hence, my emphasis on the importance of macro-stability and financial sustainability.

What kind of reforms is the government looking to aid the growth story?

Let us look at the kinds of reforms we have done so far. In the 1990s, we had liberalization. We were trying to open up sectors from the old licence-permit system. Along the way, it was understood that these liberalized sectors needed to be regulated, so regulatory bodies were created. We grew for some two-odd decades because of the first round of reforms.

Then, in 2014, we began to do a new kind of reform. These were to create the broader frameworks for the functioning of an innovation and entrepreneurship economy. We introduced an inflation-targeting framework for macroeconomic stability. We introduced GST (goods and services tax) to create a common market. We introduced the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code to allow a framework for creative destruction. The banking system clean-up was done to create a robust financial system. This phase is now getting completed.

We are now looking at process reform. Process reforms are the nuts and bolts of the economy. These are things like expanding the patenting system, decriminalizing legal metrology provisions (weights, measures, labels), simplifying building codes, etc. This is a large area of work. Separately, there are two major areas of reform that will probably take more than 10 years to implement. One is administrative reform, which is about reforming the bureaucracy. And the other major area of reform is the legal system. Here we need a frank public debate.

What is the government‚Äôs vision of the rupee as a global currency?

We are trying to systematically internationalize in the hope that the Indian rupee will be a hard currency in a decade‚Äôs time. Note that we are not trying to disturb the US dollar‚Äôs position as the world‚Äôs anchor currency; it will remain the anchor currency for the foreseeable future. There may be one global anchor currency, but there are many hard currencies like the Japanese yen, the British pound, the euro, China‚Äôs yuan and so on. The idea is to convert the Indian rupee into a hard currency. That is our limited objective, and we are taking all the systematic steps. We hope that once the Indian rupee has become a hard currency, it will also become a part of the IMF‚Äôs SDR (special drawing rights) basket and be held by others as foreign exchange reserves. In turn, this will lower India‚Äôs financing costs.

Is there an urgency to loosen monetary policy at this juncture?

The Reserve Bank has responded responsibly to the challenges. We already paused monetary tightening before the others as we had maintained macro stability much better than other countries during the covid-19 shock. Some countries are still tightening as they have overextended themselves. I am confident that RBI is on top of things.

On the manufacturing front, have we missed the bus?

There is a lot of interest from global companies to relocate to India. Many of them already have their service centres in India. So, when we talk about making chips, for example, remember that many of those chips are already designed in India. Similarly, India‚Äôs private sector investment is finally gathering some pace. It takes time for these things to be built, but it is happening. Meanwhile, we have to keep investing in our supply side. Make sure our infrastructure is good enough. Our processes are good enough, our bureaucratic red tape is in check. I do not agree with the view that India can keep growing just with services, so we have no choice but to make manufacturing work.

There are demands from at least some sections of the population for more income transfers. What is your opinion on this?

We have always been clear that we need a robust safety net. Ours is not some fuzzy socialist idea of inequality, but about directly addressing absolute poverty. Antyodaya (Anna Yojana) is the idea of helping people at the bottom of the pyramid. This government has done a lot of things for this segment so that they can have a life of dignity as well as contribute to the economy. Special efforts have been made to ensure the availability of toilets, gas, medical facilities, bank accounts and health insurance for the poor. Schemes like the PM Awas Yojana have allowed millions to access shelter. Niti Aayog‚Äôs recent report suggests that 135 million people were pulled out of extreme poverty between 2015-16 and 2019-21.

The country is now ranked fifth in the world behind the US, China, Germany and Japan.

Ahead of the 2024 general elections, Modi speaking at the new International Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre (IECC) complex, said that when his government took office in 2014, the Indian economy was at the tenth position and now has assumed the fifth position in the world. ‚ÄúWe have to achieve the target of making India a developed nation in the next 25 years,"" he said after unveiling a world-class convention centre in the heart of the national capital.

India can definitely eradicate poverty, he said citing a NITI Aayog report. ‚ÄúWe will make India a developed nation working on the principle of nation first, citizen first,"" he said inaugurating the complex which he renamed as Bharat Mandapam. He said that Bharat Mandapam, which will host the G20 summit in September under India‚Äôs presidency, will promote conference tourism. ‚ÄúWorld will witness rising stature of India when newly built Bharat Mandapam will host G20 summit,"" Modi said.

The IECC complex is India‚Äôs largest MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) destination. In terms of the covered space available for events, the complex finds its place among the top exhibition and convention complexes in the world. It comprises multiple modern facilities, including convention centres, exhibition halls and amphitheatres.

PM Modi said that today India is witnessing a revolution of rebuilding as in the last nine years, ‚Çπ34 trillion were spent on the creation of infrastructure. This year too, capital expenditure is kept at ‚Çπ10 trillion, he stated. He said that in the last nine years, electrification of 40,000 km of railway lines took place as compared to just 20,000 in the seven decades before that.

Rajeev Chandrasekhar , minister of state for electronics and information technology, told FT that despite India's crackdown on Chinese manufacturers and mobile applications, New Delhi is ""open to investment from China"".

Chandrasekar told The Financial Times that, ""We are open to doing business with any company anywhere as long as they are investing and conducting their business lawfully and are in compliance with the Indian laws"".

The FT quoted him saying, ""We are open to all investment, including Chinese"".

The development comes as National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval, in a stern message to China on the sidelines of the 13th BRICS, said the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has eroded the strategic trust between the two nations.

Notably, after the 2020 Galwan clash between India and China, the former tightened its policy on foreign investments from bordering countries which are required to seek central government approval.

India also banned more than a hundred Chinese mobile applications, including TikTok citing national security concerns after that incident.

Moreover, India also launched regulatory probes against Chinese mobile phone producers such as Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo claiming they violated foreign exchange laws.

However, the union minister argued that New Delhi did not just target China individually, the stringent measures also applied to other neighbouring countries such as Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh.

""The concept of trusted hardware, trusted equipment, and a trusted electronics ecosystem all came to the fore around that time.

The mission, numbered PSLV-C56, will deploy one primary and six additional satellites as part of the mission‚Äôs entire payload.

The primary payload for the mission is the Singapore government‚Äôs Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA)‚Äôs DS-SAR satellite, which will be used by Singapore government agencies for satellite imaging applications.

The mission comes just over three months after the previous PSLV mission, dubbed PSLV-C55, which deployed two satellites from Singapore in orbit. The latter were Singapore‚Äôs ‚ÄòTeLEOS-2‚Äô as the primary payload, and Lumelite-4 as secondary payload.

The six secondary payloads flying aboard the PSLV mission on 31 July include two technology demonstrator satellites Velox-Am and Scoob-II, an experimental satellite called Atmospheric Coupling and Dynamics Explorer (Arcade), private nanosatellite NuLIon, and two others‚ÄîGalassia-2 and Orb-12 Strider.

The PSLV-C56 mission for Isro and NSIL comes after the central space agency launched its third moon mission, Chandrayaan-3, on 14 July. The mission will seek to land a rover and a landing module in the lunar south pole‚Äîmaking India the first country in the world to do so. So far, China remains the only nation to have succeeded in landing on the moon in its first attempt‚ÄîIndia‚Äôs Chandrayaan-2 failed to land on the moon, four years ago. The Chandrayaan-3 mission, however, is different from NSIL‚Äôs commercial missions using the PSLV satellite-launching rocket. The mission is a part of India‚Äôs efforts to capture a larger share of the commercial satellite launch market.

The space is largely ruled so far by US, and prior to the Ukraine war, Russia.

In October last year, a report by industry body Indian Space Association (ISpA) and consultancy firm EY India projected India to become a $13 billion space economy by 2025, of which satellite launch services and applications would account for 36%‚Äîor over $4.5 billion.

NSIL is also developing the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) light rocket launcher, which is tipped to deploy small satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO).

Key features of the launcher include quick turnaround times between missions, on-demand services, and not needing clients to wait for other satellites to share the ride with. SSLV has so far completed one successful demonstrator mission, and is expected to conduct regular commercial missions within the next three years, Mint reported on 6 March.

Alongside NSIL, private space startups are also tipped to contribute to India‚Äôs space goals.

167,mint,Why India must change the way it taxes high-end cars,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/why-india-must-change-the-way-it-taxes-high-end-cars-11690097665954.html,23 Jul 2023,,"For most Indians travelling abroad for the first time, the sight of luxury cars like Mercedes Benzes or BMWs being operated as taxis comes as a bit of a shock. To find the preferred vehicles of the uber rich in India available for a regular cab ride serves as a humbling reminder of the true gap between ‚Äúus"" and ‚Äúthem.""

But the scenario could be very different if India were to rationalise the tax structure on what are considered ‚Äúluxury"" vehicles in India. If this were to happen, one could potentially see high-end foreign cars serving as Olas and Ubers.

Consider this. A Mercedes C300 retails for around ‚Ç¨41,000 in Germany and around $44,000 in the US. This works out to a little over ‚Çπ12 lakh in purchasing-power-parity (PPP) rupees ‚Äì a tad less than the entry price of a full sedan from Maruti or Honda in India (not the sub-four-metre ‚Äòcompact‚Äô sedan that‚Äôs unique to India).

Instead, a Mercedes C300 in India starts at over ‚Çπ65 lakh. The reason? Taxes. The import duty on cars ranges from 30-100% depending on whether the car is semi-knocked down or completely built. There is also 28% GST and a cess of 22%, which adds another 50% to the import price. Finally, there is the registration charge ‚Äì 15% of the ex-showroom price ‚Äì which ends up pushing what could have been a middle-class mover into the ultra-high net worth bracket.

Putting punitive levels of taxes on so-called ‚Äúluxury"" goods harks back to India‚Äôs socialist-era approach to taxation, where anything other than the bare necessities was considered a wasteful luxury in a country starved of resources and capital.

But India is no longer socialist, or poor. It is an upper-middle-income country, one of the world‚Äôs emerging economic superpowers. It also has, by all accounts, one of the world‚Äôs fastest-growing middle classes. According to a recent Deloitte study, India is set to become the world‚Äôs third-largest retail market behind the US and China by 2030. Its economy is projected to be the world's third-largest by 2030. By that year, India is set to add 110 million middle-income households (currently 190 million) and 14 million high-income households (currently 15 million) to the consumer base.

This new affluence is being spread more evenly. India will see a fivefold increase in ‚Äòsuper rich‚Äô families by the turn of the decade and a large chunk of the growth will come from rural areas. A July 2023 study by think tank PRICE estimates that the number of ‚Äúsuper rich"" households ‚Äì those earning more than ‚Çπ2 crore a year ‚Äì almost doubled to 1.8 million in five years to 2021. The growth of such households in villages was 14.2% compared to 10.6% in cities. By FY31, PRICE estimates the number of rich Indians ‚Äì defined as those earning more than ‚Çπ30 lakh a year ‚Äì at 169 million, with the middle class (income between ‚Çπ5-30 lakh a year ) adding another 715 million.

Rationalising taxes on what are considered ‚Äúluxury"" vehicles (quixotically defined by vehicle length and engine capacity, and not quality of build or fit and finish) has the potential to drive the creation of world class infrastructure in India. For starters, It will convert import and assembly operations into full-scale manufacturing, and create tens of thousands of jobs. Higher consumption driven by lower prices will more than make up for the treasury in volume what it loses by way of value under the current set up.

The base for such a potential jump in consumption has already been created. Highway construction is growing at a compound annual growth rate of 17%, with high-quality national highway networks rising by 59% in the past nine years. With high quality connectivity rising, so will the demand for transportation, particularly in rural India.

Then there is the export opportunity. Passenger vehicle exports from India rose 15% in FY23, with Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai accounting for a chunk of the 6.62 lakh units exported. These exports were mainly of small cars, which are manufactured at scale in India and therefore allow competitively priced exports. If sufficient scale were to be achieved in the current ‚Äúluxury"" UV/SUV segment, India could become an auto export powerhouse.

Finally, there is the safety argument. It is no secret that ‚Äúmade-in-India-sold-in-India"" vehicles lack several of the safety features and build quality found in similar models in developed markets (or indeed in the export versions of the same cars). Rationalising taxes and allowing consumer choice ‚Äì rather than tax-driven prices ‚Äì to determine what gets made at what scale will allow Indian consumers access to the only luxury that matters ‚Äì genuine choice."

The move to allow the use of India's currency would enable 'tourists and other people from India to directly use Indian rupees here' without going through the hassle of multiple currency conversions, said Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said Saturday.

According to official figures, the trade between the two nations stood at $5.45 billion in 2021. Sri Lanka imports plenty of items from India including food, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, automobiles, fertilizers, and chemicals.

Accepting the Indian rupee would work as an advantage for Sri Lanka as the trade imbalance between the two countries is in favor of India, Sabry said, ‚ÄúWe need more Indian currency, so more Indian people coming here and spending Indian currency is good for us.""

Earlier, Sri Lankan president Ranil Wickremesinghe visited India and during the visit, India and Sri Lanka signed a series of energy, development, and trade agreements, signaling growing economic ties between the neighboring countries.

In 2022, India provided critical financial and humanitarian assistance worth over $4 billion to its neighbor, including food, medicine, and fuel. Apart from this, India was also the first creditor to extend a letter of support towards Sri Lanka‚Äôs debt restructuring efforts that helped kickstart support from the IMF.

The ECTA with Sri Lanka will focus on tariff and non-tariff barriers as well as investment rules.

The development came during the visit of Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe to New Delhi.

The two countries agreed to operationalize India‚Äôs Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to ease digital payments across borders. Foreign secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters that the initiative could kick off in two to three months. Bhutan and Nepal have already adopted India‚Äôs signature digital payments platform.

New Delhi and Colombo also unveiled plans to establish power grid connectivity, possibly boosting electricity trade in the neighbourhood. According to the India-Sri Lanka Economic Partnership Vision released by the Ministry of External Affairs, this development ‚Äúhas the potential to not only bring down the costs of electricity in Sri Lanka but also help create a valuable and dependable source of foreign exchange for Sri Lanka.""

The two sides will also construct a multi-product petroleum pipeline for steady supplies to Sri Lanka. Last year, the island nation saw widespread fuel shortages as it grappled with a crippling economic crisis.

According to the vision document, New Delhi and Colombo will look to ‚Äúundertake mutually agreed joint exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Sri Lanka‚Äôs offshore basins with an aim to develop Sri Lanka‚Äôs upstream petroleum sector."" Besides this, work on the Sampur Solar power project and cooperation in emerging green technologies related to green hydrogen and green ammonia will also drive the partnership on renewable energy.

Both countries agreed to resume passenger ferry services between Nagapattinam in India and Kankesanthurai in Sri Lanka and will look to resume similar services in other locations. An expansion in air connectivity is also on the cards.

A key issue to watch will be the role played by Indian companies in Sri Lanka‚Äôs divestment programme. Colombo is looking to divest its stake in state-owned enterprises as part of a push to reform its economy. According to reports in Sri Lankan media, the Tata Group has been eyeing Sri Lankan Airlines, the state-owned carrier, which is in line for divestment. Tata Sons Chairman N. Chandrasekaran was in Sri Lanka prior to President Wickremesinghe‚Äôs visit and met with India‚Äôs High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Gopal Baglay. The economic partnership vision mentions India‚Äôs support for Sri Lanka‚Äôs divestment process.

Political issues also featured in the discussions when Wickremesinghe met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. The sensitive issue of the rights of Sri Lankan Tamils, which has been of particular concern to New Delhi, was discussed by the two leaders.

‚ÄúWe hope that the government of Sri Lanka will fulfil the aspirations of the Tamils. Will drive the process of rebuilding for equality, justice and peace. Will fulfill its commitment to implement the Thirteenth Amendment and conduct the Provincial Council Elections. And will ensure a life of respect and dignity for the Tamil community of Sri Lanka,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.

China‚Äôs military presence in the Indian Ocean and its use of Sri Lankan facilities for naval activities has been a key concern for New Delhi. India was upset by the presence of Chinese spy vessels, notably the Yuan Wang-5, which docked in Hambantota port in August 2022 despite Indian objections. Yuan Wang-6, another research vessel, entered the Indian Ocean even as India planned a test launch of its nuclear-capable Agni-ballistic missile. ‚ÄúWe are neighbours. We naturally have a very long-standing and comprehensive relationship. When the leaders of the two countries meet, it is very natural for them to speak about their concerns,"" Kwatra said. Discussions on these ‚Äúchallenges"", presumably related to China, were brought up during the meetings, he added.

‚ÄúThe Sri Lankan side did convey to us their sensitivity and respect for our security and strategic, sensitive concerns relating to what happens in our maritime domain,"" Kwatra concluded.

Wickremesinghe returned to Sri Lanka on Friday after his meetings with Prime Minister Modi and President Droupadi Murmu.

The country's forex kitty had reached an all-time high of $645 billion in October 2021. Following this, the reserves have been declining with RBI deploying the forex kitty to defend the rupee amid pressures caused majorly by global developments.

‚ÄúForeign exchange reserves have rebounded from $524.5 billion on October 21, 2022, and now stand in excess of $600 billion , taking into account our forward assets,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said earlier.

""Strong software services export growth was witnessed across key verticas such as IT services, business process management (BPM), and engineering research and design (ER&D), supported by a rise in global capability centres (GCCs),"" he added.

""A major portion of the week-on-week jump in Forex reserves is driven by revaluation gains due to dollar weakness and reduction in U.S. Treasury yields,"" said Gaura Sen Gupta, India economist at IDFC FIRST Bank.

171,mint,Franklin Templeton analysts upbeat on Indian market; here's why,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/franklin-templeton-analysts-believe-global-investors-should-pay-closer-attention-to-indian-market-heres-why-11689909132710.html,21 Jul 2023,,"Franklin Templeton‚Äôs analysts are upbeat about India's growth prospects. They think investors should bet on India because of its remarkable growth, supported by government policies, in many sectors including aviation, IT, energy, etc.

Dina Ting, CFA, who heads global index portfolio management at Franklin Templeton ETFs, believes India's growing middle class and supportive government programs have accelerated growth in many sectors, including aviation, IT and energy, putting the country among the leading economies of the world.

""A growing middle class means more robust travel demand and the South Asian nation‚Äôs booming airline business and aviation market is now one of the fastest growing in the world,"" Ting wrote in a note on July 20.

Ting underscored the rapid growth of the Indian aviation sector. ""Analysts expect related government spending to reach nearly $12 billion by 2025 to boost regional connectivity, with plans to modernise existing facilities as well as build 80 new airports over the coming five years,"" Ting said.

Ting highlighted an important development in June this year when Tata-owned Air India, which is already the country‚Äôs largest international carrier, confirmed a landmark commercial jet order of 470 Boeing and Airbus passenger aeroplanes which was Boeing‚Äôs second-largest aircraft order ever.

India shining

Ting highlighted that last year, projections for India‚Äôs rapid growth expectations set it apart as a frontrunner, due to its ability to diversify into more complex industries. As per India‚Äôs Ministry of Science and Technology, the country is also said to have the third-largest tech start-up ecosystem globally with increased levels of financing and investment support.

Ting also pointed out that recently the US and India have begun partnering more closely on several fronts, including defence manufacturing and technology innovation which has boosted the prospects of the country.

""We believe this makes it an opportune time to pay closer attention to India and the exchange-traded funds that can offer investors a low-cost and tax-efficient vehicle for tactical country allocations,"" said Ting.

""For those seeking broad exposure to the Indian economy, note that its equity market, as measured by the FTSE India RIC Capped Index, returned more than 13 per cent over the second quarter of 2023 as investors shrugged off the market‚Äôs weak start to the year.""

The recent mega-merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank has created the world‚Äôs fourth-largest bank. Ting sees it as a significant factor that helped the Indian market rally in the recent past.

Moreover, the formalisation of the Indian economy due to the introduction of goods and services tax (GST) and the growing digitisation of the economy is also a big positive.

""The rollout of the country‚Äôs goods and services tax (GST) and the growing digitisation of the economy are said to be bringing more people into the formal economy,"" said Ting.

""India began setting a solid foundation for a more digital economy over a decade ago with the launch of its national identification program, Aadhaar, which uses biometric IDs to establish proof of residence. This has yielded many social benefits and been instrumental in advancing digital financial inclusion.""

On the front of manufacturing, Ting believes if ""India is able to expand its skilled labour workforce, it may lure more manufacturing away from elsewhere in Asia, including China, where minimum wages tend to be higher and workers now demand more.""

Job creation remains a challenge but Ting pointed out that domestic demand has picked up.

""Indian consumers are also likely to have more disposable income, and as income distribution shifts, overall consumption can potentially see great increases. Goldman Sachs Research has projected India‚Äôs GDP will overtake the euro area‚Äôs in 2051 and America‚Äôs by 2075,"" Ting said.

She underscored that apart from notable infrastructure buildout, financial sector growth and a vast and diverse population, India‚Äôs remarkable progress toward transitioning to clean energy is another appealing consideration for investors.

She highlighted that the World Bank recently approved $1.5 billion in financing to accelerate the development of India‚Äôs low-carbon energy sector. In addition, the International Energy Agency expects India to surpass Canada and China in the coming years to rank as the world‚Äôs third-largest ethanol market after the United States and Brazil.

The video highlights the leaked data from a 2017-18 consumer expenditure survey, which suggests a potential rise in national poverty rates. However, the government's response to this data has been controversial, raising questions about the accuracy and transparency of India's poverty measurements. The video delves into the complexities of measuring poverty in a developing economy like India and the political sensitivity around poverty numbers. We discuss the official poverty lines based on consumer expenditure surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey and the growing divergence between survey estimates and national accounts. The video also highlights the trade-offs between comparability and accuracy in survey design and the importance of transparency in India's statistical establishment.

174,mint,Higher inflation could require more monetary policy tightening: IMF chief,https://www.livemint.com/economy/higher-inflation-could-require-more-monetary-policy-tightening-imf-chief-11689680749203.html,18 Jul 2023,,"Gandhinagar: With economic activity slowing, especially in the manufacturing sector, medium-term growth prospects globally could remain weak, and higher inflation could require more monetary policy tightening, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said at the G20 summit on Tuesday.

""The global economy has shown some resilience. Despite successive shocks in recent years and the rapid rise in interest rates, global growth‚Äîalthough anemic by historical standards‚Äîremains firmly in positive territory, supported by strong labor markets and robust demand for services,"" Georgieva said at the third meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG).

""That said, activity is slowing, especially in the manufacturing sector. Looking further ahead, medium-term growth prospects remain weak,"" she added in a statement.

In its latest World Economic Outlook report, released in April, IMF had projected the Indian economy to grow by 5.9% for calendar year (CY) 2023, and 6.3% during CY 2024, making it the fastest-growing economy in the world.

According to the IMF, the baseline global forecast is for growth to fall from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in CY 2023, before settling at 3% in CY 2024. Advanced economies are expected to see an especially pronounced growth slowdown, from 2.7% in CY 2022 to 1.3% in CY 2023.

""Inflation could remain higher for longer, requiring even more monetary policy tightening, and fragmentation could weigh even more on growth,"" Georgieva said

""But headline inflation is still too high and core inflation remains sticky despite the significant monetary policy tightening,"" Georgieva said in the statement.

""Elevated food and fertilizer prices are particularly worrying, especially for low-income households for which food insecurity and malnutrition are now much more persistent,"" she added.

India's retail inflation, which cooled steadily for four months, leapt to a higher-than-expected 4.81% in June, driven by rising food and vegetable prices.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had left the repo rate unchanged at 6.50%.

Georgieva said that G20 leaders should seize the opportunity to move the global economy onto a more vibrant medium-term path to mitigate the risks, which would require both domestic and international policy action.

She emphasized that events like climate change, pandemics, and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine are causing widespread turmoil.

""To protect the most vulnerable countries and their people, we need to strengthen the global financial safety net,"" she said.

""While advanced and strong emerging market economies have a cushion of more than $10 trillion in international reserves, the rest of the world relies on pooled resources of international institutions such as the IMF,"" she added.

India's per capita income is currently estimated at $2,500, while it must be more than $21,664 by 2047, as per World Bank standards, to be classified as a high-income country.

It must be noted that as per World Bank classification, a country with a per capita income of US$ 13,205 or more in 2022-23 is classified as a high-income country.

The report further said ""To achieve this target, the required real GDP compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for India works out to be 7.6% during 2023-24 to 2047-48.""

The report said to become an high-income country by 2047-48, India‚Äôs per capita GDP in nominal terms would have to record a CAGR of 10.6% (9.1%). It may, however, be mentioned that the best India achieved over a period of consecutive 25 years in the past is a CAGR of 8.1% during 1993-94 to 2017-18.

It may be stated that India must surpass its preceding record to achieve the nominal per capita GDP of 9.1% growth target.

To sustain growth over the next 25 years, India must rebalance its economic structure by strengthening its industrial sector which has strong backward and forward linkages. Besides providing employment opportunities, a wider industrial sector would mean that India would be able to meet domestically the increasing demand from the burgeoning population.

Accordingly, it is expected that India‚Äôs industrial sector should increase its share from the current 25.6% to 35% by 2047-48 with manufacturing occupying a 25% share in total value added.

This would require the industrial sector to grow at a nominal CAGR of 13.4%.

Given India‚Äôs comparative advantage in services exports, if it manages to sustain the growth in exports of goods and services (nominal) at 13.3% over the next 25 years (as observed during the high growth phase of 1993-2017), their share in GDP would increase from 22.8% in 2022-23 to 30.5% by 2047-48.

Going forward, the share of agriculture would have to come down with the rise in the share of services as observed in advanced economies. Accordingly, agriculture would have to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% and the services sector by 13% in the coming 25 years to have a sectoral share of 5% and 60 %, respectively, by 2047-48.

For realising these growth targets, India needs a development strategy focusing on sustained economic growth with structural change. Along with achieving high per capita income, the goal should be to accomplish all-round development ensuring quality of growth and sustainability in the use of natural resources.

The survey findings revealed that the growth momentum witnessed in the previous fiscal year has continued into subsequent quarters. In the fourth quarter (January-March) of FY23, 55% of respondents reported higher production levels.

Going ahead, more than 57% of manufacturers surveyed anticipate increased production levels in the first quarter (April-June) of 2023-24, with a modest single-digit average growth rate.

The survey also signalled positive demand conditions, with 58% of respondents reporting a higher number of orders in the first quarter.

Ficci‚Äôs quarterly survey analysed sentiments across nine major sectors, including automotive & auto components, capital goods & construction equipment, cement, chemicals fertilizers and pharmaceuticals, electronics & white goods, machine tools, metal & metal products, textiles, apparels & technical textiles, toys & handicrafts, and miscellaneous.

The survey garnered responses from more than 400 manufacturing units, encompassing both large and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with a combined annual turnover exceeding Rs. 7.70 lakh crore.

The survey also indicated an optimistic outlook for demand conditions, particularly in the domestic market, in the second quarter (July-September) of fiscal 2023-24. This positive sentiment reinforces the overall positive outlook for Indian manufacturing.

The recent additions of experienced professionals in key positions reflect the company's commitment to transformative changes. Furthermore, Kotak aims to grow its internal talent pool, ensuring readiness for the future.

Here are some of the points Kotak highlighted in his last annual letter:

In the last one year alone, we have onboarded a new CTO, a Chief of Customer Experience, a Head of Brand, Product and Marketing and a Chief of Retail and Commercial Risk to drive potentially transformative changes in each of these areas. At the same time we will grow internal talent, which is future ready.

I would like us to pursue the Indian dream of a USD 30 trillion economy and unshackle the financial sector in a nuanced manner towards optimum regulation. The Finance Minister has identified the issues in her 2023 Budget speech Para- 99 that seeks to bring feasible public consultation into the process of regulation making and Para-100 that targets a comprehensive review of existing regulations to ease and cut down the cost of compliance. I look forward to seeing progress on that.

Moving to the big picture. Geo-politics dominates the world economics and India has indeed played its cards well. From oil diplomacy which has given India access to cheaper oil to a strategic positioning among the US, Russia and China, India has pivoted herself to be a key player for Europe, the Middle East, Japan and Australia as well.

Indian economy in a sweet spot, good time for bold thinking: Indian macro is in good shape. So is the micro. At this stage, a virtuous cycle for India is on the cards. Our financial sector is in its Goldilocks period. Clock striking midnight seems far away for Cinderella. Hence, this is the time to ask ourselves the tough questions. What are we doing for a USD 30 trillion economy by 2047 when India completes 100 years of Independence? Our financial sector needs significant capacity building for this aspiration.

I feel the financial sector players risk becoming more robotic, curbing the entrepreneurial flair since the fear of making a mistake overrides the joy of creation and development. While we need ‚ÄòArjuna‚Äôs eye‚Äô on risk management, we must prevent bureaucratisation of financial services.

The optimism is well reflected in our full-year numbers too, especially in our growth in profits, margins and asset quality standards. In FY 2022-23, our Net Profit at the consolidated level witnessed a 23% YoY growth to ‚Çπ 14,925 crore. The Return on Assets (ROA) at the consolidated level was 2.62% for FY 2022-23 (2.36% for FY 2021-22). Our Bank Standalone Net Interest Margin (NIM) stood at 5.33% (up 72 bps against FY 2021-22) and our Net Profit witnessed a 28% YoY growth to ‚Çπ 10,939 crore.

Reflecting our conviction and commitment to growth, we grew our Net Advances in the year by 18% YoY of which our unsecured retail advances book (including retail microfinance) forms 10% of Net Advances as on 31st March, 2023. Our CASA stood at 52.8%, Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) at 21.8% with CET1 at 20.6%.

As on 31st March, 2023, the total Assets Under Management (AUM) for Kotak Group was more than ‚Çπ 4,20,800 crore with our alternate assets book showing a growth of about 125% YoY at ‚Çπ 46,077 crore (Include undrawn commitments, wherever applicable).

We were at the right place at the right time. We are a quintessential product of the India growth story and the financial sector evolution. We have created value for stakeholders and now provide ~100,000 direct jobs and a multiple of that in indirect jobs. An investor who invested ‚Çπ 10,000 with us in 1985 would be worth ~ ‚Çπ 300 crore today. Most importantly, we have built an institution, on the basic tenets of trust and transparency.

Going forward, I see my role as a non-executive board governance member and a strategic shareholder with a long term perspective of nurturing a world class institution. It is unusual in today‚Äôs world of banking anywhere to have an individual with ~26% skin in the game with disproportionate family assets in one stock, emotionally attached to living his dream of making India proud.

I end with my favourite quote from George Bernard Shaw: ‚ÄúThe reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.""

In conclusion he said, in order to build a sustainable institution for the future, Kotak recognizes the importance of product excellence, customer obsession, and trust. The company has already embarked on a mindset shift, moving from the physical to the ""phygital"" world, and now leaping towards a ""digical"" approach. This journey involves living with conflicting emotions of paranoia and excitement, as they navigate the ever-evolving landscape of technology and artificial intelligence.

Looking at the data, the retail inflation was higher than both the revised 4.31 percent for the previous month and the 4.58 percent expected in a Reuters poll of 55 economists.

Apart from the retail inflation, the food inflation also surged to 4.49 percent against a revised 2.96 percent in May.

Citing the reason for the rise in inflation, experts say erratic and incessant rainfall in northern India may have pushed vegetable prices higher and it is most likely to rise further in coming months.

ICRA's economist Aditi Nayar said, as quoted by Reuters, ""A less supportive base and the onset of the spike in vegetable prices pushed up the CPI inflation to a higher than anticipated 4.8%.""

Prices of vegetables will remain high in July and may push retail inflation to an ""uncomfortable 5.3%-5.5%"" this month, Nayar added.

Earlier, reports arrive that fast food chain McDonald's dropped tomatoes from its burgers and wraps in many areas of India citing its rising prices.

On the other side, Emkay Global Financial Services' lead economist Madhavi Arora opined that the sharp sequential uptick in food-led Inflation could spill over till August.

She said to Mint, ‚ÄúThe sharp sequential uptick in food-led Inflation could spill over till August, implying pressure on headline print will stay. There isn't much RBI can do in the food supply management but this adds pressure on them to stay vigilant on domestic dynamics. Global externalities have already pressed them to signal wait-and-watch guidance and the transient food spike will only complicate their reaction function.""

Similar views were expressed by Knight Frank India's Director of Research Vivek Rathi. He said, ""Consumer inflation in June 2023 increased primarily due to food components of cereals, milk items, and spices, while inflationary pressures from fuel have largely moderated. In the coming months, an increase in certain food products, particularly vegetables, and fruits, is expected to contribute to inflationary pressures. However, the stability of the rupee and firm import inflation, along with wholesale prices should help balance consumer price growth. The overall low inflation level supports the argument for maintaining key policy rates in the upcoming RBI policy meeting.""

Meanwhile, the core inflation remained below 6 percent for a fourth consecutive month. Economists estimate core inflation was between 5.1 percent and 5.4 percent in June, compared with 5.02 percent in May.

In June, the RBI kept its rates on hold for the second straight meeting, saying it would focus on anchoring inflation close to 4 percent, the mid-point of its 2%-6% target range.

Expressing concern over the CPI data, Ladderup Wealth Management's MD Raghvendra Nath said, ""In June, India experienced a surge in retail inflation, with the CPI rising to 4.81%, breaking a four-month trend of decline following May's rate of 4.31%. The primary driver behind this inflationary spike can be attributed to an increase in food prices. Notably, the provisional figure of 4.88% exceeded the market expectation of 4.60% as per the Bloomberg Survey.""

""Although the inflation rate remains below the upper threshold of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) target of 6%, the upward trend raises cautionary flags regarding the potential impact of the monsoon season and El-Nino, as well as its implications for the timing and anticipation of interest rate cuts by the central bank,"" he added.

183,mint,Global recession fears: What sets India's economy apart from the rest?,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/global-recession-fears-what-sets-indias-economy-apart-from-the-rest-11689143886859.html,12 Jul 2023,,"Indian equities have been upbeat as foreign institutional investors have remained net buyers of local shares since March. The Indian economy seems relatively better placed than peers amid fears of a global recession and more interest rate hikes by central banks of developed economies.

A series of high-frequency indicators, such as manufacturing data, capex from state and central governments, and tax receipts, both direct and indirect, have seen an uptick recently. These all bolster the health and promise of India's economic landscape, but what makes it outperform other Asian markets?

‚ÄúWe believe there is a key driver at the heart of this exuberance - lower commodity prices. Oil alone has an impressive sensitivity to growth,"" said economists at HSBC Global Research in a recent report. ‚ÄúWe find that for every USD10/barrel fall in oil prices, gross domestic product (GDP) growth rises by 0.2ppt. Oil prices averaged cUSD100/b in FY23. If it remains at the current level of cUSD75/b, that would imply a $25/b fall in prices, leading to a 0.5ppt increase in growth,"" added the report.

And that‚Äôs not all. According to Gaura Sen Gupta, economist at IDFC First Bank, India‚Äôs current account deficit (CAD) is likely to narrow as crude oil prices remain subdued in FY24. She has forecast FY24 CAD to fall to 1.8% of GDP from 2.0% in FY23.

As India is a net importer of crude oil, diminished prices will also cause microeconomic ripples, potentially improving corporate margins. Analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd anticipate the Ebitda margin for companies under their coverage (excluding Oil & Gas and Financials) to swell 80 basis points year-on-year to 19.1%. Similarly, Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margin for Nifty companies (excluding OMC and Financials) is expected to broaden 110 basis points year-on-year to 20.8% in the quarter.

However, the growth momentum faces potential domestic threats like El Nino, which could negatively impact food inflation and rural demand. The recent rise in vegetable prices also warrants monitoring.

‚ÄúMonsoon distribution remains uneven which has resulted in a surge in vegetable prices in July. If current trend holds then July CPI inflation could rise to ~6% versus 4.6% expected in June. For the full year FY24 inflation is expected at 5.2% (revised-up from 5.0%),"" added the IDFC report."
184,mint,India rises up the ranks in global m-cap race,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/india-rises-up-the-ranks-in-global-m-cap-race-11689095383338.html,12 Jul 2023,,"India‚Äôs stock market has outperformed most large markets over the last three years. This has raised its share in global market capitalization, breaking into the top five in March 2022 by overtaking the UK. However, the ranking dropped after allegations of corporate malfeasance at the Adani Group in January 2023. Since then, both the Adani Group to some extent, and the Indian stock market significantly, have recovered. Foreign portfolio investors have been net buyers in Indian equities since March, pumping in $6.7 billion last month. India has now regained its top five spot (last week, the BSE‚Äôs m-cap hit the ‚Çπ300 trillion mark).

While a share in global market cap will reflect the vagaries of the stock market and its relative performance to other markets, the long-term trend is unmistakable. India‚Äôs share rose from 1.6% in 2006 (and the historical average of 2.6%) to 3.3% this June. Its increase was driven by a rise in stock prices‚Äîthe Sensex jumped from 10,000 in July 2006 to over 65,000 now‚Äîand also by new listings.

In the long term, India‚Äôs share in global market cap is likely to increase further, but remain smaller than the US and China, reflecting the relative size of these economies. The nature of the market is expected to change too. In the US, the top five companies by market capitalization are tech companies. A 2021 Goldman Sachs report pointed out that ‚ÄúIndia is among the ‚Äòoldest‚Äô in the region, with the average listing age exceeding 20 years versus 9 years for China"". The questions around overvaluations are expected to continue.

Overvaluation drag

India's market capitalization might already be overvalued by the Buffett Indicator, or market capitalization-to-GDP ratio. Named after fabled investor Warren Buffett, it is used to assess how expensive or cheap the aggregate stock market is at a given point in time. According to an analysis by Motilal Oswal Financial Services in April 2023, at 95% at the end of 2022-23, the indicator was higher than its historical average of 81%. However, since it depends on the market prices of stocks, it can be volatile. In recent times, the ratio moved between 56% (at the end of 2019-20) and 112% (at the end of 2021-22).

The key idea behind the Buffett Indicator is that market capitalization is ultimately tied to a country's economic performance. The optimism about the Indian economy is tempered by macroeconomic concerns, including high inflation globally, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the Chinese slowdown. While India gained tactical advantages, its long-term growth would depend on its ability to attract long-term investments.

IPO boom

Besides an organic increase in share prices, a growth in market cap will also come from new companies listing on public markets, as tech companies like Zomato and Paytm did in 2021. In the last 10 years, there have been an average of 99 initial public offers, with companies raising an average of about $5.27 billion each year, according to Prime Database. Since market capitalization only includes listed companies, the greater the number of IPOs, the higher the capitalization.

One of the key drivers of IPOs will be the private equity (PE) market, including venture capital (VC) investments, which are primarily aimed at exits through strategic sales or public listing. According to Bain & Co's India Private Equity Report 2023, 38% of PE/VC exits by value happened through public market sales in 2022. The numbers were 32% and 48%, in 2021 and 2020, respectively. PE/VC investments are expected to increase the representation of new economy companies.

Market marathon

In the longer run, India is expected to increase its global market cap share to 8% in 2050, and 12% in 2075, according to Goldman Sachs. This will be a part of a broader shift in share to emerging markets, whose share is projected to grow from around 27% currently to 35% in 2030, 47% in 2050 and 55% in 2075. In India's case, an extra push will come from its favourable demographic outlook and rapid growth in GDP per capita.

By 2050, India is expected to be the third largest economy, behind China and the US, from fifth at present, according to Goldman Sachs forecasts. Within emerging markets, China‚Äôs relative share is expected to decline to about 30% in 2050 from 40% now, while India‚Äôs is projected to rise from 12% to 17%. While market capitalization tends to be volatile, the long-term direction seems to be upwards.

185,mint,Create more competitive jobs to drive the Indian economy ahead,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/create-more-competitive-jobs-to-drive-the-indian-economy-ahead-11689088996985.html,11 Jul 2023,,"Manufacturing has been the backbone of many economies. India has for a long time pondered ways to ramp up manufacturing in the country. In recent years, there have been sincere and potent attempts at doing this. The government‚Äôs ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô initiative, production-linked incentive schemes for 14 key sectors with an outlay of ‚Çπ1.97 trillion, Industrial Corridor Development Programme and National Logistics Policy, among others, have been successful in achieving their respective goals. The fact that rapid growth in services preceded quick expansion of India‚Äôs manufacturing sector, unlike what tends to be the case in most other countries, is an oft-repeated observation.

Given this scenario, India‚Äôs vigorous manufacturing push is timely and well needed. The traditional view has held the manufacturing sector as holding immense job creation potential to absorb surplus labour that is otherwise employed in agriculture. Its potential has also stemmed from its ability to absorb low-skilled labour for labour-intensive work. Hence India has placed emphasis on manufacturing industries to create a growing pool of jobs. The country has undertaken significant work on this. We must complement these efforts, however, with a focus on the creation of competitive jobs.

Competitive jobs are best defined as those that provide pathways to higher productivity and enable individuals to earn their own livelihoods and become self-reliant. Competitive jobs don‚Äôt just assure employees wages in the marketplace, they also provide opportunities for people to develop capabilities that can enhance productivity over time. These jobs are extremely important because a focus on developing the capabilities of workers and improving their productivity is key to unlocking long-term economic growth. To quote economist Paul Krugman in this context, ‚ÄúThe capacity of a country to improve its standard of living through time depends almost entirely on its capacity to increase output per worker."" By not allowing stagnation in an individual‚Äôs capacity and by offering instead an environment conducive to raising the economic value added by each worker, competitive jobs can prove transformative when generated at scale across an economy.

A large chunk of employment in India comes from informal spaces of work. Informality and irregularity in employment restricts the scope to enhance human capital and improve performance over time. It has a stifling effect on worker capacity, with limited incentives to invest in assets that would drive productivity. The International Labour Organization‚Äôs World Employment and Social Outlook 2023 report considers productivity as ‚Äúkey to addressing today‚Äôs multiple crises"".

India has unmatched potential to be a driver of high productivity on a global scale. In 2020, India was home to 900 million people in the working-age bracket, and the country will add more than 100 million by 2030. Our working-age population is growing by roughly 10 million annually, and is expected to exceed China‚Äôs working-age population in total numbers. This explains why a discussion on our demographic dividend and need to make the most of it, as efficiently as possible, has been gaining ground. On the other hand, a digital revolution has been transforming lives and livelihoods across the country. Both these trends together can be foundational for a more productive India.

Conditions are ripe. India‚Äôs total telephone subscriber base stood at 1,178 million in 2022, with 44.3% of these subscribers located in rural India. In January 2023, around 8 billion transactions worth nearly $200 billion were carried out on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

Digitization and a burgeoning youth population can together be utilized to create more competitive jobs. As the changing nature of jobs reshapes the terrain of work, India can focus on two aspects. One is to invest in human capital that is yet to enter the labour market, and the other is to make productivity enhancement a continuous process for those active in the labour market.

An able workforce is just one side of the coin. Our competitive job-creation imperative also depends on gross domestic product growth acceleration. According to McKinsey‚Äôs analysis in 2020, to cater to growing employment needs, net employment would need to grow by 1.5% per year from 2023 to 2030 while maintaining productivity growth at 6.5-7.0% per year.

There are significant efforts underway to map our journey towards India‚Äôs centennial year. Amrit Kaal will be a reality not just on the back of any one defined pathway, but multiple pathways that complement each other and amplify the overall positive impact. So, even as we aim to boost manufacturing, our focus should be on the creation of competitive jobs.

In the long run, it will hold India in good stead to abandon the perception of a dichotomy between service and manufacturing sector jobs‚Äîto be replaced by the encouragement of competitive jobs across all sectors that make up our economy."

Sensex and Nifty are trading near their all-time high levels and experts believe despite some correction in the near term, the market will give healthy returns in the medium to long term.

Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher has a 12-month base case target of 21,430 for Nifty50. In a bull case scenario, the brokerage firm expects the Nifty to reach the level of 24,353 and in a bear case, the Nifty's target is 18,264 in the next 12 months.

""India continues to be the epitome of global growth with over 6.5 per cent expected GDP growth for FY24 (highest globally) even as growth is slowing down in US and Europe is embracing recession. India has witnessed a revival in FII inflows (strong global markets) and we expect the same to sustain a post-$23 billion outflow in the last two years and a decline in FII ownership by 300 bps to 20.3 per cent,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher.

""Rural India is showing green shoots post and soft inflation and favourable monsoons can accelerate demand further in a pre-election year. We remain positive on auto, banks, capital goods, hospitals, discretionary consumption and building materials. El Nino and the 2024 elections remain a key risk.

Experts suggest buying quality stocks at this juncture to reap the benefits of the Indian market's bright prospects. We picked five stocks suggested by brokerage firms Motilal Oswal and HDFC Securities that you can buy for the next three-four quarters. Take a look:

Brokerage firm: Motilal Oswal Financial Services

Tata Motors | Target price: ‚Çπ 700

The brokerage firm believes Tata Motors should witness a healthy recovery as supply-side issues ease (for JLR) and commodity headwinds stabilise (for the India business).

""It will benefit from (a) CV upcycle and stable growth in PVs, (b) company-specific volume/margin drivers, and (c) a sharp improvement in FCF and leverage in both JLR as well as the India business,"" Motilal Oswal said.

As per the brokerage firm, the stock trades at 19.3 times/16.2 times FY24E/FY25E consolidated P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) and 5 times/4.2 times EV/EBITDA.

Varun Beverages | Target price: ‚Çπ 700

Motilal believes Varun Beverages' focus on adjacent categories such as dairy-based beverages, sports drinks, energy drinks and juices will sustain the strong growth momentum.

""We expect Varun Beverages to maintain its earnings momentum, underpinned by: (1) higher demand for its products, on the back of a prolonged summer season, soaring temperatures and heat waves, (2) higher acceptance of newly launched products, including the dairy-based beverages, (3) increased penetration in newly acquired territories of South and West India, and (4) growing refrigeration in rural and semi-rural areas,"" said Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage firm expects a revenue, EBITDA and PAT CAGR of 17 per cent, 19 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively, over 2022-25.

Brokerage firm: HDFC Securities

Welspun Enterprises | Base case target price: ‚Çπ 247.4 | Bull case target price: ‚Çπ 273.65

HDFC Securities said Welspun Enterprises is one of the key beneficiaries of increasing government focus on the greenfield expressway projects that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is focusing on.

Its focus on margins and cash flow generation augurs well from a long-term perspective.

Over the years, the company has transformed itself into one of the leading EPC contractors and has grown its order book and revenue at a healthy rate with good margins.

Welspun Enterprises has also calibrated diversification to continue the growth momentum, without assuming the concentration risk, leading to superior scalability and recognition. Robust execution capabilities coupled with a strong repository of asset base enabling efficient execution would reflect strong revenue growth.

""Welspun Enterprises has strong financials and a healthy balance sheet as compared to its peer companies which give the company a competitive advantage in bidding for new bulky projects. Its continued focus on adding and diversifying project portfolio at healthy margins reinforces our positive view on the company,"" HDFC Securities said.

""We expect revenue, EBITDA, and PAT to grow at a CAGR of 16 per cent, 28 per cent, and 20 per cent, respectively, over FY23‚Äì25E. We think the base case fair value of the stock is ‚Çπ247.4 and the bull case fair value is ‚Çπ273.65 over the next three-four quarters. Investors can buy the stock in the band of ‚Çπ222-228 and add more on dips to ‚Çπ195-201 band,"" said HDFC Securities.

Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) | Base case target price: ‚Çπ 65 | Bull case target price: ‚Çπ 71

HDFC Securities pointed out HUDCO has off late ventured into corporate lending activities for urban infrastructure including power, lending to Gridcos in states.

""We expect the loan book of the company to grow at a conservative CAGR of nearly 8 per cent over FY23-FY25E. PAT is expected to grow at 11.4 per cent CAGR on account of, stable spreads and contained credit costs. Most of the concerns seem to be reflected in the price and the stock is available at an inexpensive valuation and offers an attractive dividend yield (FY23 dividend ‚Çπ3.85),"" HDFC Securities said.

""We believe investors can buy the stock in the band of ‚Çπ58-59 and add on dips in ‚Çπ52-53 band (0.63 times FY25E ABV) for base case fair value of ‚Çπ65 (0.78 times FY25E ABV) and bull case fair value of ‚Çπ71 (0.85 times FY25E ABV) in the next 2-3 quarters,"" said the brokerage firm.

NLC India | Base case target price: ‚Çπ 118 | Bull case target price: ‚Çπ 130

NLC reported encouraging H2FY23 (second half of FY23) numbers. Given the expansion of the company in coal-based thermal plants, coal mining and significant renewable capacity addition, NLC is expected to continue to do well.

Increasing electricity demand and power reforms undertaken by the government provide a stable business environment. The company is expected to exhibit considerable revenue and PAT growth from its existing level.

""We expect revenue, EBITDA and PAT to increase at a CAGR of 13 per cent, 14 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively, over FY23-25E. We think the base case fair value of the stock is ‚Çπ118 (7.3 times FY25E EPS and 0.9 times FY25E BV) and the bull case fair value is ‚Çπ130 (8 times FY25E EPS and one time FY25E BV) over the next three-four quarters. Investors can buy the stock in the band of ‚Çπ106 ‚Äì 109 (6.6 times FY25E EPS and 0.8x FY25E BV) and add more on dips in the band of ‚Çπ97 - 99 (6 times FY25E EPS and 0.75 times FY25E BV),"" said HDFC Securities.

188,mint,"Fed likely to lift rates on July 26; how can it impact the market, rupee?",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/fed-likely-to-lift-rates-on-july-26-how-can-it-impact-the-market-rupee-11688993335396.html,10 Jul 2023,,"The US Fed, like many of its global counterparts, has been working hard to bring inflation sustainably down since last year. But it doesn't seem like the Fed's fight against inflation will stop anytime soon. The US Federal Reserve, most probably, will increase interest rates by 25 basis points on July 26, and they may do another increase before the end of this year.

During their policy meeting in June, the US Fed decided to keep the benchmark federal funds rate steady within a range of 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent. If the Fed decides to raise the rate again at their meeting on July 25-26, it would, as per reports, reach the highest level seen in 22 years.

In June, the Federal Reserve decided to take a break from raising interest rates to assess the effects of the previous 10 consecutive rate hikes. However, analysts have observed that the Fed can't afford to keep pausing for too long because, even though inflation and the job market in the US are cooling, they are not cold enough for the Fed to relax its fight against inflation.

How can Fed rate hike impact the Indian market, the Indian rupee?

Rate hikes are bad news for the stock market. But as the market is already expecting it, it may not give a strong jolt to sentiment.

""Another 50-basis point rate hike by the Federal Reserve seems to be already factored in by the financial markets. Consequently, the likely 25 bps rate hikes in each of the next two policy meetings are unlikely to result in a significant change in either the Indian equity market or the external value of the rupee. In contrast, if the extent of rate change by the Federal Reserve is either higher or lower than the current expectations, that can move the market considerably,"" said Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist and Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

A more hawkish Fed, however, can deal a blow to the market.

Shey Jain, CEO and Founder of SAS Online believes the market's reaction to rate hikes can vary as it depends on factors such as the timing and magnitude of the hikes, as well as market expectations leading up to the decision.

""The impact on the Indian market and the rupee can be significant. Firstly, a rate hike by the US Fed can result in capital outflows from emerging markets like India, as investors may seek higher returns in the US. This outflow of capital can exert downward pressure on the Indian stock market. Secondly, a rate hike can lead to an appreciation of the US dollar against major currencies, including the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar can make imports costlier for India and impact the country's current account deficit. Moreover, if the rupee depreciates against the dollar, it can increase the cost of servicing India's external debt, which is mostly denominated in US dollars,"" said Jain.

Jateen Trivedi, VP of Research at LKP Securities believes the further rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve will create volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets. This can impact investor sentiment, potentially leading to increased market volatility in India as well.

Trivedi said the rupee will see a weak trend on any price rise and will keep taking resistance until there is a final figure on rate pause and the Fed hints of a rate cut.

The market and the Indian currency may see some volatility after the Fed increases rates but it is unlikely that there will be a deep selloff in Indian stocks and currency as the domestic market's outlook remains robust for the medium to long term.

Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities pointed out that the Indian equity markets so far have not seen any adverse effect of the rate hikes in the US even as the RBI may continue its pause mode. However, it is not known at what point will rate hikes impact the global risk appetite.

Jasani is of the view that if a rate hike impacts global sentiment, it could have a negative effect on Indian equity markets too.

As far as the Indian rupee is concerned, Jasani said the widening rate differential between India and US could bring some more pressure on the rupee. However, so far, the constant FPI flows have mitigated this to an extent. The rupee could reverse its trajectory if the US dollar index starts to weaken due to worries about its economy, said Jasani.

According to Invesco Global Sovereign Asset Management Study published on Monday, more than 85% of the 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks that took part in the annual survey believe that inflation will now be higher in the coming decade than in the last.

A central bank in the West noted, ‚ÄúI think that inflation will not return to where it was in the last five years. The main question mark is how sticky it is. In the past it has been surprising how persistent inflation can be.""

As per the survey, sovereign money managers are ‚Äòfundamentally‚Äô rethinking their strategies on the belief that higher inflation and geopolitical tensions will prevail.

Gold and emerging market bonds are seen as good bets in that environment, but last year's freezing of almost half of Russia's $640 billion of gold and forex reserves by the West in response to the invasion of Ukraine also appears to have triggered a shift, Reuters reported.

The survey showed a ""substantial share"" of central banks were concerned by the precedent that had been set. Almost 60% of respondents said it had made gold more attractive, while 68% were keeping reserves at home compared to 50% in 2020.

‚ÄúWe did have it (gold) held in London... but now we've transferred it back to own country to hold as a safe haven asset and to keep it safe,"" quoted one central bank.

The study revealed a broadened appetite for Emerging Markets among sovereign investors. Respondents sought new sources of diversification and higher returns across emerging Asia, Latin America and Africa

The respondents commended Emerging Markets‚Äô resilience amidst rapidly increasing interest rates ‚Äì a contrast to previous crises such as the 2013 taper tantrum ‚Äì indicating institutional strength has steadily improved over the last decade.

Meanwhile, the survey shows India exemplifies the attributes sought by sovereign investors.

Viewed increasingly positively for its improved business and political stability, favourable demographics, regulatory initiatives, and a friendly environment for sovereign investors, India has now overtaken China as the most attractive Emerging Market for investing in Emerging Market debt, the survey said.

A development sovereign based in the Middle East noted, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have enough exposure to India or China. However, India is a better story now in terms of business and political stability. Demographics are growing fast, and they also have interesting companies, good regulation initiatives, and a very friendly environment for sovereign investors.""

India is among a number of countries, including Mexico and Brazil, that are benefitting from increased foreign corporate investment aimed at both domestic and international demand through ‚Äúfriend-shoring"" and ‚Äúnear-shoring"".

This was seen as helping fund current account deficits as well as support currencies and domestic assets including debt. Expectations for peaking inflation and a completion of the Emerging Markets tightening cycle was also playing a role in this trend, the study said.

Moreover, geopolitical concerns, combined with opportunities in emerging markets, are also encouraging some central banks to diversify away from the dollar.

A growing 7% believe rising US debt is also a negative for the greenback, although most still see no alternative to it as the world's reserve currency. Those that see China's yuan as a potential contender fell to 18%, from 29% last year.

Nearly 80% of the 142 institutions surveyed see geopolitical tensions as the biggest risk over the next decade, while 83% cited inflation as a concern over the next 12 months, Reuters reported.

Meanwhile, infrastructure is now seen as the most attractive asset class, particularly those projects involving renewable energy generation.

190,mint,‚ÄòBusiness confidence improved in June qtr‚Äô,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/business-confidence-improves-in-new-delhi-gst-collections-and-passenger-traffic-support-optimism-in-private-investments-11688926114323.html,09 Jul 2023,,"New Delhi: Business confidence has improved sequentially in April-June, reaffirming the positive trends in economic activity like goods and services tax (GST) collections, as well as air and rail passenger traffic, according to the Confederation of Indian Industry.

CII‚Äôs business outlook survey indicates an increasing number of businesses are optimistic about prospects of fresh private investments.

The survey done in the May-June period, involved over 180 businesses across sectors and regions with nearly two-thirds representing micro, small and medium enterprises, CII said.

CII‚Äôs Business Confidence Index stood at 66.1 in the June quarter, compared to 64 in the previous quarter, and 66.9 in the year earlier.

Most businesses covered in the survey expected the economy to grow at 6-7% this fiscal year, in line with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)‚Äôs estimates of 6.5% economic growth.

Survey participants said the momentum of capital expenditure by central government, strong domestic drivers and a robust financial system are top three factors to aid growth.

The Centre is also counting on improved financial health of lenders and other companies to kick in a fresh cycle of private investments that could aid further economic growth and create more jobs.

That said, slowing growth in developed economies as well as deepening geopolitical risks may impact economic growth forecast for FY24.

CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee said that the positive outlook in business confidence in the June quarter is encouraging and reiterates the on-ground experience of most industry players. ‚ÄúImprovement in demand has translated into improvement in capacity utilisation in msany sectors, which will lend impetus to private capex.""

‚ÄúAn overwhelming majority of respondents (65%) are of the view that the fresh sightings in private investment will be sustained in the current fiscal,"" he said citing deleveraged corporate balance sheets, which in turn increased the capacity of private businesses ‚Äúto invest once there is a clear visibility on demand"".

In view of the global economic slowdown, 60% of the respondents said there‚Äôs no change in their international investment plans. Nearly 46% of respondents said their India investment plans will not change but 39% anticipated an increase in investments.

The survey said businesses expect the pause on interest rate increases to continue ‚Äúto preserve growth impulses"". 62% of the respondents cited muted global growth and geopolitical turbulence to be key concerns for the current financial year.

The pause on interest rate increases is expected to bring down the cost of capital for businesses, fuelling fresh investments and giving private capex a further leg-up, the industry body said.

‚ÄúThere are already signs of increase in capacity utilisation of the respondent companies, with more than half (52%) expecting it to stand in a range of 75-100% in the Apr-June quarter, up from 45% in the previous quarter,"" it said. Also, more businesses in the June quarter are confident of job creation growth than earlier.

Majority of the businesses are anticipating an increase in sales and in new orders in the June quarter. The profit outlook for the quarter has strengthened as over one-third of the respondents (38%) foresee an increase in profits, despite majority of them indicating high input costs.

Input price pressures, though still elevated, have moderated from the previous quarter, with 35% of the respondents expecting raw material costs to remain elevated during the Apr-June quarter as compared to 46.3% in the previous quarter, the survey said. (ends)

191,mint,Key triggers that may dictate stock market rally in near term,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/key-triggers-that-may-dictate-stock-market-rally-in-near-term-explains-sunil-subramaniam-11688754910174.html,08 Jul 2023,,"The Indian equity market is at a record level but valuations are still around the long-term mean, which may lead markets to touch higher levels if earnings growth plays out, says Sunil Subramaniam, MD and CEO, Sundaram Mutual. In an interview with Livemint, Subramaniam talked about the FII inflow trajectory amid signs of further rise in interest rates, broader market outperformance, India‚Äôs attractiveness for foreign investors, and the domestic mutual fund industry .

Market is at an all-time high level helped by sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors (FII). What, according to you, makes the Indian market attractive for FIIs? How is India placed among itspeers given the global uncertainties?

The attractiveness of the Indian market is a function of three factors. First, the pro-active and pro-business approach of the Government through the PLI scheme combined with prudent fiscal policies and strong support to capex and infra. Second, the long-term growth potential for our GDP (and hence EPS) from manufacturing, services, and consumption sectors is driven by our labour-related advantages in a world moving towards China+1.

And third, the stable outlook for oil and commodities in a slowing world (India imports 83% of its energy requirements) is a huge positive for the fiscal situation, inflation, and EPS (earnings per share) growth of commodity user sectors.

Midcaps and small caps have outperformed the large-caps recently. What are the reasons and will this outperformance continue going ahead?

The recent return of the FIIs has made select large caps relatively expensive and domestic flows have tended to be diverted to broader cap curves. Further, domestic GDP growth is more correlated with mid and small-cap EPS growth. The relatively lesser liquidity of these stocks means that a small inflow of liquidity leads to a large rise in prices. Further outperformance will depend on the earnings outlook and will be stock specific.

What is your outlook on Q1FY24 earnings? Which sectors will do well and which are expected to underperform? What are the sectors to look ahead that are expected to drive the market further?

We expect discretionary consumption (durables, auto, housing, high-end retail) to display good earnings alongside banks. External-oriented/linked sectors such as Information Technology (IT) and metals may still show some challenges.

With the market at a record high level, which type of mutual fund schemes should investors look at? And how should investors rebalance their mutual fund portfolios?

Markets are at record highs but valuations are still around our long-term mean. Hence, markets could touch higher levels if earnings growth plays out.

Aggressive investors should look at Multicap funds and Large & Midcap funds as medium-term wealth creation segments. While conservative investors should opt for Balanced Advantage Funds, Equity Savings Schemes, and Multi-Asset Funds as these are less risky alternatives.

With signs that interest rates have peaked in India as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has hit a pause button, do you think the fixed income rally is over?

RBI may not be able to continue ‚Äòpausing‚Äô if the monsoon is below average and food prices start to rise. Also, the international commodities outlook will have a bearing. Besides, if the US Federal Reserve hikes rates substantially, then RBI may have to follow suit to protect the currency.

Hence it is too early to say that rates have peaked and that the fixed-income rally is over.

The US Fed is likely to hike interest rates this year. This will narrow the interest rate differential between India and the US. Do you think this will lead to an outflow of foreign capital and will we witness FII selloff from Indian markets?

We expect RBI to also hike rates to maintain parity and if this happens then outflows will not need to happen.

Also Read: Which mutual funds can get cheaper post Sebi‚Äôs TER proposals?

Sebi has deferred the decision to implement the new mutual fund total expense ratio (TER) proposal. How big is the relief for your AMC and for the industry?

It is a big relief for the industry, especially for distribution and brokerages.

How, according to you, Sebi‚Äôs latest order on execution-only platforms will impact the industry and investors?

It will help and aid market expansion and create a larger base of investors for the industry to tap into through cross-sell.

The challenges faced by mutual funds to retain investor participation have increased recently. Do you think the SIPs, and other mutual fund schemes help wade out growing uncertainty?

Absolutely. Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is the best vehicle for an investor to reduce risk and enhance the reward-risk ratio through rupee cost averaging. Besides the power of compounding will lead to a large base of happy investors over the long term.

192,mint,India‚Äôs fortunes are tightly intertwined with Maruti‚Äôs,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-fortunes-are-tightly-intertwined-with-marutis-11688714218904.html,07 Jul 2023,,"In 1953, when Charles Wilson, a former CEO of General Motors was appointed secretary of defence by President Eisenhower, he said at his confirmation hearing, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs good for General Motors is good for America and vice-versa‚Ä¶ Our contribution to the nation is quite considerable."" A similar statement could be made about Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) vis-a-vis India, despite the fact that the promoter is Japanese.

Automobile manufacturing has a very long value-chain. Cars have thousands of parts, so inputs include everything from metals to electronics, plastics, glass and leather. Moreover, marketing and selling a car involves service sectors such as advertising and finance, and repair and maintenance functions are needed to keep it running. Put this all together and making and running a car creates plenty of jobs for both skilled and unskilled workers across sectors.

Popular vehicles like Marutis ‚Äì the ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs car"" ‚Äì are also bellwethers for consumption. Maruti holds a roughly 40% marketshare across all four-wheel vehicles and more than 50% in the economy segment. If sales are strong, that‚Äôs an indication the middle class is doing well.

The four-wheeler sector has started seeing growth in volumes, especially in the crucial economy segment. MSIL could be a big beneficiary. The company's stock has been in the news since the launch of the Invicto SUV pushed it past ‚Çπ10,000. Granted that‚Äôs just an arbitrary round number, but demand appears strong with a backlog of several lakh orders.

MSIL is likely to beat the market in terms of growth. Its range starts at less than ‚Çπ4 lakh for the WagonR and crosses ‚Çπ25 lakh for high-end SUVs, which means it now straddles several segments of the market. Sales in June 2023 grew to 1.33 lakh vehicles, representing 40% marketshare and 8.4% growth over June 2022, when it sold 1.22 lakh vehicles. Overall, car sales grew to 3.28 lakh, up 2.5% from 3.20 lakh in June 2022.

MSIL, which can currently build around 22.5 lakh vehicles a year, will increase this capacity by 10 lakh with ‚Çπ8,000 crore of capex in FY24. It also expects a rise in CNG-vehicle orders after the latest price-setting policy, which reduced CNG costs.

The company hopes for improved chip supplies after three years of issues but admits that persistent problems may continue to affect production for the next six months. (MSIL estimated a loss of production of 170,000 units in FY23 owing to chip shortages). But lower costs of rare-earth metals, plastics and petrochemical products should lead to better margins.

However, there is strong competition in this space and manufacturing costs could increase if a new airbag mandate is implemented. There‚Äôs another potential shadow on this front, with China placing export controls on two key metals used in semiconductors. This could lead to yet another round of chip shortages.

There are rumours that the company is looking at launching a purely electric vehicle with high-end features (550 km range, 60 kWh battery, fast charging and more) in October 2024.

MSIL hopes to increase its penetration in CNG (currently around 20%) and its SUV marketshare to 25% in FY24 from 11% in FY23 with a new SUV range. The Q4 FY23 results showed higher operating revenues of ‚Çπ32,048 crore, (up 20% YoY and up 10% QoQ). Raw-material costs were up 19% YoY and 11% QoQ. Ebitda rose 38% to ‚Çπ3,350 crore but the margin was almost flat at 9.1%. PAT was ‚Çπ2624 crore, up 43% YoY and 12% QoQ. Q1 FY24 should be better on the cost front.

The stock has seen quite a lot of FPI buying and is up 15% in the past 12 months. Most industry watchers expect MSIL to gain marketshare through FY24 and to raise realisations. As the company increases its marketshare in the SUV segment, the average selling price per unit will rise (the Invicto is priced at more than ‚Çπ24 lakh).

If there‚Äôs demand for MSIL‚Äôs vehicles, that‚Äôs a sign of rural income rebound or at least of rising confidence amongst middle-income buyers in the rural and semi-urban segments. This data is usually highly correlated with GDP growth."
193,mint,Indian startups witness 72% decline in funding during H1 2023: Report,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/indian-startups-witness-72-decline-in-funding-during-h1-2023-report-11688701198424.html,07 Jul 2023,,"Indian startups witnessed a 72% decline in funding during the first half of 2023 as compared to last year in the same period, according to a report titled ‚ÄòTracxn Geo Semi-Annual Report: India Tech- H1 2023‚Äô. This year from January to June (H1), the total startup funding was $5.5 billion in the country.

The report also stated that the Indian startup funding trend shows a global decline, despite being ranked among the world's top three funded geographies after the United States and the United Kingdom, CNBC reported.

In addition, the number of funding rounds in the Indian startup ecosystem also experienced a decrease in H1 2023. In H1 2023, there were 536 funding rounds, while the numbers were 946 in H2 2022 and over 1,500 in H1 2022.

However, India still continues to be one of the fastest-growing economies and there is tremendous growth potential in the country's startup ecosystem, said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn.

In an official statement as quoted by CNBC, the company said, ‚ÄúThe rise in this sector can be attributed to the growing Electric Vehicles (EVs) industry in the country, driven by rising EV adoption and favorable government policies promoting cleaner mobility.""

Apart from funding, India also witnessed a decline in the number of new unicorns in H1 2023, the report said, adding that the top investors of the year so far include IPV, Accel, and 100X.VC.

The funding squeeze at Indian startups has already led to layoffs and delayed stock listings. It is set to worsen and will likely lead to industry consolidation. ""This is a fundamental reset, not just another blip,"" said V T Bharadwaj, a former managing director of Sequoia Capital India who now leads venture capital firm A91 Partners.

‚ÄúI don't think I'll again see a record fund raise year like 2021 at least for a decade,"" he added as quoted by ANI.

Tech companies were valued richly and went public at prices that brought in huge profits for their investors. The crypto market was also booming. However, in the second half of 2022, and into 2023, interest rates rose, valuations fell along with the stock markets, and crypto markets collapsed.

He does not see any risks to corporate earnings right now and expects earnings growth in the high teens for the next two years. In an interview with Mint, he said there are plenty of opportunities available for investors now.

Edited excerpts:

1US Fed has signalled rate hikes are on the cards now. How will it impact the market?

With the release of the latest dot plots and the guidance of further hikes, if inflation remains high, the markets have largely priced in the Fed‚Äôs anticipated moves and are now more focused on inflation data which is showing initial signs of cooling off.

The global economy does not appear to be in good shape. The US, Europe and China are struggling. Can India remain unaffected by a global economic slowdown?

China is struggling to get back to its normal growth post covid and we have seen measures like rate cuts, liquidity infusion etc., being taken to revive the economy there. Also, Europe is showing some signs of a deteriorating economic situation and the latest data suggests it has entered a technical mild recession.

However, coming to the US, the economy there is still showing resilience and if you look at the data the overall consumer spending is still strong rising by 3.8 per cent in Q1-23 and both households and businesses have historically low amounts of debt. So, global growth may be slow, but there is a low probability of any contraction.

Coming to India, certainly, there are some risks to the growth if there is a significant global slowdown which may also affect our exports but I think this largely is balanced out by strong domestic growth led by aggressive investments towards creating infrastructure, promoting investments across multiple important sectors through its successful production-linked incentive (PLI) etc. and the impact could be few basis points which has already been seen in current year GDP forecast which have been revised down to 6.3 per cent by World Bank, which is still the fastest growing major economy in the world.

Can El Nino have a significant impact on the domestic economy?

I think initially it did have an impact and we have seen some delay in the onset of monsoon. However, now the monsoon has started in full flow and is now expected to cover the entire country over the next two-three days, nearly a week before its expected date. Also, the latest forecast by IMD for July months is positive so looks like this year could be a normal year or just about a normal year with a minimal shortfall which is positive for the domestic economy.

Where should one invest in this market for the next one-two year? What sectors are you positive about?

There are a lot of opportunities available for investors to invest in various sectors as per their risk-taking capabilities. One could look for investing in primarily focusing on domestic-oriented sectors and sectors catering to the domestic economy like manufacturing, infra, auto and auto ancillaries, defence, financial services and consumer. Also, IT should do good in the recovery of global growth providing support to the sector.

What is your view on the current valuation of the Indian market? Should we be concerned about earnings downcycle?

At present markets are evenly poised as far as valuations are concerned. They are neither too cheap nor expensive. Don‚Äôt see any concern or risks to corporate earnings right now and should see earnings growth in the high teens for the next two years.

What is your investing mantra for new investors? What key factors should they keep in mind before picking a stock for investment?

The best mantra to make money in the markets are consistency, persistence and duration. One should start investing as soon as possible, continue to invest consistently each month and remain invested for the long term.

Coming to direct investing, I think it is best to have the service of a professional investment advisor or invest through mutual funds and avoid investing on a here-say basis.

""Our view is that in the second half of the year, growth is going to slow down. And although this might seem odd, some slowdown in growth is needed to support macroeconomic and financial stability,"" Aziz told ET.

""As much of recent growth in India has been driven by exports, especially of services, with the global economy slowing in the second half of the year, including the US entering a modest recession, India‚Äôs growth will also slow. But macroeconomic stability should not be impaired given India‚Äôs large foreign exchange reserves and the government holding to its fiscal deficit target,"" said Aziz.

Aziz pointed out that aggressive monetary tightening has not damaged consumption and investment as it could have. This signals the US Fed may need to hike interest rates more.

In India, Aziz said the ""decline in inflation, because of growth slowing down in the second half of the year, will open up space for the RBI to cut rates.""

Aziz, however, added that it is unlikely to be the start of an extended easing cycle, but there may be some easing starting in the fourth quarter of the calendar year.

Talking about El Nino risk, Aziz believes India can withstand any modest impact from El Nino on food inflation, thanks to last year's food stocks and improved food management.

""Given last year‚Äôs food stocks and improved food management, I think India is in a reasonably good position to withstand any modest impact from El Nino on food inflation,"" said Aziz.

""If the shock is modest, there are enough revenue and expenditure buffers to keep to this year‚Äôs budget target and overall public sector borrowing of 10 per cent of GDP. These numbers should be achievable unless something really bad happens,"" Aziz added.

197,mint,The eight core infrastructure industries registered a 4.3% growth in May,https://www.livemint.com/market/the-production-of-coal-fertilizers-steel-and-cement-increased-in-may-2023-over-may-2022-11688127872845.html,30 Jun 2023,,"The Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), which measures the combined and individual performance of key sectors in the Indian economy, showed a growth of 4.3 percent in May 2023 compared to May 2022. The ICI comprises the production of eight core industries: Coal , Crude Oil , Natural Gas , Refinery Products , Fertilizers , Steel , Cement , and Electricity . These industries hold significant weight, accounting for 40.27 percent of the items included in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).

Several sectors recorded positive growth in May 2023 compared to the same period last year. Cement production, with a weightage of 5.37 percent, saw the highest growth rate of 15.5 percent. Steel production, accounting for 17.92 percent, increased by 9.2 percent, while coal production, with a weightage of 10.33 percent, witnessed a growth rate of 7.2 percent. Fertilizers and refinery products also showed growth rates of 9.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively.

However, some sectors experienced a decline in production. Crude oil production, with a weightage of 8.98 percent, declined by 1.9 percent, and natural gas production, accounting for 6.88 percent, saw a minor decline of 0.3 percent. Electricity generation, which holds the highest weightage of 19.85 percent, also declined by 0.3 percent.

Looking at the cumulative growth rate of the ICI for April-May 2023-24, it reported a provisional growth rate of 4.3 percent compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. This indicates an overall positive trend in the performance of the core industries.

Analyzing the yearly indices and growth rates, it can be observed that most sectors have shown consistent growth over the years. Steel production, for instance, has consistently increased since 2014-15, with a cumulative index growth of 177.6 in 2022-23 compared to the base year of 2011-12. Similarly, cement production has seen a steady rise, reaching a cumulative index growth of 170.5 in 2022-23.

However, some sectors have experienced fluctuations in growth rates. Crude oil production, for example, witnessed a decline in recent years, with a negative growth rate of 2.7 percent in 2022-23 compared to the previous year. Natural gas production also declined, albeit at a slower rate of 1.5 percent.

These fluctuations in growth rates can be attributed to various factors, including changes in demand, supply constraints, and global market dynamics. It is important for policymakers and industry stakeholders to monitor these trends and address any challenges to ensure sustained growth and stability in the core industries.

The data provided in the Index of Eight Core Industries serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, economists, and investors to assess the performance of key sectors in the Indian economy. It provides insights into the overall industrial production and helps in formulating strategies for economic growth and development.

In conclusion, the May 2023 data for the Index of Eight Core Industries indicates positive growth in several sectors, including cement, steel, coal, fertilizers, and refinery products. While some sectors experienced a decline, the overall performance of the core industries remained stable. Continued monitoring and support from policymakers will be crucial to maintain the growth momentum and address any challenges faced by these industries.

He also praised the central government's ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô campaign, saying that it has a ‚Äòtruly impressive effect‚Äô on the country's economy, according to a report published by the news agency PTI, citing RT News.

The 'Make in India' initiative was launched by PM Modi in 2014 and aimed to create and encourage companies to develop, manufacture and assemble products made in the country and incentivize dedicated investments into manufacturing.

‚ÄúOur friends in India and our big friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, launched the ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô initiative several years ago. It has had a truly impressive effect on the Indian economy,"" Putin said.

""It would do no harm to emulate what is working well, even if it was not us but our friends who created it,"" the Russian President added.

His remarks came while discussing the opportunities for Russian companies due to the West's sanctions policies, and the need for Moscow to offer support tools to help the companies market their product more efficiently.

Putin credited Indian leadership for creating an effective model to develop local manufacturing capabilities and wooing foreign investors.

He further emphasized the need to think about ‚Äúmaking our products more convenient and functional, with a modern look and properties"", the RT News report said.

India has the largest population of over 1.4 billion people and the 5th largest GDP of around USD 3.7 trillion.

In recent years, India has emerged not only as an alternative destination for license manufacturing for global companies but also as a massive consumer market for foreign investors, the report said.

The country's export performance has improved, according to official data, from around USD 468 billion in 2014 to an estimated USD 770 billion in the 2022-23 fiscal year, PTI reported.

India has also seen a significant increase in foreign direct investment inflows, from USD 36 billion in 2014 to over USD 81 billion in 2020-21.

Putin and Modi last met on the sidelines of a regional security bloc summit in Uzbekistan in September 2022.

201,mint,Global economy faces heightened uncertainty amidst banking system fragility: RBI,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/rbi-fsr-global-economy-faces-heightened-uncertainty-amid-banking-system-fragility-what-about-india-11687961836257.html,28 Jun 2023,,"The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) on Wednesday said the global economy is facing heightened uncertainty amidst banking system fragility in certain countries. RBI said in the financial stability report for June 2023. Also, geopolitical tensions persist, whereas, moderated but elevated inflations remain.

RBI's FSR report reflects the collective assessment of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) on risks to financial stability and the resilience of the Indian financial system.

In regards to the global economy, RBI said ""It is facing heightened uncertainty amidst banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation.""

According to RBI, the resilience of the global financial system has been tested by the recent banking turmoil and interaction between monetary policy tightening and financial sector stress. Uncertainty about the global macro-financial outlook has risen.

RBI believes that EMEs could face significant challenges if global growth decelerates faster than anticipated, financial strains re-emerge, and risk aversion increases.

It also added that the policy trade-offs are becoming more challenging although recent forceful actions by central banks provide comfort that financial stability would be preserved without conceding the fight against inflation.

Against this backdrop, RBI said, ""The Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient in an environment of macroeconomic and financial stability.""

India's purchasing managers‚Äô indices (PMIs) continue to outperform regional and global indices for both manufacturing and services.

Further, India's gross domestic products (GDP) growth is expected to be at 6.5% in FY24, with risks evenly balanced at this juncture.

In regards to the health of the Indian banking system, RBI believes it is robust, fortified by non-performing loans at a multi-year low and adequate level of capital and liquidity buffers.

Indian scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) gross non-performing assets (GNPA) continued to be on a downward slope and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023. While net NPA also dipped to 1%.

Data from RBI showed that macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively.

In an exclusive interview with news agency PTI, Governor Das said, ‚ÄúOne thing I can clearly tell you is that the ‚Çπ2,000 currency note that we are withdrawing right now will not have any negative impact on the economy.""

Earlier, Das had said that since the decision to withdraw ‚Çπ2,000 notes was announced, more than two-thirds of the total currency notes in circulation have returned to the system.

""More than two-thirds or ‚Çπ2.41 lakh crore worth of the ‚Çπ3.62 lakh crore (as of March 31, 2023) of the now-recalled 2000 banknotes have come back to the system as of mid-last week,"" Governor Das told PTI last week.

As part of the clean note policy, the central bank on May 19 announced that ‚Çπ2,000 currency notes worth around ‚Çπ3.62 lakh crore will be withdrawn from the circulation.

Within days of announcing demonetisation in November 2016, ‚Çπ2,000 currency notes were introduced into the system. About 89 percent of the 2,000 banknotes were issued prior to March 2017 and are at the end of their estimated life span of four-five years. The total value of these banknotes in circulation has declined from ‚Çπ6.73 lakh crore at its peak as of March 31, 2018 (37.3 per cent of notes in circulation) to ‚Çπ3.62 lakh crore, constituting only 10.8 per cent of the notes in circulation as of March 31, 2023

The central bank's mints had stopped printing the 2,000 notes way back in 2018-19 itself.

203,mint,Time to breathe new life into the India story,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-power-of-indian-diplomacy-modi-s-influence-on-global-politics-and-the-rise-of-the-indian-diaspora-11687707687156.html,25 Jun 2023,,"What makes 21 June 2015 different from 21 June 2023? When Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed yoga with thousands as part of Yoga Day eight years ago, others dismissed it as a ‚Äúshow"" by a political ‚Äúshowman"". The significance of such showmanship in politics, diplomacy, and public life was evident in New York this time around.

Modi practised yoga with delegates from 183 countries on the North Lawn of the UN Headquarters on that day. Until recently, his predecessors used to utilize their overseas trips to promote politics in their own country. Through Indian immigrants and Indian traditions, Modi has now begun to influence the internal politics of other democracies throughout the world. As yet, prior to him, no Indian Prime Minister has recognized this power.

Its first impressions began to emerge shortly after ‚ÄòHowdy Modi‚Äô was held on 22 September 2019, in Texas. Addressing an Indian crowd in the presence of then US president Donald Trump, the Prime Minister demonstrated to the entire world for the first time that these are the days of Indian pride. Modi was aware that the number of non-resident Indians in the US is close to 4.5 million. They play a vital role in the local political, social, and economic landscape. This is why, like Trump, Biden has indicated his aim to deepen ties with these voters via Modi. In a democracy, nothing is more vital than the voter and his/her vote. Consequently, India and the Indian diaspora are becoming increasingly significant to Western countries, including the US. Indian immigrants in Africa were already powerful enough.

The US is the most powerful country in the world, and we have the largest democracy. It is easy to argue that, in the shifting geopolitical landscape of the globe, the US needs India and India needs the US. Can you expect such relations between the US and Afghanistan, or between the US and Russia? Successful partnerships cannot be formed solely on necessities.

Take Pakistan for example. We fought four wars against that country. It continues to wage a shadow war against us, costing billions of dollars and valuable human lives each year. Despite this, why have our social ties with Pakistan remained? Language, culture, eating habits, and human-to-human relationships never change. Similarly, the way the Indian diaspora has reinforced its standing in nations such as the US, Australia, and UK has made dialogue between the government in New Delhi and their rulers easier.

I was in Singapore and Malaysia last week. On this five-day trip, I had to deal with four interpreters. Those with me in Singapore were of Chinese ancestry. They kept emphasizing that we have more than 9% Tamils here, who make significant contributions to the country. They brought up Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs name often during the conversation. This has never happened before. The same was true about Malaysia. In reality, the Indian diaspora has a strong sense of optimism about India today. If you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the news from last Thursday. There were two more news pieces, both of which were prominently published with Modi‚Äôs yoga event. The Indian stock market had reached a new high, and the gold price had dropped by ‚Çπ360. The data from the last three years show that, despite covid and the Russia-Ukraine war, the Indian economy outperformed expectations. Despite rising prices and unemployment, the Indian market and buyers remain optimistic. Covid-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war have put Europe into a recession, but Indian markets have returned to glory.

It‚Äôs no surprise that many economists believe India will dominate for the next 15 years.

Indeed, India and the people of Indian origin have come a long way. I recall the time when Mahendra Pal Chaudhary, a person of Indian origin, was elected prime minister of Fiji in 1999. His government survived just a year in power with great difficulty. On 27 May 2000 the majority of his cabinet and he himself were captured by opposition leader George Speight and rebel forces.

At present, Rishi Sunak is the prime minister of Britain, making Indians all around the world feel proud. The country that left us financially poor 75 years ago is now in the hands of an Indian. Today, CEOs of Indian origin lead 25 of the world‚Äôs top 500 corporations. People of Indian origin have a voice in parliaments, ministries, and in big institutions on every continent. There is no better time than now to breathe new life into the ‚ÄúIndia story"" that Manmohan Singh once crafted.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing an exemplary job in this regard.

204,mint,"As monsoon knocks on the doors, can it revive demand for consumer durables?",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/as-monsoon-knocks-the-doors-can-it-revive-demand-for-consumer-durables-11687660256370.html,25 Jun 2023,,"The Indian Meteorological Department has forecast a the fourth straight year of normal monsoon rainfall. The IMD classifies normal rainfall as between 96% and 104% of the Long Period Average (LPA). This forecast brings some relief to the economy, which is currently grappling with high food inflation and slowing global growth. Usually, a shortfall in monsoon rainfall can be attributed to the expected development of El Nino conditions during the monsoon season. It is widely known that the chances of low rainfall increase in an El Nino year, and the delayed monsoon arrival has already caused some deficit in rainfall.

However, it is important to note that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the emergence of El Nino and deficient monsoon rainfall in India. Previous experiences have shown that the emergence of El Nino does not necessarily mean a significant drop in rainfall or the occurrence of a drought. Moreover, the resilience of Indian agriculture towards adverse weather shocks, particularly deficient rainfall, has undeniably increased over the years. This resilience is primarily due to the increased intensity of irrigation, with the gross irrigated area as a percentage of the gross cropped area expanding.

Nevertheless, the ability of the agricultural sector to absorb the shock of deficient rainfall varies across states and is closely linked to the overall area under irrigation. The sector's response and recovery from such challenges also depends on factors such as cooling of inflation, government spending on the agriculture sector, and the implementation of deeper direct distribution methods. These factors, which are considered more structural in nature, have been highlighted by some major consumer goods companies and will continue to fuel rural recovery.

The demand for consumer durables in the first quarter of the year has not been great due to unseasonal rainfall. However, there is an expectation of some recovery in consecutive quarters and a better second half of the year 2023-24. This anticipation is based on the prospect of a longer summer, which is likely to support increased consumer demand. Looking at the key long to medium term growth drivers for the consumer durables sector, various factors remain intact. These include lower penetration levels, increasing urbanization and electrification, rising disposable income and aspirations of the population, changing lifestyles and preferences, technological advancements and innovation, as well as government schemes and incentives.

However, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its June 2023 bulletin has revealed that India's domestic crude oil basket, equity prices of oil and gas sector firms and sovereign bond yields witness high volatility during the oil output decisions by OPEC+.

The economic impact of global oil supply have important implications for India ‚Äì a net importer of crude oil ‚Äì to deliver price stability. Moreover, the oil supply-related news shocks cause a sustained increase in consumer prices and reduce the domestic output - for a short duration. Oil prices and financial markets typically tend to be more volatile around OPEC meetings and exhibit significantly abnormal returns after the oil producing cartel announce reduction in its global production quota, according to RBI's bulletin.

How have OPEC+ decisions affected oil prices?

OPEC meeting outcomes as well as economic and geopolitical events impacts analysts' expectations in the crude oil market. On March 6, 2020, OPEC countries failed to strike a deal with their allies led by Russia on oil production cuts. At that time, markets expected an imminent price war within oil exporting countries. Consequently, oil futures went down across all tenors on the next trading day, i.e., March 9, 2020.

Similarly, when the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, market participants expected lower demand for crude only in the near future but negligible impact over the medium term. Reflecting this sentiment, on the very next day, futures price went down sharply for short-term contracts but only marginally in the case of longer term contracts.

In the OPEC meeting held on July 18, 2021, the OPEC and non- OPEC allies reached an agreement to boost oil supply by September 2022 as prices had climbed to the highest levels in more than two years. This led to an immediate decline in crude futures across all tenors

Finally, in February 2022, the implications of the Russia-Ukraine war were visible on crude oil prices as Brent crude oil hit a price of $125 per barrel in March 2022 - the highest since 2012 and almost six-folds above the bottom observed during April 2020. This gave way to an energy-induced cost- push inflation across the globe and oil prices have been volatile since then.

In April 2023, OPEC announced oil production cuts of around 1.16 million barrels per day (bpd) in a surprise decision, which led to oil prices immediately surging over 8 per cent to $83.95 a barrel. In March, benchmark Brent crude fell to $72 per barrel - the lowest in 15 months, due to the collapse of major global banks including Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Credit Suisse.

Earlier this month, OPEC+ decided to reduce the overall production targets from 2024 by a further total of 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in its latest meeting. Although, Saudi Arabia, OPEC cartel's dominant member, will make deep production cuts of 1 million bpd starting from July, as part of a broader output-limiting OPEC+ deal as the group faces flagging oil prices and a looming supply glut. The rest of the OPEC producers agreed to extend earlier cuts in supply through the end of 2024.

OPEC‚Äôs share in world oil production has been declining in recent years. In fact, OPEC‚Äôs share in global oil production has dropped from 42.3 per cent in 2012 to 36.2 per cent in 2020 as per data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). OPEC‚Äôs share in total global oil production is estimated to gradually rise from 36.8 per cent in 2021 to 42.2 per cent by 2050.

How have OPEC+ decisions impacted global economy?

The global oil supply, global demand for oil and expectations about future oil market conditions are fundamental drivers of oil price movements. In the context of global oil supply, conventional supply shocks are interpreted as sudden disruptions in the current supply of crude oil that gets reflected in an instantaneous fall in oil supply, an increase in oil price and a reduction in inventories.

From a medium-term policy perspective, oil price shocks are particularly important as they tend to have a stagflationary impact on the economy, said RBI's bulletin. Oil supply shocks shift the production and prices of oil in different paths, whereas an oil demand shock shifts the oil production and oil prices in the same direction, according to RBI. The oil supply and demand shocks account for 50 and 35 per cent of total oil price changes, respectively.

‚Äò‚ÄôIf a surprise OPEC announcement leads oil market participants to expect a production shortfall in the future, they will build up inventories today to cover up for lesser oil production tomorrow. Thus, the reaction of oil inventories is the differentiating feature between oil supply news shocks and traditional oil supply shocks,'' said RBI in its bulletin.

Moreover, a drop in oil prices driven by positive supply shocks boosts economic activity in advanced economies, while dampening activity in emerging markets. Oil price shocks have discrete macroeconomic consequences and the overall macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks in the US are more similar to the Euro area than to that of China.

For oil importing countries, such as India, the increases in global oil prices directly impact domestic prices by increasing the price of imported goods and indirectly through increasing transportation costs. It also burdens the current account deficit (CAD) and pressurises the exchange rate. On the other hand, for exporting countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and others, oil price increases add to their export revenue thereby lifting their economic output.

Global inflation rose from 4.7 per cent in 2021 to 8.7 per cent in 2022. Although it is expected to decline to 7.0 per cent in 2023, it will still remain above the level seen in 2021. Since then, central banks across the globe have promptly reacted to the inflationary surge by hiking their policy rates and scaling back their accommodative policies to combat inflation.

How have OPEC+ decisions impacted Indian economy?

India‚Äôs crude oil consumption has increased seven times accounting for about 5 per cent of world‚Äôs total crude oil consumption. India is the fourth-largest global energy consumer behind China, the United States and the European Union. India is slated to overtake the European Union as the world‚Äôs third-largest energy consumer by 2030 according to the India Energy Outlook 2021, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

India‚Äôs oil demand is expected to rise by 74 per cent to 8.7 Mb/d by 2040 under the existing scenario. The natural gas requirement is projected to more than triple to 201 billion cubic meters (IEA, 2021). The country's energy outlook suggests that the price of crude oil and other energy sources will have significant bearing on major financial and macroeconomic variables.

Economic indicators such as consumer prices in India and domestic output, along with key financial indicators such as INR, bond yields, and stock prices have shown movements to OPEC+ oil supply decisions.

While domestic currency appreciates against the US dollar on the impact of oil supply shock, surprise changes in expectations about future oil supply are expected to lead to an increase in oil inventories raising the domestic demand for US dollars to purchase available crude oil in the market. This leads to a depreciation of the domestic currency (INR) over time as seen in the medium-term response of exchange rate to oil supply news shocks.

At the same time, there is a persistent increase in domestic consumer prices in response to an oil supply news shock. The sustained increase in prices is expected to lead to a lower aggregate demand as households and firms are left with less disposable incomes to spend on non-energy goods.

Moreover, surprise changes in oil prices can also influence the price and wage-setting in the economy by altering the inflation expectations of firms and households, and so, domestic economic activity falls on impact of such a shock. However, the impact is felt only for a short duration as it reverts to mean quickly.

Lastly, while the immediate reaction of monetary policy is seen to be accommodative on impact perhaps to cushion the short-term fall in economic activity, monetary policy is gradually tightened to counter the increase in prices. So, the impulse response analysis underlines the cost-push effect of oil supply surprises ‚Äì causing an increase in consumer prices and a fall in economic output ‚Äì on the Indian economy.

RBI concludes that not only do financial markets react to supply-related announcements by the OPEC, domestic output falls and consumer prices increase as a result of oil supply news shocks.

‚ÄúRecent national accounts data and corporate results when read in conjunction clearly show that inflation is slowing down personal consumption. This, in turn, is moderating corporate sales and holding back private investment in capacity creation,"" said the bulletin.

Private consumption grew at 2.8% in the January-March quarter of FY23, while it grew 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted sequential basis after contracting 2% in the previous three months.

However, gross fixed capital formation, which reflects government and private investment, rose 8.9% in the January-March quarter and 11.4% for the full financial year.

‚ÄúIt is axiomatic that the path to high but sustainable inclusive growth has to be paved by price stability. Once this is realised, the trade-offs and dilemmas confronting the conduct of monetary policy fade away,"" said the bulletin

The RBI‚Äôs monetary policy committee (MPC) retained repo rate at 6.5% for the second consecutive month and maintained the policy stance as withdrawal from accommodation.

According to the bulletin, the MPC's 'flexible inflation targeting framework' helps growth preservation and promotion.

""It is by no means the single-minded pursuit of a single target as the critics would have us believe. It is axiomatic that the path to high but sustainable inclusive growth has to be paved by price stability,"" it said.

However, the poll also highlighted that consumption and exports will act as significant obstacles to growth.

Consumer spending, which accounts for 60% of India's economy, has noticeably slowed down in recent times, failing to provide the support it once did. This has shifted the responsibility to the government to sustain strong economic growth through extensive capital expenditure (capex) plans, as private investment has remained sluggish.

Also read: Explained: What drove India's GDP growth in FY23?

Nearly 60% of economists, 19 out of 33 surveyed expressed the view that government spending would be the primary driver of economic growth in the fiscal year ending in March, while 12 economists believed that investment would play a pivotal role. However many of those who said investment emphasised that a substantial portion of growth would be attributed to the government's capex initiatives, as private investment has not yet exhibited significant momentum.

Principal economist at HDFC Bank, Sakshi Gupta said, ‚Äúwe clearly know exports are not going to be the primary driver, and when we look at consumption, we are beginning to get a sense it is going to slow down. So, then we're left with the heavy lifting by the government ‚Äì doing capex."" She added that the private sector's involvement in the investment push may remain limited, indicating a continued trend of modest private capex.

The median forecast from the survey projected a 6.1% growth rate for the Indian economy this fiscal year, although the challenging global economic outlook suggests potential downgrades in the coming months. Forecasts ranged from 3.7% to 6.9%. Next fiscal year, the economy is expected to grow by 6.2%.

Respondents predicted growth rates of 7.3%, 6.2%, and 6.0% for the current and subsequent quarters, followed by a slowdown to 5.5% in the March quarter of 2024.

The private consumption cycle, which was already lagging before the COVID-19 pandemic, saw a meager growth rate of 2.8% in the fourth quarter.

When asked about the biggest factors hindering economic growth this fiscal year, 14 economists cited exports, while 13 pointed to consumption. Three economists mentioned investment, one mentioned government spending, and two stated that none of these factors would be significant drags.

""Services exports (are) doing well, but in manufacturing, there is a slowdown. Petroleum, textiles, and two-wheeler exports have come down, and it's very unlikely they will reverse that in a big way,"" said Suman Chowdhury, chief economist at Acuit√© Ratings. Despite some positive developments in electronic exports driven by local manufacturing by companies like Apple and Samsung, the overall export scenario is anticipated to remain subdued until global conditions improve.

According to some participants, the downtrend was likely to extend to consumer spending as well.

""Weak consumption is a concern...the rural economy wasn't doing very well. It's still recovering, and all of it totally adds up to a view consumption will remain an underperformer this year,""said Dhiraj Nim ANZ economist.

- PM Modi also made a strong push for reforming multilateral institutions, including the UN, and spoke glowingly of India's ties with the US, saying the two countries stand at a new dawn in their relationship that will not only shape their destiny but also that of the world. ""We share a vision of a free, open and inclusive Indo Pacific, connected by secure seas, defined by international law, free from domination‚Ä¶""A region where all nations, small and large, are free and fearless in their choices, where progress is not suffocated by an impossible burden of debt, where connectivity is not leveraged for strategic purposes, where all nations are lifted by the high tide of shared prosperity,"" he said.

- The Prime Minister during his address also spoke about unity in diversity in India. He also defended his government's record on democracy and human rights, asserting democracy is ""in our spirit...and flows in our veins"" and that there was no discrimination against minorities. ""We have twenty two official languages and thousands of dialects, and yet, we speak in one voice. We are home to all faiths in the world, and we celebrate all of them. In India, diversity is a natural way of life,"" he said in a clear rebuttal to the charges of India's democratic backsliding under him.

- PM Modi also spoke about women empowerment, he said, ‚ÄúToday, in modern India women are leading us to a better future. India's vision is not just of development which benefits women, it's of women-led development where women lead the journey of progress.""

- PM Modi also spoke about the Indian Economy and said that the country will soon become the third largest economy. He said when he first visited the US as prime minister in 2014 India was the 10th largest economy in the world. ""Today, India is the fifth largest economy. And, India will be the third largest economy soon. We are not only growing bigger but we are also growing faster. When India grows, the whole world grows. After all, we are one sixth of the world's population,"" he said.

- Today, the United States has become one of our most important defence partners. Today, India and the US are working together in space and in the seas, in science and in semiconductors, in startups and sustainability, in tech and in trade, in farming and finance, in art and Artificial Intelligence..., He said.

- The Prime Minister added, ‚Äú...We became the only G20 country to meet its Paris commitment. We made renewables account for over 40% of our energy sources 9 years ahead of the target of 2030. But we did not stop there. At the Glasgow Summit, I proposed mission LiFE...Our mission is pro-planet progress, pro-planet prosperity, pro-planet people.""

- During the joint sitting, PM Modi said, ‚ÄúOur vision is 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayaas'. We are focussing on infrastructure developments. We have given nearly 40 million homes to provide shelter to over 150 million people, which is nearly 6 times the population of Australia.""

- PM Modi received standing ovation and applause when he said, ""There are millions here, who have roots in India. Some of them sit proudly in this chamber. There is one behind me, who has made history. I am told that the Samosa Caucus is now the flavour of the House."" PM Modi concluded his address to the joint sitting of the US Congress with a standing ovation and loud cheers from the Congressmen. 15 standing ovations, 79 applauses marked PM Modi‚Äôs address to the joint session of the US Congress. US Congressmen also lined up to take autographs and selfies with the Prime Minister after his address to the joint sitting of the US Congress.

210,mint,Fitch ups India‚Äôs growth forecast to 6.3%,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/fitch-raises-india-s-fy24-growth-forecast-to-6-3-on-strong-q1-momentum-highlights-risks-in-h2-and-slowing-global-trade-11687453942379.html,22 Jun 2023,,"New Delhi: Fitch Ratings on Thursday raised its FY24 growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.3%, citing strong growth in the April-June quarter so far and sustained near-term momentum.

The credit rating agency in March predicted a 6% growth rate for the ongoing financial year.

‚ÄúRecent high-frequency data point to sustained near-term momentum as highlighted by rising PMI indices, higher car sales and increased power consumption,"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement.

‚ÄúThe economy also continues to benefit from high bank credit growth and infrastructure spending (with more to come from the latter),"" it added.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has projected FY24 Indian economic growth at 6.5%.

In terms of quarterly break-ups, The Indian Central Bank expects 8% growth in the June quarter, followed by 6.5%, 6% and 5.7% in the subsequent quarters, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said at the end of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting earlier this month.

A breakdown by industry showed a recovery in manufacturing, after two consecutive quarterly contractions, a boost from construction and an increase in farm output, Fitch said.

‚ÄúIn expenditure terms, GDP growth was driven by domestic demand and a boost from net trade.""

Despite raising the GDP outlook, Fitch cautioned about potential risks to growth during the second half of the ongoing fiscal year.

‚ÄúNevertheless, while inflation has eased there are near-term upward risks in 2H23 (October 2023-March2024), given the monsoon outlook and the potential impact of El Ni√±o,"" it said.

The rating agency also cautioned that the full impact of the monetary tightening is still to be felt, while consumers have been experiencing a drop in purchasing power due to rising inflation and weakening of household balance sheets.

Slowing global trade is also expected to impact India‚Äôs economic growth in the coming quarters, the rating agency said.

During May 2023, India‚Äôs merchandise exports declined for the fourth consecutive month, by over 10%, amid a demand slowdown in the West.

‚ÄúTrade prospects are not looking good, especially because the global economy is slowing down, which will put a lot of pressure on the Indian economy,"" said Biswajit Dhar, professor, Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

‚ÄúThe larger economies are not doing well. We could see a revival only by the middle of 2024. As far as services are concerned, workers are worried about the rapid entry of AI,"" Dhar added.

In May the World Trade Organization (WTO) revised its global trade growth outlook for 2023 upwards to 1.7% from last October‚Äôs estimate of 1%.

This projected growth rate is much lower than the average rate for the last 12 years since the global financial crisis.

A recent World Bank report pegs India‚Äôs growth during early 2023 to remain below that achieved in the decade before the pandemic as higher prices and rising borrowing costs weigh in on private consumption.

‚ÄúAt the same time, the government‚Äôs push on increased capital expenditure, moderation in commodity prices and robust credit growth are expected to support investment,"" the Fitch report added.

However, risks are currently evenly balanced as high frequency data is holding up amidst the uncertainties, said Upasna Bhardwaj, chief economist, Kotak Mahindra Bank.

‚ÄúHigh borrowing costs and inflation are going to have a bearing on the purchasing power of the consumer. Most importantly, rural demand could come under pressure depending on how El Nino pans out,"" Bhardwaj added.

Simpson said visa backlogs pose a significant obstacle, with excessive waiting times ranging from 200 days to a year for certain destinations. ‚ÄúPaper visas should be a thing of the past. India is moving quickly in the e-visas space but it can move faster towards smart QR coded visas like Dubai. Also, destination marketing campaigns (like Incredible India) are absolutely critical to any country which looks to get more visitors. It is a proven fact that countries are competing with each other and those that have good destination marketing campaigns, do better than others,"" Simpson told Mint over a video call from Goa.

India‚Äôs budget for overseas promotion activities like Incredible India has been slashed by more than half to ‚Çπ167 crore this year from ‚Çπ525 crore two years ago. Meanwhile, the country has set a target of bringing in 25 million tourists by 2030.

Simpson said that the travel and tourism industry at present is expected to contribute ‚Çπ16.5 trillion to the Indian economy this year, about 3.5% below its 2019 figures. The sector will create over 1.6 million more jobs this year, recovering almost all the jobs lost due to the pandemic to reach 39 million. This means, about one in 13 workers in India will be in travel and tourism sector. International visitors are expected to spend ‚Çπ2 trillion here, with domestic visitor spend forecast to reach more than ‚Çπ12.6 trillion.

Last year, the sector‚Äôs contribution to GDP grew almost 90% to reach more than $15.6 trillion, representing 5.9% of the economy, edging closer to the 2019 high of 7%. It created 14.6 million more jobs in 2022 and reached 37.2 million jobs nationally. The research was carried out along with Oxford Economics with information sourced from UNWTO, Oxford Economics and other sources.

The council measures the value of travel and tourism in terms of its economic contribution and represents about 200 companies which account for two-thirds of a trillion US dollars in turnover, equivalent to 30% of the entire sector.

WTTC has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the World Tourism Organization of the United Nations (UNWTO) at the G20 ministerial meeting. The idea is to focus on advancing public-private sector cooperation at the global level, promoting job creation, talent development and business opportunities around the world.

The travel and tourism business was worth $10 trillion globally in 2019. At the end of this year, it will be about $9.3 trillion after pandemic battered the industry, and the world reopening in stages and China, accounting for 15% of all travel and tourism spending, opening the last.

‚ÄúGrowth will be double GDP, but we also need governments to focus on reliable energy and sustainable aviation fuel production. Tourism minister G Kishan Reddy has shown great leadership, rallying the G20 ministers under the Goa Roadmap, showing the world that Travel & Tourism boosts economies whilst meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"" Simpson said.

In India, the sector will grow its GDP contribution to ‚Çπ36.8 trillion by 2033 and approximately 7% of the Indian economy and will employ over 58.2 million people across the country, with one in 10 working in the sector.

The growth forecast changed because of a stronger outturn in the first quarter and near-term momentum. In FY23, the growth forecast compares with a 7.2% GDP expansion. The economy had a growth of 9.1% in FY22.

In an official statement, the rating agency said, ‚ÄúIndia's economy has been showing broad-based strength - with GDP up by 6.1% year-on-year in 1Q23 (January-March) and auto sales, PMI surveys and credit growth remaining robust in recent months - and we have raised our forecast for the fiscal year ending in March 2024 (FY23-24) by 0.3 percentage points to 6.3%.""

Fitch in March lowered its forecast for 2023-24 to 6% from 6.2% citing headwinds from elevated inflation and interest rates along with subdued global demand.

For the 2024-25 and 2025-26 fiscal years, it estimated a growth of 6.5% each, as per PTI reports.

The rating agency stated that GDP growth in January-March was higher than expected, saying there has been a recovery in manufacturing after two consecutive quarterly contractions, a boost from construction, and an increase in farm output.

""The stronger outturn in 1Q23 and near-term momentum have prompted us to upgrade our FY23-24 growth forecast to 6.3%...one of highest growth rates in the world,"" it said adding India's economy will be affected to an extent by slowing global trade.

Fitch Rating stated that the full impact of a 250 basis points increase in interest rates by RBI (since May 2022) is still to be felt, PTI reported.

‚ÄúConsumers have also experienced a drop in purchasing power as inflation increased sharply in 2022 and household balance sheets have also been weakened through the pandemic,"" it said.

""At the same time, the government‚Äôs push on increased capital expenditure, moderation in commodity prices, and robust credit growth are expected to support investment. Slowing inflation should also start to help consumers over time and households have now turned more optimistic about future earnings and employment,"" the agency added.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept policy rates at 6.5% since the start of the year, while headline inflation eased from a peak of 7.8% to 4.3% in May, a figure that is already within the RBI's tolerance band of 2-6%.

This comes as a relief for farmers who rely on these rains to irrigate their fields. June accounts for 16-17% of monsoon rainfall, and is crucial for sowing of kharif crops.

The onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala was delayed by a week, and the current has been advancing behind schedule in the west coast, southern peninsula, and eastern and central India. The delay was largely due to the impact of the cyclonic storm Biparjoy, which weakened into a depression and then a low-pressure area over central Uttar Pradesh.

Under the weather system, northern parts of Madhya Pradesh are expected to receive heavy rainfall till Sunday.

As the monsoon current gains strength, IMD has forecast heavy to extremely heavy rainfall over the Indian subcontinent. Extremely heavy rains are likely over Bihar, Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal today and on Thursday, and in Odisha till Sunday.

Light to moderate showers along with thunderstorm and lightning are expected over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and plains of northwest India over the next five days, while heavy rainfall has been forecast over north Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh on Sunday, and over Chhattisgarh and Vidarbha from Friday to Sunday.

Similar weather conditions are expected in coastal Andhra Pradesh till Thursday and over coastal Karnataka on Saturday. Westwen India is likely to receive light to moderate rain accompanied by thunderstorm and lightning from Thursday to Sunday.

Meanwhile, the weather department has issued heat wave warnings for Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh for today.

The data was revealed in the Right to Information Act (RTI) which was filed by Activist Manoranjan Roy.

The three mints had issued 8,810.65 million pieces of the newly designed ‚Çπ500 notes, however, RBI has only received 7,260 million, data obtained under the Right to Information Act (RTI) which Roy had filed stated.

The data of the missing 1,760.65 million 500 notes worth ‚Çπ88,032.5 crore is nowhere to be found, Roy states as per media reports. It is important to know that, India has three units where currency notes are printed- Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran (P) Limited in Bengaluru, Currency Note Press in Nashik, and Bank Note Press, Dewas in Madhya Pradesh.

The Nasik mint in the RTI mentioned that it had supplied 1,662.000 million pieces to the RBI in 2016-2017, while the Bengaluru mint supplied 5,195.65 million pieces and the Dewas mint supplied 1,953.000 million pieces to the RBI during this time. The total of the supplied notes from the three mints comes to 8,810.65 million pieces, however, the RBI has received only 7260 million pieces of the ‚Çπ500 notes.

As per the data received from RTI, between April 2015-December 2016, Currency Note Press in Nashik had printed 375.450 million pieces of the newly designed ‚Çπ500 notes, however, RBI has a record of only 345.000 million pieces. Of the 1760.65 million missing notes, 210 million pieces were printed in the Nashik mint during April 2015-March 2016, however, as per the RTI, these notes were supplied to the RBI when Raghuram Rajan was the governor.

Roy also reported wrote to the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB) and the ED in order to investigate this discrepancy. Some Senior RBI officials has also defended this mismatch pointing to the massive logistics which is involved in the printing and supply of the currency notes, media reports have stated.

Recently, the RBI released the annual report and said that the number of fake notes of ‚Çπ500 denomination detected has increased by 14.4 percent to 91,110 pieces in 2022-23 compared to the previous year. The number of fake currency notes of ‚Çπ2,000 denomination detected decreased to ‚Çπ9,806 pieces during the same period, the report stated.

216,mint,Our women wrestlers‚Äô protest marks a crucial moment,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-emergence-of-women-s-power-in-india-from-wrestling-akharas-to-the-knowledge-economy-11686765423773.html,14 Jun 2023,,"On 2 March 1955, Claudette Colvin, a 15-year-old African- American school student, boarded a segregated public bus in Montgomery and took a window seat near the exit door. The driver asked her to vacate the seat for a Caucasian passenger standing nearby. She refused. Police officers dragged her out of the bus and placed her in jail. Nine months after this incident, Rosa Parks too refused to vacate her bus seat. The Montgomery bus boycott ensued and the rest is history. Many a small event has sparked big movements.

The #MeToo movement brought into focus the issue of sexual harassment and abuse of women in the workplace. The movement did create reverberations in many workplaces in India. For the past few months, women wrestlers have been protesting against sexual harassment. Will this lead to any significant changes in India?

Even as women demanded their rightful place in society and workplaces, there were always places that were considered bastions of male dominance. Wrestling akharas have been among those places where the male‚Äôs physical strength, his big differentiator over women, was always on display. The fact that recent voices of protest against sexual harassment have come from the sidelines of these very akharas is significant. This is much like bearding the lion in his den.

This rising power of women has been a trend for some time. This decade began with the arrival of a significant data point. As per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2020, 50.04% of American jobs, excluding farm workers and the self-employed, were held by women. This significant inflexion point might be more profound than another departure that was noted in 1956. For the first time in the history of the US economy, white-collar workers, those involved in technical, managerial and clerical work, outnumbered blue-collar workers that year. Harvard sociologist Daniel Bell called this the beginning of the end of the industrial economy and the emergence of a new post-industrial society. Women‚Äôs dominance in the labour market could have much wider impact than the emergence of post-industrial knowledge economy. Indeed, the former is facilitated by the latter.

With Indian women constituting less than 25% of the organized labour force, one might wonder whether Indian women will ever come to attain equality with men at the workplace. In 1950, women constituted only 29.6% of the US workforce. The 1950s was the peak of the industrial era, a period when physical strength was in high demand. So men always had an advantage over women in the workplace. But with the emergence of the knowledge economy, women are on an equal footing with men. The ability to use one‚Äôs brain is all that matters in today‚Äôs knowledge economy.

In the US, women continued to make big strides in the knowledge economy also because they are better equipped than men with the most important requirement for the knowledge economy: education. For every two men who graduate from college in the US, three women are completing their graduation.

How are Indian girls performing on the educational front? There are some very interesting data points emerging from Kerala, the forerunner of several initiatives in the Indian educational sector. According to Economic Review 2021, in tenth standard only 49% of students are girls. But out of all students enrolled in various arts and science colleges in Kerala, an impressive 65.3% are girls. At the graduate level, engineering is the only field of study where female admissions at 41.8% are lower than of males. But when we consider the much higher pass percentage of girls in the engineering stream, this difference is nullified. Does this trend reflect in other states of India too?

Latest data from the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) 2020-2021 report released by the Union ministry of education provides some interesting data points. Uttar Pradesh has the highest student enrolment in India. What is more interesting is that 50.9% of them are girls. Karnataka is another state where the proportion of girls enrolled, at 50.2%, is higher than boys. In Tamil Nadu, the percentage of girls in colleges is very close to that of boys. India‚Äôs gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education, calculated for 18-23 years age group, is 27.1. Our GER for males is 26.9. For females, it is 27.3. This growing gender gap in higher education might turn out to be one of the most transformative trends of our time.

But will men take a loss of thousands of years of dominance without resistance? Very unlikely. As women look for equally qualified partners, a male dominated society will likely place impediments in women‚Äôs freedom of choice. Men will react violently when women walk out on them. In the Malayalam language, a new word ‚Äòtheppu‚Äô has emerged to denote girls walking out on boys. The emergence of women‚Äôs power could run into resistance in multiple ways.

The women wrestler‚Äôs protest is not a random event. It has emanated from what‚Äôs often seen as a citadel of male superiority. This protest is backed by the confidence of an ever-growing number of educated women in India and the opportunities that a knowledge economy has to offer them for economic independence. Much like Claudette Colvin‚Äôs courageous act in the US, the women wrestlers‚Äô protest in India will mark yet another significant moment in the journey of Indian women forward.

He added one needs to be very watchful of the earnings downgrade cycle which will determine the stock market's direction. In an interview with Mint, Nadekar shared his views on the Indian economy and interest-rate trajectory also.

Edited excerpts:

What is your view on the domestic market for the rest of the year? Is the worst behind us?

Over the last one and a half years, the Indian equity market has delivered a flat return. During this period the performance of the equity market was challenged by run-away inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates.

The rise in the cost of capital led to a fall in the equity valuations which dragged stocks down.

However, relatively strong operating performance and strong earnings growth of corporates in the listed space recouped the drag on valuations due to higher interest rates delivering overall flat returns.

I believe the bulk of the drag on the markets due to high inflation and high-interest rates is behind us. However, the double whammy of inflation/higher price levels and high cost of capital are resulting in demand slowdown and sluggish economic growth.

As demand slows down, operating margin recovery from falling commodity prices could be challenged as companies trade pricing power to volume growth.

This phenomenon has thrown the equity markets into a phase which is generally known as the earnings downgrade cycle where the key risk is lower than expected corporate profitability.

In the quarter ahead the returns from Indian equity markets will be governed by how this equity downgrade cycle plays out. For the recently concluded March 2023 results season, earnings downgrades were much less than what the market feared.

Relatively resilient earnings of corporate India coupled with a near consensus that central banks would pause the interest rate hike cycle has led to the recent sigh of a relief rally in the market.

Of course, the reversal of FII (foreign institutional investors) flows in favour of Indian markets has only further aided this rally. Does this mean that the worst is over for the Indian equity markets? Maybe, yes! However, one swallow doesn‚Äôt make a summer.

It would be premature to declare, based on the relatively strong earnings performance of the March 2023 quarter, that the earnings downgrade cycle which the market is fearful of would not be meaningful.

Globally, there are still fears of the US economy getting into recession in the second half of 2023. The poor earnings performance of broader US companies does support this view.

Any such global slowdown would be counterproductive for Indian businesses not to mention that the consumption side of the Indian economy which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of GDP continues to struggle with the growth. So one needs to be very watchful of the earnings downgrade cycle which will determine the stock market's direction.

India is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Has the market discounted this possibility? What could derail the economic growth of the country?

Yes! Indian economy today is undoubtedly one of the fastest growing economies in the world and more importantly at a size of $3.2 trillion GDP.

For the March 2023 quarter, India‚Äôs GDP growth stood at 6.1 per cent compared to 4.5 per cent for China ($18 trillion GDP), 4 per cent for Brazil ($1.6 trillion), 1.6 per cent for the United States ($23 trillion), one per cent for the Euro Zone ($14.5 trillion) or 5 per cent for Indonesia ($1.2 trillion), 6.4 per cent for Philippines ($0.4 trillion) and 3.3 per cent for Vietnam at $0.4 trillion economy.

Having said that, I think that the current growth rate of the Indian economy is still not reflecting its true potential.

Over the last five-six years, several initiatives were taken by the Government of India to fundamentally alter the fabric of the Indian economy.

The economy is getting formalised through various measures like demonetisation, GST implementation, Jan Dhan schemes, DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer), consolidation of public sector banks, improved legal measures like the RERA Act for the real estate sector or Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code for the banking sector.

Few of these changes were disruptive in nature and have held back the economy from achieving its full growth potential.

The crisis which snowballed into NBFC and the real estate crisis also didn‚Äôt help during this period. This was followed by Covid -19 pandemic which first through the lockdowns and then through global supply chain disruptions has led to sub-par economic growth for the country during this period.

I believe, as the domestic and global economy stabilises over the next few quarters, the Indian economy has the potential to move into a structural higher growth orbit.

India is also benefiting from the fact that post-Covid-19, the world is looking for an alternative to China as a global manufacturing hub.

This has expanded the addressable market opportunity and improved the growth prospects for various sectors in India such as pharma, chemicals, textile, and manufacturing across electricals, electronics and engineering products.

Current market valuations with Nifty50 trading at 22.4 times the price/earnings ratio (P/E) based upon trailing twelve-month earnings (trailing twelve-month P/E ) is less than the last 10 years' average of 22.6 times trailing twelve-month P/E.

As explained above if the growth rates for the country were to move up structurally, the current market valuations are clearly not fully discounting this higher growth potential of the country.

Relative stress in the rural economy is further challenged by a weak monsoon, fears of a global recession coming true in the second half of 2023, any adverse geopolitical development which disrupts the capital markets or any political instability in the country as we enter an election year in 2024 would be some of the factors which can derail the economic growth of the country.

What sectors are you positive about at this juncture? What sectors are you cautious about?

I am positive about auto, BFSI, capital goods and export-led manufacturing sectors. Some of the consumer-facing companies have also seen valuation normalising during the recent market corrections, which can be looked at. I am cautious about sectors which have high government interference in view of upcoming elections.

Q4 numbers of India Inc. were broadly in line with expectations. Can we see an upgrade in Nifty?

Q4FY23 earnings season was broadly in line with expectations, however, there is a wide divergence across sectors. Uncertainty in demand across sectors is due to the upcoming monsoon, geopolitical scenario, and upcoming elections.

But we can also see margin expansion in a few sectors due to a fall in commodity prices. I prefer a wait-and-watch approach towards the market.

Market sentiment has improved. Is it time to start looking at growth funds?

Growth companies generally have high earnings multiples, which got hurt disproportionately as interest rates rose sharply. The possible end of the rising rate cycle bodes well for growth stocks‚Äô valuation.

But like mentioned earlier there are fears of an economic slowdown globally which could hurt the high growth expectations of these companies.

It would be prudent to be stock specific and selective about the growth companies rather than taking a blanket thematic call. Having said this, with valuations offering comfort one can slowly and gradually start allocating to growth funds.

What is your view on the rate hike trajectory? What should be the investment strategy during the period of a prolonged pause in rate hikes?

Given that Inflation is moderating, and the economy is slowing down, there is no great urge to hike the interest rates any further. But given the stickiness of inflation and a very strong labour market, central banks globally would prefer a wait-and-watch policy. This might mean there is a prolonged pause on the interest rates.

Investment strategy during this period should be selective in nature focusing on companies showing growth visibility and valuation at reasonable prices. Having said that interest-sensitive sectors like real estate, auto and NBFCs could be a more direct beneficiary of the rate pause.

From the business perspective, Individual company dynamics on demand and inflationary movement on input cost will be the more dominant factors for earnings and stock price movement.

218,mint,India has a good shot at slowly ascending global value chains,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/indias-mobile-phone-exports-an-initial-success-story-with-lessons-from-china-s-value-chain-densification-11686678198047.html,13 Jun 2023,,"The splendid increase in mobile phone exports in recent years has been a success story for the Indian economy. Shipments of mobile phones assembled in India have increased by more than ten times over the past six years. And they have tripled over the past three years. Such assembly depends on imported inputs that flow across national borders with minimal tariff barriers. Some of these inputs require sophisticated technology. Assembly is just putting together inputs that others have produced. Hence the worry that there is very little value addition in the Indian factories that are now part of the sprawling supply chains of global consumer electronics majors such as Apple and Samsung.

Such criticism fails to consider that entire supply chains will not move into India in one dramatic swoop. It will be a gradual process. There will necessarily be two stages‚Äîfirst, the assembly of the finished product from imported inputs, followed by the domestic production of intermediate goods that go into a mobile phone. In that sense, what has been achieved recently is an important first step. The ‚Äúdensification"" of supply chains for mobile phones still lies in the uncertain future.

In 2005, three business school professors decided to look inside the latest iPod from Apple. Kenneth L. Kraemer, Greg Linden and Jason Dedrick were trying to figure out how the value in the then-iconic gizmo was being distributed across various points of the supply chain. They found that almost half of the value went to Apple, for its design, branding and intellectual property. The rest was distributed among various input suppliers. The assembly of the iPod was done in China, which captured barely 5% of the total value of the music player.

Fast forward to the year 2009. The iPhone has been launched with the tag line ‚ÄúDesigned in California, Assembled in China"" famously embossed on the phone. China is already the base for the assembly of iPhones sold across the world. Firms operating in China capture only a sliver of the value added in every iPhone 3G, both in terms of the cost of production as well as the retail price. China continues to play a big role in terms of final output, but a very minor role in terms of value addition.

Does that change in subsequent years? The answer to this question is important for India at this early stage of our mobile phone exports story. In 2019, Yuqing Xing, an economist at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, investigated the entrails of the latest iPhone X to see how value was now generated in the supply chain. He found clear evidence that China had begun to move up the iPhone value chain.

China was now accounting for a quarter of the cost of manufacturing the iPhone X and a tenth of the retail price. This was six and eight times higher than the comparable numbers for the iPhone 3G in 2009. Yuqing reported in a research paper that ten Chinese companies were now involved in the manufacture of key iPhone X components such as the battery pack, printed circuit boards, glass cover, camera module and parts of the touchscreen module. It was no longer just an assembly operation by Foxconn in China.

There is now a fair bit of research on how China has used an initial entry into a global supply chain as an opportunity to build forward and backward linkages within the country. Moving from the assembly of final consumer goods to the domestic production of intermediate goods is a key task. Such densification of supply chains has enabled China to move up the global value chain, create a strategic advantage, and make it much more difficult to move supply chains out of the country. Also, moving up the value chain enables a country to increase the share of exports in its GDP even at the same level of aggregate exports. There are lessons for India here in the years ahead.

How much of this is because of the natural process of technology spillovers and how much because of explicit industrial policy run by the government will always be a matter of debate. It is not just about gizmos rolled out by Apple. Another article published in 2019 against the backdrop of an escalating trade war between the US and China was written by Hiau Looi Kee of the World Bank and Heiwai Tang of Hong Kong University, and it showed that China is moving up global value chains in a range of industries. Their big policy conclusion is that trade liberalization as well as foreign direct investment are key to increasing the domestic value added in the exports of any country.

None of this is easy. However, there are two big lessons here.

First, the initial success in mobile phone exports need not be dismissed as mere assembly using screwdriver technology. It can be the first step in acquiring a deeper supply chain ecosystem.

Second, densification of supply chains needs to be promoted through the easing of domestic constraints on manufacturing, rather than through trade barriers, something that, in an older context, Jagdish Bhagwati and V.K. Ramaswami had shown in a landmark paper way back in 1963.

219,mint,RBI's guv Shaktikanta Das expects disinflation process to be slow in India,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/shaktikanta-das-disinflation-process-likely-to-be-slow-but-economy-remains-among-fastest-growing-in-2023-11686667468828.html,13 Jun 2023,,"A day after India's CPI inflation touched over 2-year low of 4.25%, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Tuesday said, the disinflation process is likely to be low. He reteriated that the latest two pauses in repo rate is not pivotal and not a definitive change in policy direction. However, in all likelihood, he sees India to remain remain among the fastest growing large economies in 2023.

At the Summer Meetings organised by Central Banking, London, UK, Shaktikanta Das said, ""the cumulative impact of our monetary policy actions over the last one year is still unfolding and yet to materialise fully.""

RBI has lowered its CPI inflation projection to 5.1% for the fiscal year 2023-24. However, Das said, ""it would still be well above the target.""

Inflation eased sharply to the lowest level in over two years at 4.25% in May 2023 ‚Äî this is also near the RBI''s lower tolerance limit of 4%.

He added, ""as per our current assessment, the disinflation process is likely to be slow and protracted with convergence to the inflation target of 4 per cent being achieved over the medium-term.""

Based on this realisation and with a view to assess the impact of past actions, he added, ""we decided on a pause in the April and June 2023 meetings, but clarified unequivocally that this not a pivot ‚Äì not a definitive change in policy direction.""

According to Das, recognising that explicit guidance in a rate tightening cycle is inherently fraught with risks, the MPC has also eschewed from providing any future guidance on the timing and level of the terminal rate.

In recent times, Das highlighted that especially since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks ‚Äì who are at the core of monetary and financial systems ‚Äì have been called to do ‚Äúheavy lifting"" well beyond their traditional mandate. Central banks have navigated through unchartered waters during the three black swan events ‚Äì the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the unprecedented scale and pace of global monetary policy normalisation ‚Äì all in the span of three years.

Further, he mentioned, ""more recently, central banks had to quickly change gears from providing stimulus to pandemic ravaged economies to battling inflation with all ammunition at their disposal. Even as the battle against inflation was ongoing, the banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) posed the awkward trade-off between financial stability and price stability.""

""This extraordinary period of global turbulence has indeed been extremely challenging for central banks and central banking,"" he added.

But Das believes India is on its path to remain among the fastest growing large economies.

He said, ""Indian economy has also made rapid gains in openness and has gradually integrated with the global economy over the years. Consequently, it is getting increasingly exposed to the vagaries of global headwinds.""

However, Das also said, it pertinent to note that India‚Äôs growth in the last few years is mainly driven by robust domestic demand, especially private consumption and investment, amidst the global slowdown.

Looking ahead, he added, ‚Äúwe expect real GDP to grow by 6.5 per cent during 2023-24. In all likelihood, India will remain among the fastest growing large economies in 2023.""

221,mint,Impasse in free trade talks as Israeli concerns grow over Indian IT influx,https://www.livemint.com/economy/indiaisrael-free-trade-talks-stalled-over-movement-of-indian-it-professionals-and-mismatched-economies-11686500170051.html,12 Jun 2023,,"New Delhi: Free trade talks between India and Israel have hit the skids over the movement of Indian IT professionals and the perception that Israel would stand to gain more from the mismatch in the size of the two economies, two people privy to the negotiations said.

The first disagreement stemmed from a cap on the movement of Indian IT professionals in Israel due to the country‚Äôs low labour absorption capacity. The issue assumed significance as the negotiations were largely centred around the services sector, with most goods trade having already been liberalized.

‚ÄúThe problem is the size difference. India expects Israel to allow Indian IT workers to work in Israel. Israel cannot allow too many because of its internal unemployment issues. Israel just gave India an allowance of 42,000 workers‚Äî34,000 for construction and 8,000 caregivers,"" said one of the persons cited above.

This person said both the minister of economy and foreign affairs of Israel visited India recently and ‚Äúthe FTA (free trade agreement) is still a matter to discuss"".

‚ÄúAn FTA at the moment is challenging due to a wide gap in the size of the economies of the two countries. And an agreement would largely be in Israel‚Äôs favour so it is not in India‚Äôs interest to go ahead with the same,"" the other person said. Trade experts said an FTA between the two countries could prove to be crucial for Indian agriculture as the Israeli agri- tech industry is fairly advanced and could help India achieve greater efficiency and productivity at a time geo-political tensions and climate change have posed food security challenges.

Sunitha Raju, professor at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade said: ‚ÄúIndia should not be only focused on movement of IT workers. India should leverage Israel‚Äôs expertise. Israel is known for its adaptive, productivity enhancing agriculture technology. We should negotiate for access to this technology that can help us to upgrade our water resources and agricultural productivity.""

The Indian economy is the world‚Äôs fifth largest with a gross domestic product of $3.5 trillion while Israel‚Äôs is roughly the size of $500 billion. While Indian exports to Israel in calendar year 2022 stood at $7.59 billion, Israeli exports to India were $3.94 billion as per the UN‚Äôs COMTRADE database on international trade.

Indian exports were driven by petroleum products, which comprised 65% of total exports in FY23. Other traditional exports such as gems and jewellery, engineering goods, electronic goods and pharma exports surged 35-115%.

Israeli stakeholders agreed the two countries should break the logjam. ‚ÄúThe parties should not give up on the FTA discussions, or other trade agreements. The partnership between India and Israel is strategic, thus, viewing the FTA through pure economic glasses is not right. I am sure that the parties can reach even a partial agreement that can progress the bilateral trade to greater heights. We are touching the $10 bn mark and it can easily reach $15 bn, if only an FTA or other trade agreement is signed,"" Anat Bernstein-Reich, President, Israel-Asia Chamber of Commerce said.

During his visit to India in May, foreign minister Eli Cohen spoke about Israel‚Äôs intention to pursue an FTA with India. Cohen spoke of boosting bilateral trade volumes to $20 billion.

He also said Israel could act as a bridge between the East and West by ferrying Indian goods from the Indian Ocean and sending them forward to European markets.

Talks for an FTA have been on since 2010, when the first round of negotiations were held in New Delhi.

Queries emailed to the commerce and industry ministry, ministry of external affairs and Israel‚Äôs embassy in New Delhi remained unanswered till press time."
222,mint,India's GDP expanding 6-6.3% in Q1: Moody's,https://www.livemint.com/news/indias-gdp-expected-to-clock-6-6-3-growth-in-june-quarter-moodys-11686465092434.html,11 Jun 2023,,"The Indian economy is expected to clock a 6-6.3% growth in the June quarter, Moody's on Sunday. It flagged risks of fiscal slippage arising from weaker-than-expected government revenues in the current fiscal.

Moody's growth estimate is lower than the 8% projection for the first quarter made by the Reserve Bank last week.

In an interview with news agency PTI, Moody's Investors Service Associate Managing Director Gene Fang said India has a relatively high level of general government debt at around 81.8% of GDP for 2022-23, and low debt affordability.

India, he said, has a high growth potential and its credit strengths include a stable domestic financing base for government debt, as well as a sound external position.

""We expect India's growth to come in around 6-6.3 per cent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, which remains relatively flat from the 6.1 per cent recorded in the final quarter of fiscal 2022-23,"" Fang said.

While household demand is likely to see an improvement given the moderation in both headline and core inflation readings, lagged effects of higher interest rates pose some risks on gross fixed capital formation, in particular, Fang added.

Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is an indicator of investment in the economy.

Fang said as a 'Baa3' rated sovereign, India's strengths lie in its large and diversified economy with a high growth potential, which is evident in the relatively strong growth forecast this year despite the weaker global economic outlook.

The government has largely met its fiscal objectives over the past two years, assuaging concerns on fiscal policy, he said.

The fiscal deficit, which is the difference between government expenditure and revenue, narrowed to 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2022-23 from 6.7 per cent in 2021-22.

In the current fiscal, the deficit is budgeted to come in lower at 5.9 per cent of GDP.

""As the government balances the commitment to longer-term fiscal sustainability against its more immediate priority of supporting the economy amid high inflation and weak global demand, and ahead of general elections due by May 2024, we expect some risks of fiscal slippage arising from possibly weaker-than-expected government revenues,"" Fang said.

For the full 2023-24 and 2024-25 fiscals, Moody's projects economic growth at 6.1 per cent and 6.3 per cent, respectively. On a calendar year basis, Moody's expects growth to be 5.5 per cent in 2023, which could improve to 6.5 per cent in 2024.

In its monetary policy last week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) projected India's GDP to expand by 6.5% in the current fiscal, on the back of supportive domestic demand conditions. For the June quarter, it projected growth at 8 per cent. For Q2 at 6.5 per cent, Q3 at 6 per cent, and Q4 at 5.7 per cent.

Earlier in May, Moody's had said that India's GDP had crossed $3.5 trillion in 2022 and will be the fastest-growing G-20 economy over the next few years, but reform and policy barriers could hamper investment. In a research report, the US-based agency said that bureaucracy could slow approval processes in obtaining licences and setting up businesses, prolonging project gestation. With India's position as the world's most populous country and the fifth-largest economy, these challenges could impede investment in the country's manufacturing and infrastructure sectors, it had added.

Moody's has a 'Baa3' sovereign credit rating on India, with a stable outlook. Baa3 is the lowest investment grade rating.

All three global rating agencies -- Fitch, S&P, and Moody's -- have the lowest investment grade rating on India, with a stable outlook. The ratings are looked at by investors as a barometer of the country's creditworthiness and impact borrowing cost.

Fang told PTI that India has a relatively high level of general government debt, estimated at around 81.8 per cent of GDP for fiscal 2022-23, compared with the Baa-rated median of around 56 per cent.

The country also has low debt affordability, in terms of general government interest payments as a percentage of revenues, which for India is estimated at 26 per cent for fiscal 2022-23, compared with the Baa median of around 8.4 per cent.

The overall health of the agricultural sector has a bearing on how well-off the stock market will be. In case, if monsoon does not meet forecasts, it will undoubtedly have a sever effect on the country's economy.

Rural areas of the country provide a sizable share of the income for Indian companies. While some businesses, such as those selling seeds, agrochemicals, fertilisers, etc., are directly involved in the agriculture industry, other businesses, such as those in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and automotive sectors, indirectly profit from a healthy rural economy. Banking, non-bank financial institutions (NBFCs), and microfinance organisations are other sectors whose performance is influenced by the state of the rural economy.

In a recent report, Global brokerage, Barclays stated that the monsoon of 2023 made a delayed landing in India on June 8. However, a tardy arrival does not necessarily indicate that it will proceed poorly. More important variables will be the distribution of rainfall and the likely emergence of an El Ni√±o.

On June 8, five days later than expected and about a week later than typical, the Indian Meteorology Department (IMD) formally declared the start of the monsoon. As a result, rainfall between June 1 and 8 was around 60% below average, which has slowed the start of the monsoon season. With the arrival of the monsoon rains, this number should begin to improve, according to the brokerage's assessment.

‚ÄúThe late arrival in itself is not a material development, as the monsoon‚Äôs arrival tends to vary year to year, and the onset is not indicative of the progress through the season. Geographical distribution of rainfall over the course of the next four months and effects of of a potential El Ni√±o weather pattern will be closely watched for their effects on sowing, food production and inflation,"" said the brokerage in its report.

The global brokerage states in its report that the IMD maintained its expectation for a ‚Äònormal‚Äô monsoon and expected total rainfall to be 96% of the long-period average in its second long-range forecast.

Top 5 monsoon picks of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd

Due to the monsoon's considerable influence on the Indian economy, its arrival is expected to be advantageous for agriculture and crucial in boosting rural demand, which will support agrochemicals, fertilisers, and rural consumer stocks.

Here are some stocks picked by domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, where investors stand to gain from a good monsoon. Let's look at the technical views.

Finolex Pipes: The brokerage stated that the stock is trading at the 20-week average and that it is finding support at the daily scale's 100 EMA, which is building momentum for higher levels.

Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd: The brokerage said that the stock has formed a pole and flag pattern on the daily scale which has positive implications.

Tata Consumer: The stock has started a new upward trend and has retested the breakout zone on the weekly scale, signalling strength.

Coromandel International: With price trading above averages on a daily basis, it has found support at the 20-month average and is slowly moving higher.

Bata India: The price has set up a base in the lower zone and has been making higher highs during the past three months, indicating a good trend.

225,mint,How ‚Çπ2000 notes withdrawal helped RBI to maintain status quo on interest rate?,https://www.livemint.com/economy/rbi-monetary-policy-how-rs-2000-notes-withdrawal-helped-rbi-to-maintain-status-quo-on-interest-rate-explained-11686202435835.html,08 Jun 2023,,"RBI monetary policy: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das today declared the RBI monetary policy committee (MPC) meting outcome keeping status quo on interest rate. The RBI MPC members unanimously decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent as banks have enough liquidity to meet their lending demands in near term. The RBI governor re-iterated that RBI MPC decided to maintain status quo as money supply surged 10.10 per cent YoY whereas non-food bank credit grew 15.6 per cent in this time.

Highlighting upon the money supply leading to surplus money at banking system, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, ""The average daily absorption under the LAF increased to ‚Çπ1.7 lakh crore during April-May from ‚Çπ1.4 lakh crore in February-March. Money supply (M3) expanded by 10.1 per cent y-o-y and non-food bank credit by 15.6 per cent as on May 19, 2023. India‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves were placed at $ 595.1 billion as on June 2, 2023.""

However, experts believe that surplus liquidity in the banking and Indian economy has become possible after withdrawal of ‚Çπ2000 notes. However, they maintained that better-than-expected GDP of India, strong GST collection, inflation at lower levels of the targeted 2-6 per cent inflation, etc. have also played its role in this RBI monetary policy meeting decision to keep repo rate unchanged.

‚Çπ 2000 notes withdrawal doing the trick

Giving credit to ‚Çπ2000 notes withdrawal for this status quo outcome from the RBI MPC meeting, Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist and Executive Director at Anand Rathi said, ""Today's RBI monetary policy rate pause was anticipated. In the wake of a greater-than-anticipated decline in inflation in the recent past, it was anticipated that the monetary policy would shift from a liquidity withdrawal to a neutral stance. However, the MPC has decided to maintain the current stance by a majority vote. This is due to the fact that the demonetization of Rs. 2,000 banknotes has significantly contributed to the recent increase in liquidity.""

However, Anand Rathi expert maintained that RBI's projections indicate that RBI's inflation target of 4% will be exceeded each month of the current fiscal year. While the continuation of the RBI's policy stance is somewhat disappointing, the central bank's cautious approach in light of upside risks, such as the potential impact of El Nino on India's monsoon and the continuation of monetary tightening by the world's major central banks, appears justified and well-articulated. Therefore, we anticipate that the monetary policy announcement will have no effect on the financial markets.

On why RBI decided to maintain status quo on interest rates despite surplus liquidity after ‚Çπ2000 notes withdrawal, Sandeep Bagla, CEO at Trust Mutual Fund said, ""It is a pause, and the possibility of the next move being a cut is far higher than that of a hike. Growth remains resilient and the inflation while moderating now, could rise in the future as labour market remains tight and wage-inflation spiral remains a distinct danger. Australia and Canada have raised rates after a pause. We are not out of the woods yet. Liquidity surplus will have to be reduced as Rs.2000 notes seep into the banking system liquidity. It is quite possible that market yields rise by a few basis points as RBI waits for more economic cues amidst continued global contradictory cues on inflation and growth fronts.""

On macro factors that helped RBI maintain status quo on interest rate, Anu Aggarwal, President and Head of Corporate Banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank said, ""Leaving the policy rates unchanged was expected with inflation cooling down partly due to base effect and partly with oil at $70 (compared to $ 115 in June 2022). With global macro anyways pulling businesses down, RBI‚Äôs action will provide much-needed support to local demand and growth.""

Kotak Mahindra Bank official went on to add that interest rate stability will boost Capex plans, the bulk of which has so far been driven by the Government. The multiplier effect of investment spending is much higher than that of Consumption spending.

Recently, Germany reported a second-successive quarter of contraction in its economy in the three months ended 31 March. While the decline was mild, it is now in a recession, which is defined as two quarters in a row of output fall. Much of Germany‚Äôs troubles are due to the rise in energy prices driven by Russia‚Äôs retaliatory moves to restrict natural gas supplies in response to sanctions on it for invading Ukraine. Surprisingly, the Russian economy seems to be surviving rather well, which raises questions over the efficacy of the West‚Äôs sanctions. That aside, with Euro Zone‚Äôs biggest economy now shrinking, others in the common market union will get affected too. This could show in Europe‚Äôs trade in the upcoming quarters. Adding to the troubles is inflation, which is ruling well above tolerance levels despite having eased from its peak. This will tie the hands of policymakers in acting too enthusiastically to prop up growth. In the UK, inflation is above 8%. Across the Atlantic in the US, the story isn‚Äôt too different, with inflation, at 4.9% in April, more than double the 2% rate the Federal Reserve is targeting.

The debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road has brought relief. But it is the Federal Reserve‚Äôs action on which the prospect of a recession may now hinge. It has reiterated its tough stance against inflation, although investors seem to be betting this to be more of a posturing, and that its rate hike cycle is over. Should the Fed surprise, though, the US, and thus the world, may be at risk of a deep slump. China‚Äôs economy, the world‚Äôs second-largest, also is tottering, with output having expanded an uncharacteristically weak 3% in 2022. In this broadly gloomy canvas, India stands out, as the International Monetary Fund has described, as a ‚Äúbright spot"". The 7.2% gross domestic product (GDP) expansion in 2022-23 indicates that it is holding up better than the rest. While the low contribution of India‚Äôs exports in its GDP, and in global exports, make it less vulnerable to any external shock, New Delhi‚Äôs efforts to grow exports‚Äîwith some welcome success‚Äîhave deepened trade linkages lately. So, we can‚Äôt expect to remain insulated. In addition, our financial markets are connected deep-enough to serve as a channel for any external instability to hit our shores.

Be that as it may, there are opportunities that India can eye. With much of the industrialized world busy staving off a recession, our economy could be a haven of tranquillity, especially as the world tries to de-risk itself, even decouple entirely, from China. As this causes big investment shifts, India‚Äôs continued expansion could serve as a big draw. But we must not take ourselves, by virtue of being counted in the big-league of global economies, as a natural choice. Smaller Asian economies such as Vietnam, Indonesia and even Bangladesh are just as eagerly trying to woo investors in this China+1 trade‚Äîand with notable success. So, we‚Äôll need to make aggressive efforts to pitch our economy. New Delhi has made significant moves by easing hurdles to business and it is also relying significantly on the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme. These have helped, no doubt. But our efforts need to go farther to capitalize on an extraordinary opportunity of this scale. We need visibly greater engagement with stakeholders."
228,mint,Morgan Stanley‚Äôs report on India is an exercise in cherry-picking,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/morgan-stanley-research-s-report-on-india-s-economy-cherry-picks-data-and-leaves-out-nuance-ignoring-important-details-11686075052965.html,07 Jun 2023,,"A fundamental skill needed to be an investment manager or stockbroker is the ability to talk up future prospects of the economy one operates in. Common sense suggests that fund managers should talk up the prospects of specific stocks, but that doesn‚Äôt happen often because many fund managers aren‚Äôt allowed to do that. Also, if the idea is to attract investments from foreigners ‚Äî who are more interested in making a country-level allocation than investing in specific stocks ‚Äî it makes more sense to talk up economic prospects.

So, it‚Äôs hardly surprising that many reports on India have been published over the years in which the future prospects of the economy are talked up to make a case for investing in stocks. This formula has been followed for two decades now.

One such report, published recently by Morgan Stanley Research (MSR), states that India has transformed in less than a decade. It builds its case by highlighting 10 big changes in the Indian economy, while cherry-picking data and leaving out nuance.

Take the gross foreign direct investment (FDI) coming into India, which the report shows as an upward sloping curve. The gross figure doesn‚Äôt take into account the repatriation/disinvestment that happens every year. It also doesn‚Äôt take into account the increasing size of India‚Äôs economy. Once we do that, the figure for 2022-23 stands at 1.2% of GDP, having peaked at 3.5% in 2008-09. In the past 10 years, it has ranged from 1.2% to 2.1%.



A case is made for how India‚Äôs corporate income tax rate is now in line with that of its peers. In fact, corporate income tax collections peaked at 3.9% of GDP in 2007-08 and fell to 3.5% in 2018-19, the year before the pandemic struck. The ratio was at 3% in 2021-22 and 3.1% in 2022-23.

The post-2019 fall in corporate tax collections has been due to the cut in the corporate income tax rate in September 2019. Here‚Äôs the thing: the corporates have earned windfall profits post-2019 because of lower interest rates and increasing economic formalisation.

Indeed, the sample of more than 30,000 companies, both listed and unlisted, tracked by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy suggests that from 2018-19 to 2021-22, total sales went up 21%. Profit after tax ‚Äî thanks to lower tax rates and lower interest rates ‚Äî rose by a whopping 237%. In comparison, tax provisions of these companies increased just 37%. Clearly, the corporate tax-rate cut has come at a great cost, with individuals having to make up for it by paying more tax.

Another point made in the report is that inflation has been lower post-2014. That‚Äôs true. Nonetheless, in 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14, the average price of the Indian basket of crude oil was more than $100 per barrel, which hasn‚Äôt happened since. A mention of this was necessary.

Then there is that favourite of fund managers ‚Äì the huge amount of money coming into mutual funds (MFs) through systematic investment plans (SIP). In the past few years this has been an upward sloping curve, with the amount of money being invested into MFs through SIPs rising every year. The MSR report cites this upward sloping curve as another example of something that has changed in the past few years.

In 2016-17, investments through SIPs averaged ‚Çπ3,660 crore a month. By 2022-23, they had jumped to ‚Çπ13,000 crore a month. MSR calls this India‚Äôs ‚Äò401(K) moment‚Äô to make the data more palatable to a US audience.

The trouble is that nuance has gone missing again here. Investors make money through SIPs only if they hold on to their investments for a while. Nonetheless, as a recent consultation paper published by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) pointed out, only 3.1% of the MF units that investors redeemed in 2022-23 had been held for more than five years. In 2021-22 this was 2.6%. More than half of MF units are redeemed within a year of investment.

This clearly tells us that while investors are investing through SIPs, they are not holding on to their investments for long enough, meaning that equity investing will eventually turn out to be disappointing for them. The MSR report doesn‚Äôt get into these details.

Of course, like every other report these days, MSR‚Äôs points out how Indians have taken to digital payments like fish to water. While this suggests convenience for consumers and better data for the government and financial firms, it in no way suggests an increased ability to consume things. Most of these transactions are of low value and were already happening in cash.

There is also no mention of the K-shaped economic recovery after the pandemic. Two-wheeler sales in 2022-23 were similar to those in 2014-15. While the sale of entry-level cars has crashed, there are waiting periods for SUVs. Airline travel in 2022-23 almost recovered to pre-pandemic levels, but non-suburban rail travel was 29% lower than in 2018‚Äì19.

Sluggish rural consumption finds no mention either.The volumes of FMCG companies ‚Äì the number of units of various products sold by these companies ‚Äì has not been looking good for a while. As Ritesh Tewari, chief financial officer of Hindustan Unilever, said in a 27 Aprilearnings call: ‚ÄúWe need to be mindful that FMCG market volumes have been declining for almost a year and a half. Rural market volume is still declining.""

Then there is the case of work demanded under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), India‚Äôs work guarantee scheme. Last month 31.74 million households demanded work under it ‚Äì more than has ever been demanded in the month of May, except in 2020, just after the pandemic broke out.

In fact, the work demanded by households during April-May has been the highest ever for the first two months of a financial year ‚Äì even higher than in April-May 2020. This is yet another indicator of the K-shaped economic recovery that India is currently experiencing.

Further, direct-benefit transfers to the population have gone up over the years. This spending stood at ‚Çπ3.82 trillion or 1.9% of GDP in 2019‚Äì20. It has since jumped to ‚Çπ6.67 trillion or 2.45% of GDP in 2022‚Äì23. This increase again indicates that the financial situation of many Indians is precarious.

Interestingly, the report has a chart showing the money invested by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) in Indian stocks and debt. FPIs brought in the most money into India in the years before 2017-18 (Take a look at the accompanying chart). Of course 2020-21, when Western central banks cut interest rates to almost zero, was an exception.

Finally, in 2015-16, India‚Äôs agriculture sector was around 4% bigger than manufacturing (in nominal terms). In 2022-23, agriculture was 25% bigger than manufacturing. This despite increasing tariff protection and programmes like production-linked incentives to encourage companies to make in India. The MSR report gives this a complete miss. The history of economic development tells us that no country has gone from developing to developed without moving people away from agriculture into manufacturing.



As economist Ha-Joon Chang writes inBad Samaritans ‚ÄîThe Guilty Secrets of Rich Nations & the Threat to Global Prosperity:‚ÄúHistory has repeatedly shown that the single most important thing that distinguishes rich countries from poor ones is basically their higher capabilities in manufacturing, where productivity is generally higher, and more importantly, where productivity tends to grow faster than agriculture and services.""

In India, the opposite seems to be happening. The government‚ÄôsPeriodic Labour Force Survey also bears this out. The latest annual data is available for the period July 2021 to June 2022. The proportion of the workforce in agriculture has gone up from 42.5% in 2018-19 to 45.5% in 2021-22.

All this leads us to the bigger point: How can any serious report on the Indian economy ignore all this important data? This can only be done when the idea is to cherry-pick to build a narrative and leave out any nuance.

This is not to say that everything is doomed. Not at all. The investment scene seems to be turning around. Bad loans of banks and corporate debt have both come down. Goods and services tax collections have improved thanks to better implementation (and high inflation). Services exports are also looking up.

Indeed, as has happened in the past, the stock market may do well irrespective of how the economy performs. The economy‚Äôs rising formalisation might be one reason for this. Second, if central banks in the West go back to a low interest rate policy, money might come pouring in and drive up stock prices like in 2020 and 2021.

229,mint,Can the Indian economy sustain its momentum?,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/can-the-indian-economy-sustain-its-momentum-11685955463251.html,05 Jun 2023,,"There‚Äôs cheerful news on the economy at last. Official estimates released last week show India‚Äôs GDP grew 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022-23 (FY23). The higher-than-expected growth lifted the full-year growth to 7.2%, rendering almost all projections pessimistic, including those of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which had predicted 6.8% growth.

Analysts are pleasantly surprised as the year saw high inflation, which forced the central bank to raise interest rates sharply, and a rise in uncertainty owing to the war in Ukraine. The 7.2% growth in FY23 came after 9.1% growth in FY22.

Many factors boosted growth in the fourth quarter of the year. The full-year growth was led by agriculture, which delivered extremely strong growth of 5.5% year-on-year in the quarter. It seems that bumper output in Madhya Pradesh may have more than made up for crop losses, if any, in Punjab and Haryana due to excess unseasonal rains there.

Second, exports of services were buoyant and net exports contributed as much as 1.4 percentage points to the overall growth figure, helped by a contraction of 4.1% in imports, which contributes positively to GDP growth.

Third, the output of both passenger and commercial vehicles grew smartly, recovering from the chips-shortage crisis. Fourth, air and rail traffic rebound sharply, led by the pent-up, post-lockdown demand for travel.

Fifth, the government‚Äôs sustained capex push in the union budget boosted the output of construction-related sectors such as steel and cement. Estimates show that gross fixed capital formation, an indicator of investment demand in the economy, grew 8.9% during the fourth quarter.

Sixth, financial services performed well with post-covid revival of bank credit. In fact services, construction, trade, hotels, finance and real estate all grew faster than projected, likely on the strength of pent-up demand. Seventh, the sharp fall in crude oil prices (trending below $73 a barrel) likely boosted economic activity.

Finally, the growth figures were no doubt helped by a low statistical base from the peak covid-19 year. Experts have also ascribed part of the buoyancy to methodological issues proving favourable ‚Äì such as the Central Statistical Organisation‚Äôs (CSO) use of single deflation rather than double deflation, which, they reckon, tends to lead to overestimation in growth during times of falling oil prices. (While the output and the inputs that go into production are deflated with their respective prices in other countries, in India, due to the paucity of price indices, both are deflated with just the output deflator, which creates a bias in times of sharp price movements.)

But these issues should not make us overly sceptical for two reasons: one, the methodology, with all its shortcomings, is followed consistently by the CSO. Second, the estimates are provisional and over the next two years will be refined by the CSO as per its policy.

In conclusion, while the economy has rebounded from the shock of covid-19, the key concern now is whether the fast growth is sustainable. Most economists project a slowdown in the momentum in FY24. This is because a red flag tempering the good news for the fourth quarter is the tepid 2.8% year-on-year growth in private consumption, which could be a sign of a slowdown in response to the RBI‚Äôs monetary tightening.

It‚Äôs early days, though, and the revisions to this figure will have to be monitored. This is important because private consumption will eventually determine private-investments growth, which is key for job creation.

The emerging global economic conditions will remain an important determinant along with the monsoon and other climate-related variables. But it cannot be understated that the biggest effect may come from policy responses. Sound policies will help the economy sustain its momentum.

The released growth estimates (subject to revisions, as already noted) confirm that covid-19 delivered a major shock to the economy. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2019 to 2023 is just 2.7%.

The impact of the lockdowns policy can also be seen from the estimates. Growth in agriculture (3.5%) during this period outpaced that in manufacturing (2.4%) as the lockdowns covered factories but not farms. Higher-quality GDP growth would have been possible if manufacturing GDP had performed as well as agriculture, given the implications for job creation and consumption demand.

FY23 manufacturing growth is estimated at 1.3%. Reviving this sector is something policymakers must focus on urgently if India‚Äôs impressive economic growth momentum is to be maintained."
230,mint,The FY23 growth story decoded in five charts,https://www.livemint.com/economy/the-fy23-growth-story-decoded-in-five-charts-11685897970751.html,05 Jun 2023,,"The Indian economy sprang a surprise last week by recording higher-than-expected growth in the March-ended quarter as well as in the full fiscal year 2022-23. The full-year growth was 7.2%, 20 basis points higher than analysts‚Äô consensus estimates and the March-quarter print was 6.1%, almost a percentage point higher than most estimates. Data on the central government‚Äôs finances, also released last week, showed satisfactory numbers, with the Centre meeting its targets for fiscal deficit, capital expenditure and tax collections for 2022-23. Mint decodes what lies beyond the headline numbers.

Barely Recovered

The Indian economy grew strongly for the second straight year after covid-related disruptions. The growth got a gigantic push from the construction sector and the ‚Äútrade, hotels, transport, communication and broadcasting services"" grouping, both of which grew in double digits. However, the year-on-year growth, while heartening, concealed the overall impact of the pandemic and the recovery thereafter. Despite a surge in 2022-23, the average annual growth rate since 2018-19, was a mere 2.5% for the trade and hotels segment. GDP has risen by just 3.4% per year on average in these four years, and gross value added (GVA) by 3.8%. Growth in manufacturing has been dismal, and mining and quarrying actually shrank in size relative to 2018-19. While India has shown resilience by recording a 7%-plus GDP growth, the pandemic losses continue to weigh on the size of the economy. The four-year average growth rate since 2018-19 helps adjust for the lockdown skews.

Trade Boost

In a year that was defined by worries over slowing global growth and trade, India‚Äôs GDP witnessed its foreign trade component bucking the trend in the March-ended quarter. It was the first time in four quarters that net exports (exports minus imports) had a positive impact on economic growth, adding 1.5 percentage points to headline GDP growth. Merchandise exports slowed down significantly in FY23, keeping the goods trade deficit on an upward trend despite a slowdown in imports. However, the services trade surplus was enough to result in an overall positive impact on economic growth. But like goods exports, services exports could also face a slowdown in the wake of global crises from technology companies to banks, and this is a cause for worry. Contracting imports may tilt the needle in favour of GDP, but it is not ideal for a growing economy, as it points to lack of demand, which, in turn, could lead to further slowdown.

Demand Woes

Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) number, a key proxy for consumption patterns, paints a worrying picture, as it grew a meagre 2.8% in Q4FY23. It was higher than 2.2% in Q3, but pales against the gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), a proxy for investments. With 8% and 8.9% growth in Q3 and Q4, respectively, GFCF contributed to India‚Äôs growth, highlighting the government‚Äôs efforts to push capital expenditure. The abysmal growth in consumption expenditure raises questions on whether the investment growth will sustain despite the apparent lack of demand. ‚ÄúWeaker private consumption still appears to be a worry, although it does not reconcile with the robust value-added growth of consumption-led sectors like trade, hotels, transport and communication services,"" said Madhavi Arora, lead economist, Emkay Global.

Tax Trends

The previous year ended on a satisfactory note for the central government, with its finances broadly in line with its revised estimates. However, while the tax collections were also in line with expectations, the tax-to-GDP ratio took a dip during the year.

Gross tax collections grew 10.4% in 2022-23, but this was significantly lower than the nominal GDP growth of 16.1%, resulting in gross tax-to-GDP ratio falling marginally to 11.3% from 11.5% the previous year. This was mainly on account of lower excise duty collections following the cuts on fuel last year. Going ahead, economists expect a slowdown in tax collections along with the anticipated slowdown in nominal growth. For the current year, the government has set a target of a 10.5% increase in tax collections‚Äîin line with its nominal GDP projection‚Äîwhich would mean the ratio could remain stuck at the same level, or may even decline further.

Forecast Revisions

The government's February estimate had pegged the GDP growth for 2022-23 at 7%. The better-than-expected figure has now encouraged economists to come up with more optimistic estimates for the ongoing fiscal year 2023-24 over the last week. State Bank of India raised its projection to 6.7%, up from 6.2% and the highest among all analysts. Kotak Institutional Equities also raised its estimate by 20 basis points. However, some analysts have refrained from upgrading their estimates citing possible downside risks. ‚ÄúInflation is expected to moderate in FY24, which is a positive for household budgets and consumption, but the rise in home loan EMIs and its impact on the budgets of urban households, contraction in exports and their impact on employment, and the impact of a potential El Nino on crops, food prices and farm incomes remains to be seen,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at Icra Ltd."

Minister of State for Finance, Dr Aisha Pasha, stated during a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance that Pakistan's only option is to return to the IMF. The committee also discussed the possibility of invoking the contempt of Parliament law against Finance Minister Ishaq Dar for his absence during the meeting.

Pakistan's economy is grappling with a severe inflationary crisis, reaching its highest rate since 1957. The country now finds itself with the highest inflation rate in Asia, surpassing even Sri Lanka. As of May 2023, the inflation rate stands at a staggering 38%, posing significant challenges for the government and the people of Pakistan.

Dr Pasha revealed that Pakistan had asked the IMF to consider lowering the external funding requirement based on updated data on the current account deficit, but the request was declined. She further explained that $3 billion was to be arranged after reaching a staff-level agreement, but the IMF insisted on demonstrating the $6 billion. Dr Pasha stressed that there was no alternative to going back to the IMF and there was no backup plan if negotiations failed.

Dr Aisha Pasha said, ""There is no option other than going back to the IMF, and I categorically say there is no Plan B.""

Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Dr Ramesh Kumar attributed the prolonged delay in restarting the IMF programme to Pakistan's foreign policy course. Dr Pasha noted that arrangements had been made by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the World Bank and Geneva Commitments for Pakistan to receive $4.5 billion, with the remaining $1.5 billion to be set up after reaching a staff-level agreement.

Finance Minister Dar, in a separate statement, expressed optimism about reaching a staff-level deal in June and assured that Pakistan's external financing was in order. Dr Pasha mentioned that Pakistan had shared its fiscal year 2020 budget with the IMF and was awaiting feedback, stating that the budget generally aligns with IMF recommendations. However, concerns were raised by committee members regarding the government's decision to share budget figures with the IMF but not with lawmakers, according to ANI.

The IMF has disbursed $3.9 billion of the overall $6.5 billion rescue package, with the remaining amount dependent on the completion of three outstanding reviews. The government's efforts to salvage the agreement and secure the necessary funding will continue as negotiations with the IMF persist.

Singh highlighted India‚Äôs historical economic strength, which accounted for over a quarter of the world‚Äôs GDP until the 17th century. However, he acknowledged that India‚Äôs prominence waned due to a weak military and political subjugation.

He emphasized the government‚Äôs commitment to rectify this situation by prioritizing the development of a strong, young, and technologically advanced armed forces. Efforts are also being made to eliminate a colonial mindset and foster self-reliance.

‚ÄúA strong military not only secures the borders, but also protects the culture & economy of a country. The goal is to build a strong, self-reliant and prosperous nation, which caters to its own needs as well as the requirements of friendly countries. This is an era of renaissance. It is time to re-establish India as a global superpower,"" Singh said.

Citing a report by Morgan Stanley, Singh referred to India‚Äôs transformation from being named among the ‚ÄúFragile 5"" economies in 2013 to its projected position as the third-largest economy by 2027. He regarded this as evidence of India‚Äôs remarkable economic growth. While acknowledging the term ‚Äúemerging power"" as relevant in the short term, Singh emphasized India‚Äôs long-term resurgence as it regains its place on the world economic stage.

Singh listed several government reforms aimed at facilitating economic growth, including direct tax reforms, the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), and measures to improve the ease of doing business. He noted that these reforms have led to revolutionary transformations across sectors, making India an attractive destination for foreign investors.

Regarding the defence sector, Singh highlighted efforts to achieve complete self-reliance in weapon and technology manufacturing. Notable initiatives include the notification of positive indigenisation lists and the establishment of defence industrial corridors in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. He emphasized the significant growth of the defence sector, evidenced by record defense production and all-time high defence exports in the financial year 2022-23.

Singh shared the prime minister‚Äôs vision for India to become a developed nation by 2047, focusing on sectors such as health, education, transportation, and border development. He emphasized the importance of social welfare, equal participation of women, and the creation of employment opportunities. Singh envisioned an India where citizens take pride in their culture, uphold democratic values, and contribute to global peace.

The defence minister called for collaboration between the public and private sectors to build a welfare state that ensures high-quality nutrition, housing, education, and healthcare for all. He envisioned an India where individuals are judged by their knowledge and character, not by their caste or religion. He encouraged a united India that defends itself and stands against injustice anywhere in the world.

The Indian economy grew 7.2% in 2022-23, beating analysts‚Äô estimates by 20 basis points, thanks to better-than-expected growth in agriculture, construction and the services sector. On the expenditure side, private final consumption expenditure grew 7.5%. While concerns over the revival of private consumption remain, its share in GDP has risen in the past few years. But the change for FY23 was only marginal from 58.3% to 58.5% , suggesting a fall in post-pandemic pent-up demand.

The possibility of El Nino‚Äôs effect on rainfall has led to worries about food production around the world. While the India Meteorological Department has reiterated its forecast of normal monsoon at 96% of long period average, it is at the lower end of the normal band of 96-104. Below normal monsoon has often resulted in decline in cereal production, a Mint analysis showed. At a time when cereal inflation is still in double digits, a possible decline in production may make matters worse.

The rise in income allowed the RBI to transfer a larger-than-budgeted dividend of ‚Çπ87,416 crore to the government, which could offset the impact of higher subsidy payout.

Seven Australian universities have reportedly banned or restricted the intake of Indian students from certain states, citing attrition. After securing admission in universities in 2022, many Indian students allegedly dropped out and moved to cheaper vocational institutes. Outbound students to Australia surged in FY23, with 52,000 getting student visas in the first six months alone, Mint reported. This was much higher than 42,627 student visas granted in the whole of FY22.

‚ÄúThe Indian economy remains resilient in the face of a challenging global environment, and we do not anticipate major domestic roadblocks in the year ahead,"" a statement from the CII said quoting Dinesh.

Apart from the capex push by the government, the resilience in the domestic economy comes from the healthy balance sheets of corporations and a well capitalised financial system, he said.

Dinesh also said India‚Äôs medium-term growth prospects are healthy and projected a 7.8% compounded annual growth rate in the FY22-31 period.

Capital investments, at a higher scale by the government and expected fresh ones by the private sector, will drive medium-term growth, along with productivity enhancing reforms such as GST, taxation and IBC, the statement said.

Dinesh also called for reforms in the areas of land, labour, agriculture and power, which the industry body believes are particularly important for making India a global manufacturing hub.

Dinesh suggested that the RBI could continue with its pause on rate increases.

‚ÄúRBI has already increased the key repo rate by a cumulative 250 basis points in the last fiscal, the lagged impact of which will be felt on the real sector of the economy this year...

In the fourth quarter, India's economy saw a significant increase and clocked a better-than-estimated growth.

The country's GDP grew by 6.1 percent in the March quarter of 2022-23, pushing the annual growth rate to 7.2 per cent.

The growth has propelled the country's economy to $3.3 trillion, setting the stage for achieving the $5 trillion target in the next few years.

While addressing the media, the newly elected CII President R Dinesh said India's GDP growth is expected to leapfrog to 7.8 per cent in the next decade (FY22-31) from 6.6 per cent previously recorded.

""We expect GDP growth in a range of 6.5-6.7 per cent in 2023-24, supported by strong domestic drivers and robust capex momentum of the government,"" Dinesh said.

During his address, he said that the government's structural reform agenda has enabled the country to become the highest growing economy in the current scenario, and we believe this can be sustained going forward.

""This year is very important in view of India assuming the G20 Presidency. The entire world is looking at India. In the last year, there has been a significant focus on India and the opportunities that arise from this are important for us,"" he added.

The industry body also expects the consumer price index (CPI) based retail inflation to fall within RBI's target range in 2023-24.

Dinesh further stressed that given the fast moderation in inflation, the Reserve Bank should continue with a pause in the short-term lending rate (repo rate) and also change its stance to neutral.

The retail inflation declined to an 18-month low of 4.7 per cent in April and the data for May is scheduled to be released later this month.

The retail inflation was 5.66 per cent in March 2023 and 7.79 per cent in the year-ago period.

The government has mandated the RBI to ensure inflation remains at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side.

In the last monetary policy, the central bank maintained a status quo on the interest rate front. Prior to that the RBI had raised the repo rate by 250 basis points in tranches beginning May 2022, in a bid to check high inflation.

CII also suggested a host of reforms which the government should undertake to boost India's growth potential.

UPI has been a revolution for the entire economy in large part due to rapid adoption by millennials and GenZs. It has accelerated the adoption of digital payments, and made making peer-to-peer payments easier for use cases such as bill splitting and money transfers.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will withdraw ‚Çπ2,000 denomination banknotes that were in circulation since 2016. This was announced by the central bank on May 19. The RBI has said banknotes in ‚Çπ2,000 denomination will continue to be legal tender. The central bank mentioned several reasons that influenced its decision to withdraw the currency notes.

Citing data from a report titled 'India Digital Payments Annual Report', RBI said UPI and digital payments increased tremendously in the last few years.

According to Satyajeet Kunjeer, Founder, of Deciml, the high adoption of UPI by vendors as well as buyers has definitely added to it becoming a convenient and preferred platform - in a matter of only 7 years. What‚Äôs even more interesting, however, is that alongside making spending/transacting easier - UPI has also served to become a central platform that is enabling several other associated financial services such as expense tracking, budgeting, saving, and investing.

As things stand today, it is highly likely that everyone - not just millennials - will come to rely entirely on digital financial services, he added.

E-commerce grew as UPI facilitated hassle-free online payments

UPI has also increased financial awareness by offering access to various financial services and investments, making millennials and GenZs more knowledgeable about their options. ‚ÄúIt has streamlined investment transactions, allowing for seamless investments in mutual funds, stocks, and alternative investments such as P2P lending and IPOs. UPI-enabled platforms provided real-time portfolio tracking, simplified SIPs, and lowered investment costs,"" said Neha Juneja, CEO, IndiaP2P.com

Unified Payments Interface (UPI)

UPI offers services from hundreds of banks and mobile payment apps, with no transaction fees. FinTech, banks, and telcos have adopted this platform and have further driven UPI growth through QR code placements at merchant point-of-sale (POS).

According to a PwC report titled ‚ÄúThe Indian Payments Handbook ‚Äì 2022-27"", UPI transactions are likely to reach 1 billion per day by 2026-27, accounting for 90 per cent of the retail digital payments in the country.

Production of electricity, refinery products, crude oil, and natural gas fell into the negative, marking the lowest core sector growth since the 0.7% growth recorded in October 2022.

Core sector growth stood at 9.5% in April 2022 and 3.6% in March 2023.

Electricity generation has the highest weightage of 19.85% in the core sector index.

‚ÄúElectricity again clocked negative growth of -1.4%. This is on a higher base of 11.8%. But this is also reflective of a lower level of industrial activity that has brought down demand. Domestic demand would have varied due to extreme conditions witnessed in different parts of the country. Unseasonal rains did lower the need for cooling, while extreme heat did cause an uptick in demand,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, said.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had earlier said Delhi‚Äôs primary weather station, the Safdarjung Observatory, has not recorded any heatwave in the pre-monsoon season for the first time since 2014.

Sabnavis said crude oil, natural gas, and refined products witnessed negative growth, reflecting lower demand, adding that benign global crude prices have a tendency to lower production of domestic crude oil as imports are preferred.

Global crude oil prices have been declining amid recessionary conditions in several Western countries owing to the war in Ukraine.

Brent, the global oil benchmark, has corrected to near $70 a barrel from as much as $120 in 2022. Europe‚Äôs largest economy, Germany, entered a recession in the first quarter of 2023.

Cement grew by 11.6% in preparation for future demand, as there is a lull once the monsoon starts, Sabnavis added.

Meanwhile, coal production growth declined to 9% in April this year, and fertilizer production growth soared to 23.5%, steel by 12.1%, and cement by 11.6%.

Experts said the negative net exports situation has improved for three consecutive quarters and aided the March quarter growth. They also said the drag from negative net exports on overall GDP could be lower, with an expected improvement in the trade balance in FY24.

Farm sector output expanded at a robust 5.5% adjusted for inflation, while the manufacturing sector rebounded from two consecutive quarters of contraction with a 4.5% growth in the fourth quarter, and the services sector‚Äôs strong expansion indicated that the pent-up demand that is boosting consumption after the pandemic is sustaining.

Construction saw a 10.4% growth in the quarter, while trade, hotels, transport, and communication and services related to broadcasting grew at 9.1%.

Chief economic adviser in the finance ministry V. Anantha Nageswaran said at a briefing after the GDP figures were released that private final consumption expenditure was catching up with the pre-pandemic trajectory at the level it would have been had the Covid-19 pandemic not happened and that private investments were beginning to unfold. He said India‚Äôs growth prospects are bright.

‚ÄúGovernment investment in infrastructure in the last several years is beginning to crowd in private sector investment as can be seen in new project announcements and also from data released by companies about their cash flow projections,"" Nageswaran said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet that the figures underscore the resilience of the Indian economy amid global challenges. ‚ÄúThis robust performance, along with overall optimism and compelling macroeconomic indicators, exemplify the promising trajectory of our economy and the tenacity of our people,"" Modi said.

An official statement from the finance ministry said enabled by the release of pent-up demand, real private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) surpassed the pre-pandemic trend trajectory. Also, a large step-up in public sector capex over the last three years has contributed to the gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), surpassing the pre-pandemic trend trajectory.

However, experts flagged private consumption as a weak point. Rating agency Ind-Ra said in an analysis that with inflation easing, it expected private consumption growth to acquire momentum, but the current consumption demand is highly skewed in favour of goods and services consumed largely by households falling in the upper-income bracket. A broad-based consumption recovery, therefore, is still some distance away, it said.

Some economists stated that GDP growth could moderate to 6.1% in FY24 due to several factors, including slowing domestic discretionary demand, subdued external demand and financial uncertainties.

‚ÄúOverall, the share of private consumption in GDP could witness a marginal fall. Investment demand is expected to remain robust. However, global growth slowdown and financial uncertainties could weigh on business optimism,"" said Rajani Sinha, chief economist, CareEdge.

Sinha added that rising rural wages, record foodgrain production and the expectation of lower food inflation bode well for the rural demand outlook. However, the development of El-Nino conditions during the monsoon season is a key risk for agriculture production and rural income. Experts further pointed out that inflation is expected to moderate in FY24 relative to FY23, which is a positive for household budgets and consumption.

This growth was primarily driven by the services sector and increased consumption, positioning India as one of the top-performing major economies in the world.

However, in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year (January to March), the Indian economy grew at a slightly lower rate of 6.1 per cent compared to the corresponding period in the previous year, as indicated by data from the National Statistical Office.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has implemented a series of interest rate hikes, totalling 250 basis points (bps), since May of the previous year. Economists anticipate that the RBI will maintain the benchmark repo rate at its current level for the remainder of 2023, as it monitors the effects of the previous rate increases before making any further adjustments.

Economists, however, warned that the global slowdown and volatility in financial markets pose a risk to exports and the growth outlook in coming quarters. Here are the economists' responses to the recently released GDP data:

""The growth outlook is (not) without risks - particularly in regards to the monsoon progress and recession risks globally,"" said Sakshi Gupta, an economist at HDFC Bank.

Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist at rating agency Icra, said, ‚ÄúGDP expansion in Q4 FY2023 was appreciably higher than expected while remaining uneven and confirming the hopes of a sequential pickup in the pace of growth of economic activity to 6.1 per cent from the bottom of 4.5 per cent seen in Q3 FY2023.""

Icra has projected growth of real GDP in FY24 at 6 per cent, with a downside risk of up to 50 basis points in the event that an El Nino affects the monsoon rains.

Economists say more and more job-seekers, especially the young, are looking for low-paid casual work or falling back on unreliable self-employment, even though the broader Indian economy is seen growing at a world-beating 6.5% in the financial year ending in March 2024.

Daniel Leigh, who heads the World Economic Studies division in the IMF's Research Department, in April called the country ""one of the bright spots in the global economy"".

State Bank of India Chief Economic Adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh added in a note on Friday that the manufacturing sector was expected to rebound, while the boost in government spending would ""strengthen job creation and demand"".

The unemployment rate, which has been rising this year and reached 8.11 per cent in April according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, could weigh on the economy.

Taking to Twitter, PM Modi said, ‚ÄúThe 2022-23 GDP growth figures underscore the resilience of the Indian economy amidst global challenges. This robust performance along with overall optimism and compelling macro-economic indicators, exemplify the promising trajectory of our economy and the tenacity of our people.""

""So, we are very pleased to have been able to present a story of sustained economic momentum combined with macroeconomic, financial and fiscal stability, and we look forward to another year of solid economic performance by India,"" he said while briefing the media.

India's economy grew by 6.1 per cent in the January-March quarter of 2022-23, pushing the annual growth rate to 7.2 per cent on account of better performance by agriculture, manufacturing, mining and construction sectors.

In FY23, 7.2% economic growth is predicted for India. India's exceptional growth rates of 7.2% in FY23 and 6.1% in Q4 show that its economic narrative continues to emerge. Meanwhile, the growth of the eight core industries in April was 3.5% instead of 3.6% (MoM) and 10.4% (YoY). Here are the market analyst's reactions to GDP data.

Forecasts for normal monsoon season rains in the next four months could support the farm sector, which grew 5.5% year-on-year in the March quarter compared with an upwardly revised 4.7% in the previous quarter.

Data from the NSO revealed that India's per capital national income (net) rises to ‚Çπ98,374 crore in FY23, as against ‚Çπ92,583 crore in FY22.

Pankaj Pandey, head of Research at ICICI Securities

ICICI SECURITIES More Information

Banking remains one of the most significant indicators of overall economic growth, and GDP figures are rising. I believe banking will reflect the overall economic buoyancy, and we have already seen this segment do well in terms of credit growth being in the mid teens, as well as the sector delivering one of the strongest profitability with most of the major indicators in favour. And with the kind of push the government is giving to capital expenditures (capex). As a result, banking remains one of the best sectors for overall economic buoyancy.

All of this will be reflected by the banking industry. As of now, we are seeing that the manufacturing sector is benefiting mostly from lower input prices ranging from oil to a variety of base metals. And I believe that China has not yet recovered as projected, and that government spending on Capex has been at an all-time high. It will all have a favourable impact on many sectors, but if someone has to pick one, it should be banking. Also, while earnings growth is strong and volatility is at an all-time high, values are nowhere near peak levels. However, the multiples are not at their highest.

Siddharth Bhotika, fund manager at ITI Long Short Equity Fund

According to Siddharth Bhotika, fund manager at ITI Long Short Equity Fund, markets are forward looking so older data points do not move markets as such. Future trajectory of growth and inflation and change in expectations of these would result in market adjustments.

Banks, capital goods are still doing great in terms of earnings, near to medium term view also sanguine. On the other hand, there are still clouds on pharma and information technology (IT) space.

IRB Infrastructure ‚Äì IRB is a leader in BOT/HAM based road projects the company is likely to benefit from a healthy growth in the GDP numbers. Road infrastructure has been a mainstay of the government and with the increasing budgetary allocation towards infrastructure, we are expecting strong project allocation to IRB in the coming years.

Larsen & Toubro ‚Äì Improving city infrastructure and picking up in the capex cycle is likely to benefit L&T‚Äôs EPC business, while Atmanirbhar Bharat drive is likely to improve sourcing of heavy engineering and defence products to enhance revenues in other segments of the company.

Gail India ‚Äì Aggressive rollout of CGD across India has significantly improved the demand for natural gas transmission pipeline network. Majority of this onus is on Gail India and hence the next 7-8 years will be revenue accretive for the company.

Indian Oil Corp ‚Äì Rising demand for refined products from India to developed countries is likely to benefit Indian refineries, and being the largest PSU refinery company, IOCL will get the benefit.

NTPC ‚Äì The company has been improving its renewable energy business over the past couple of years, which could improve its business diversification in the coming years.

Avinash Gorakshakar, Head-Research at Profitmart Securities

Most economy related stocks like auto cement capital goods building products banking real estate and housing are sectors which will benefit from macro tailwinds in the economy.

Hence stocks like Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, DLF Ltd, Cummins, HDFC, HDFC Bank, Ambuja Cements, and Kajaria should do well ahead.

The Indian economy exhibited robust resilience in 2022-23 amidst a global turmoil following the war in Ukraine, and recorded a growth of 7%, the highest among major economies in the world.

The recovery in the domestic economy gained momentum during the second quarter of 2022-23 as domestic supply chains normalised and activity in contact-intensive sectors rebounded, the central bank noted.

‚ÄúRobust balance sheets of the corporate sector and banks enabled a rebound in credit demand, which was also facilitated by a large increase in capex by the centre. With real GDP growing by an estimated 7 per cent, the Indian economy turned out to be one of the fastest growing major economies of the world during 2022-23,"" RBI said.

Global Economy

RBI believes the prospects for the global economy continue to be shadowed by high inflation, the adverse effects of geo-economic fragmentation operating through restrictions on movements of trade, labour, capital and diffusion of technology, and potential amplification of financial sector vulnerabilities.

Medium- to long term challenges such as climate change, cyber security, crypto currencies, FinTech and tech disruptions can also potentially vitiate the outlook, it said.

Indian Economy

Several shocks tested the resilience of the Indian economy in 2022-23. On the back of sound macroeconomic policies, softer commodity prices, a robust financial sector, a healthy corporate sector, continued fiscal policy thrust on quality of government expenditure, and new growth opportunities stemming from global realignment of supply chains, India‚Äôs growth momentum is likely to be sustained in 2023-24 in an atmosphere of easing inflationary pressures.

In the external sector, RBI expects the current account deficit (CAD) to remain moderate, drawing strength from robust services exports and the salubrious impact of moderation in commodity prices of imports.

With global uncertainties persisting, it expects foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows may remain volatile, but the favourable domestic growth outlook, lower inflation, and business friendly policy reforms could, however, help sustain buoyant FDI inflows.

Inflation

During 2022-23, headline inflation averaged 6.7%, 115 bps higher than a year ago.

Timely beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle with a cumulative increase in the policy repo rate by 250 bps since May 2022 helped ease demand pressures, anchor inflation expectations and contain the second-round impact of successive supply shocks, RBI highlighted.

Consumption & Demand

Meanwhile, indicators of consumption demand suggest a broad-based revival in 2022-23.

The rural demand, which was deeply scathed by the second wave of COVID-19 a year ago recovered, albeit at a slower pace, vis-√†-vis urban demand.

Real rural wage growth virtually stagnated in 2022-23 despite a visible uptick in economic activity. Although job demand under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) declined on a y-o-y basis, it still prevailed above the pre-pandemic level in 2022-23, RBI said.

This indicates that the recovery, especially in the unorganised segment of the economy is not yet complete.

Currency Notes in Circulation

On the currency notes in circulation, the central bank report said that the value and volume of banknotes in circulation increased by 7.8% and 4.4%, respectively, during 2022-23.

In value terms, the share of ‚Çπ500 and ‚Çπ2000 banknotes together accounted for 87.9% of the total value of banknotes in circulation as on March 31, 2023, as compared to 87.1% as on March 31, 2022.

In volume terms, ‚Çπ500 denomination constituted the highest share at 37.9%, followed by ‚Çπ10 denomination banknotes which constituted 19.2% of the total banknotes in circulation as on March 31, 2023.

Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)

The Reserve Bank introduced its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in phases during the year, with the launch of pilots for Digital Rupee (e-Rupee) in the wholesale and retail segments on November 1, 2022 and December 1, 2022, respectively.

The value of e-Rupee-Wholesale and e-Rupee-Retail in circulation stood at ‚Çπ10.69 crore and ‚Çπ5.70 crore, respectively, as on March 31, 2023.

During 2023-24, the Reserve Bank aims at expanding the ongoing pilots in CBDC-Retail and CBDC-Wholesale by incorporating various use cases and features. The pilot in CBDC-Retail is proposed to be expanded to more locations and to include more participating banks, RBI said.

247,mint,World's fourth largest economy enters recession. Is a crash coming soon?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/worlds-fourth-largest-economy-enters-recession-is-a-crash-coming-soon-11685424405386.html,30 May 2023,,"A chart that has gone viral recently on social media is the probability of recession across major economies.

And proud Indians aren't tired of flashing it to their fellow citizens as well as the rest of the world. This chart says India has a zero percent chance of a recession in 2023.

In other words, India is the only major economy in the world that won't face a recession in 2023.

Guess what, something happened last week to make you trust this chart even more. This chart had given Germany a 60% chance of a recession in 2023.

Well, the people behind the chart have reason to rejoice. They said Germany, Europe's largest and the world's fourth largest economy, had a strong possibility of recession this year.

Well, Germany has officially entered a recession.

Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) fell 0.3% for the March quarter. This follows a 0.5% contraction in the last 3 months of 2022. Two consecutive quarters of contraction is what commonly defines a recession. Germany has crossed this threshold.

Higher energy price is one of the key reasons behind Germany's economic struggles. Although a mild winter and easing supply chain problems did help, they could not prevent a recession.

Now, Germany has set off alarm bells across the rest of the world. Everyone's thinking about the next domino that could topple and add to the woes.

More importantly, people are worried whether this could crash the stock markets.

To be honest, no one knows for sure.

If historical evidence is anything to go by, I don't think investors need to worry too much about recessions. Stock markets have managed themselves quite well in the face of economic contractions.

A piece on the Fidelity website provides some nice information.

It says that the S&P 500 i.e. the US benchmark index, went up by 1% on an average during all recession periods since 1945. So, the stock market actually went up on average during periods of economic contraction.

Isn't this illogical and counterintuitive? If the economy goes down, stock markets should also go down, simple.

Well, the stock markets do follow the economy. But they happen to be a leading indicator. Put differently, they top out before the start of the recession. And they also bottom out before the recession ends.

This leads to a situation where stock markets give positive returns even during a recession.

Of course, this is not always true. As per the same Fidelity piece, there have also been occasions where the stock market has gone down during a recession.

In fact, during the last four recessions since 1990, the S&P 500 has declined 8.8% on average. This is certainly a performance worse than the pre-1990 period.

However, it's not something that will keep you up at night. An 8.8% crash is pretty much par for the course in the stock market.

Yes, it's true that I'm talking averages here. And there have been recessions where the US stock market has declined more than 8.8%.

During the 2008 crash, the US economy was in recession between December 2007 and June 2009. The US stock market went down a huge 36% during that period. So, the stock market did crash significantly during this recession.

Another big decline was the recession between November 1973 and March 1975. Here, the markets corrected by close to 20% (Source: Invesco).

Therefore, it's possible that the upcoming recession in the US and other parts of the world may lead to a big stock market crash.

However, there's also a possibility that it may not. Hence, as an individual investor, it may get really confusing as to what would be the right strategy to follow.

Should one move out of stocks and get into the safety of bonds and fixed deposits, or should one stay put and not do anything, even if there's a risk of our portfolio getting cut in half?

To be honest, such analysis isn't very meaningful for an Indian investor.

There is very little chance the Indian economy could enters the recessionary danger zone in 2023. Yes, our growth may slow down. However, it looks unlikely that our economy contracts in 2023.

Having said that, our stock market isn't likely to stay insulated from the developments across the world, especially the US stock market. And if the latter were to cave in, there will be tremors felt here as well.

We believe the best option during such times is to maintain a long term perspective.

You see, the long term India growth story is still intact and fundamentally strong Indian companies would certainly be creating new profit records 10 years from now.

Therefore, the idea should be to stay invested in such stocks even if they are likely to go down in the near term. Any significant correction in their stock prices shouldn't lead to panic and anxiety. Instead, should be seen as an opportunity to buy more of their shares.

Yes, you should be wary of investing in stocks in weak competitive positions and having weak fundamentals. But you don't have to worry about companies with strong fundamentals.

Market corrections and crashes are big opportunities to enter such stocks at valuations that tilt the risk-reward equation firmly in your favour, from a long-term perspective.

And you should grab such opportunities with both hands whenever they are presented to you. After all, it's during such times that the biggest fortunes are made in the stock market.

So, be greedy when others are turning fearful and put yourself in the driver's seat of the long-term India growth story.

Happy Investing.

Growth is, however, expected to stay uneven across sectors.

GDP data for the fiscal fourth quarter is slated to be released on 31 May.

Economists‚Äô estimates ranging between 4.4% and 5.4% places March quarter growth higher than the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs projection of 4.2%. The median projection suggests the full-year growth could be 7.0%, higher than the central bank‚Äôs 6.8% forecast.

‚ÄúEconomic activity in January-March remained uneven, with the domestic demand for services outpacing that for goods, and, surprisingly, robust exports of services amidst a contraction in merchandise items,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at Icra Ltd in a 24 May report.

‚ÄúLower commodity prices offered relief for margins in some sectors, while trends in investment activity and government spending were mixed,"" she added.

Several organizations lowered India‚Äôs growth projection from their initial forecasts following disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, which led to slower global growth and tighter monetary policy worldwide.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank expect the Indian economy to have grown at 6.8% and 6.9%, respectively, in 2022-23.

Despite the tough global backdrop, the Indian economy seems to be growing steadily, with the central bank having raised its GDP growth projection for FY24 to 6.5% in April from 6.4% in February.

Nevertheless, with inflation having eased further, the RBI will likely go on a long pause to support growth. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is scheduled to meet 6-8 June.

‚ÄúWe expect the RBI to stay on an extended pause, given CPI inflation is still way above the target 4%, and there are upside risks on the horizon from monsoon and oil price trajectory. Unless growth slows materially, the RBI is unlikely to embark on a rate cutting cycle,"" Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ Research said."

Here's why",https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-should-reduce-direct-tax-from-40-to-25-suggests-economist-surjit-bhalla-heres-why-11685285046236.html,28 May 2023,,"India has registered the highest tax collections despite not being in the league of richest countries of the world. Eminent economist Surjit Bhalla has cited this to note that Indian government should reduce direct from to 25% from the current 40%.

Bhalla told news agency PTI, that the reduction in Direct Tax from 40% to 25% is required to facilitate economic growth in India.

""We are a much more globalised economy in the world and the world is a lot more globalised. If you look at the overall tax rate structure in India, collection of taxes is one of the highest in the world and we are not the richest economy of the world,"" Bhalla said.

He said that tax collection by state, Centre and local bodies is around 19 per cent of India's GDP.

""We should move towards reducing it by 2 percentage points. As far as direct taxes are concerned, I think the overall tax rate should not be more than 25 per cent. Right now it is close to 40 with surcharges etc. 25 per cent, which is our corporate tax rate, that's what our income tax rate should be,"" Bhalla said.

Currently, the highest income tax rate in India stands at 39 per cent. The Budget 2023-24 had lowered India's highest rate of income tax from 42.74 per cent, by reducing the surcharge applicable on high net-worth individuals.

Bhalla said that taxes need to come down for all and not just benefit a select section of the society.

India's gross direct tax collection during the last fiscal ended March 2023 grew over 20 per cent to ‚Çπ19.68 lakh crore.

This includes gross corporate tax collection growth of 16.91 per cent at over ‚Çπ10.04 lakh crore. Gross personal I-T collection jumped 24.23 per cent to over ‚Çπ9.60 lakh crore.

Bhalla said direct tax is one of the areas where there is a lot of bureaucratic involvement and it should be a lot more streamlined to minimise tax evasion.

""You cannot minimise tax evasion without doing something about very very high rates of income taxation. We need to change the tax structure so that everyone benefits rather than some selected sectors,"" he said.

251,mint,Goldman Sachs hikes India‚Äôs 2023 GDP forecast to 6.3%,https://www.livemint.com/economy/goldman-sachs-hikes-india-s-2023-gdp-forecast-to-63-11685119844718.html,26 May 2023,,"New Delhi: Goldman Sachs on Friday raised India‚Äôs GDP growth forecast for calendar year 2023 by 30 basis points to 6.3%, citing a rise in exports. The earlier forecast was made in November, which showed that Indian economy will grow at 5.9%.

‚ÄúThere are pockets of strength in services demand ‚Äî Services PMI clocked a 13-year high of 62.0, domestic air passenger traffic exceeded pre-pandemic levels and services exports have held up despite a slowdown in global growth,"" said Santanu Sengupta, India economist at Goldman Sachs.

Private sector investment demand has been muted in recent months. But, sequential growth in government expenditure is expected to come in stronger than earlier expected, given spending trends in January and February, said Sengupta.

Goldman Sachs has pegged GDP growth for the Jan-March 2023 quarter at 4.9%, 6.5% for April-June, 5.9% for July-September and 8.1% for October-December.

Goldman Sachs expects a strong trend in services exports, while the trend of lower merchandise imports is likely to continue, leading to a net export boost in 2023.

Real exports may grow above 4% year-on-year, while flat real import growth may be seen in 2023, it said.

However, Goldman Sachs lowered the country‚Äôs investment growth forecast to 7.9% year-on-year in the calendar year 2023, compared to 9% year-on-year earlier.

The central government is currently leading most of the capex push for the economy, while private sector investment remains tepid, it said.

Goldman Sachs expects a pick-up in government expenditure in the second half of fiscal 2023‚Äì2024 before the general elections in 2024.

Goldman Sachs stressed the ‚Äúpockets of strength"" in service demand, as the services PMI clocked a 13-year high of 62, domestic air passenger traffic exceeded pre-pandemic levels, and service exports held up despite a slowdown in global growth.

But the demand for private sector investment, the brokerage said, has remained muted, as seen by a slowdown in industrial credit growth, led by large industries, in recent months.

In contrast, the Reserve Bank of India has projected GDP growth at 7.8% in April-June, 6.2% in July-September, 6.1% in October-December and 5.9% in Jan-March of 2024, taking the overall GDP growth in 2023-24 to 6.5%.

The National Statistical Organisation (NSO) is scheduled to release the provisional estimate for the GDP growth for the fourth quarter as well for the fiscal 2022-23 on May 31.

Icra estimates the services gross value added (GVA) year-on-year growth to have risen mildly to about 6.4% in Q4 FY23 from 6.2% in Q3 FY23.

The last nine years of the Narendra Modi government have seen equity benchmarks the Sensex and the Nifty surging by 150 per cent while the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms more than tripled, or jumped by ‚Çπ195 lakh crore, in that period.

Sensex was at the level of 24,716.88 and Nifty50 was at 7,359.05 on 26 May 2014 when Modi became the Prime Minister of India for the first time. Sensex is now near the 62,000 mark while Nifty is eyeing the 19,000 level. The cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms stood at ‚Çπ85,20,816.63 crore on May 26, 2014; on May 25, 2023, the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms was ‚Çπ2,80,33,373.63 crore.

Among the sectoral indices, the Nifty IT index surged 219 per cent while the Nifty Financial Services index surged 213 per cent in that period.

The Nifty Private Bank index jumped 196 per cent, the Nifty Bank index jumped 188 per cent and the Nifty FMCG index jumped 180 per cent in the Modi government's nine-year regime.

Nifty Energy index (up 140 per cent), Nifty Auto index (up 116 per cent), Nifty Realty index (up 94 per cent), Nifty Metal index (up 86 per cent) and Nifty Pharma index (up 67 per cent) rose in that order during the period.

The period of the Modi government saw India's economy growing on average at a strong pace of about 6-7 per cent every year. Morgan Stanley believes India is ""on track to become the world‚Äôs third-largest economy by 2027, surpassing Japan and Germany, and have the third-largest stock market by 2030 due to global trends and key investments the country has made in technology and energy.""

Moreover, India‚Äôs GDP could more than double from $3.5 trillion today to surpass $7.5 trillion by 2031, Morgan Stanley says.

Analysts point out that the Modi government's policies such as Make In India, performance-linked incentive (PLI), focus on foreign direct investment, etc., have been the major triggers that have given a boost to the Indian market and economy.

Modi's regime so far has been marked by a major thrust on infrastructure projects, pro-business reforms, financial inclusion and financial reforms. All this, along with political stability, has been positive for the market. Many analysts say that the market's perception of Modi is pro-business

Many top analysts highlight that the brand Modi has a strong influence on the stock market.

In his latest 'Greed and Fear' report, Jefferies' Christopher Wood underscored one obvious worry for the market over the next 12 months will be the inevitable questioning of the current consensus, namely that Modi will be re-elected.

After this, another potential risk is a further reduction in retail investor activity following a period when the stock market has traded in a tight range. Wood pointed out that the active brokerage accounts have declined from a peak of 38 million in June 2022 to 31 million in April 2023.

Wood, who is the global head of equities at Jefferies, believes that it is only a matter of time before Sensex reaches 100,000 level. He further added that the Indian stock market will continue to climb the proverbial wall of worry.

""This target, on a five-year view, now assumes a trend of 15 per cent EPS (earnings per share) growth and that a five-year average one-year forward PE (price-to-earnings) multiple of 19.8 times is maintained,"" said Wood.

The growth is higher than 4.4% recorded in the preceding quarter.

The country‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the entire financial year 2022-2023 is likely to be higher than first advance estimate of 7% by NSO.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has estimated Q4FY23 real GDP growth at 5.1%. For 2023-24, RBI projects GDP growth at 6.5% with Q1 pegged at 7.6%.

This growth can be attributed to several factors, including the strong prospects for agricultural and related activities, which is expected to positively impact domestic consumption and investment. Additionally, strengthening business and consumer confidence, as well as robust credit expansion, are likely to contribute to the overall economic expansion.

Notably, domestic GDP growth comes amidst a backdrop of global economic downturn, characterized by recessionary pressures in several countries. These challenges arise from a combination of geopolitical tensions, climate-related shocks, increased debt servicing obligations due to rising interest rates, money and currency market upheavals, among others.

‚ÄúAmidst this global hullabaloo, India is expected to continue its showdown in pursuing a different pathway of zeroing in on drivers of growth, looking for a renewed surge in resilient manufacturing while supporting services sector to embrace enhanced efficiency,"" Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, State Bank of India said in a report.

Ghosh projects India‚Äôs Q4 GDP growth at 5.5% and that for FY23 to be likely at 7.1%.

Meanwhile, India Inc. continues to front lead the economic turnaround while embracing better operational and financial efficiency. In Q4FY23, around 1700 listed entities reported top line growth of 12%, while net profit grew by around 19% as compared to the same period previous year.

Green shoots are also emerging on foreign capital inflows in capital markets with foreign institutional investors (FII) YTD inflows in FY24 touching $6 billion, a reversal of trend from 2022.

However, start-ups financing has been hit due to banking turmoil in the US, in particular failure of niche banks though it also offers a gearing up pedestal to domestic financial institutions to ring fence the financial needs of these changelings internally to ensure the sweet spot enjoyed by India grows in a disruptive and disproportionate manner, the SBI report noted.

Madhavi Arora, Lead Economist at Emkay Global Financial Services sees Q4 GDP growth at 5.1% and FY23 growth at 7%. She expects growth to slow to 5.7% in FY24.

‚ÄúGrowth in Q4 is expected to be driven by momentum in trade, hotel and transportation while government spending may have also picked up. There are nascent signs of consumption recovery, however it is still led by urban more than rural. Besides, net exports were less of a drag to growth amid lower trade deficit and higher services net exports,"" Arora said.

In the third quarter of 2022-23, India's economic growth slowed down to 4.4% amid a series of interest rate hikes by the central bank that hurt demand, while weakness in the manufacturing sector continued.

Care Ratings projects GDP growth in FY23 at 6.8% with economic growth in Q4 projected at 4.4%.

‚ÄúGrowth is expected to be led by the services sector while net exports and the manufacturing sector are expected to weigh on growth. Economic growth is projected to moderate to 6.1% in FY24 amid global economic uncertainties and likely spillovers from the external sector,"" Care Ratings said.

The Union Budget 2023-24‚Äôs emphasis on capital expenditure is expected to crowd-in private investment, strengthen job creation and demand, and raise growth potential, analysts said.

254,mint,A decade of reformist action has catalysed the emergence of India,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/a-decade-of-reformist-action-has-catalysed-the-emergence-of-india-11685040801467.html,26 May 2023,,"The ninth anniversary of India‚Äôs present government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an opportune moment to assess its achievements so far, especially as the next 25 years lead up to the 100th anniversary of India‚Äôs independence. The experience would also serve as a guidepost for the government to script a blueprint and draw a policy road map for India‚Äôs future, an exercise that would help establish India as a global force to reckon with as it aims to become a developed economy by 2047.

The present government has been working towards changing perceptions about India ever since it assumed office. Since its decisive mandate of 2014, the Modi government has worked assiduously to create a strong India, ready to take on the world on the strength of its robust fundamentals. Hence, even as the global economy faces headwinds, India today continues to hold its own, having emerged as the world‚Äôs fastest growing major economy for three consecutive years.

Further, India‚Äôs G20 Presidency this year provides an opportunity to showcase Indian leadership in tackling various challenges, including those of reviving global growth, undertaking climate action, social empowerment and healthcare, among others. The global spotlight on India has essentially been enabled by the many bold and extraordinary steps taken by the government to ensure that the country gets its rightful place at the global high table.

Indeed, the government as over the last nine years brought in multi-dimensional reforms and taken many initiatives, in partnership with major stakeholders, in diverse areas to create the right enablers to bolster competitiveness, promote inclusion and propel growth. The impetus given by the government to ramp up public investment in infrastructure, encourage manufacturing, promote investor-friendly policies, support SMEs, among others, will go a long way to make India competitive in the global economy. The credo of development through good governance, with a focus on execution, has struck the right chord and its results have been fruitful.

Further, the work done by the government in the direction of fiscal consolidation, better subsidy targeting, uplifting agriculture, financial inclusion and effecting social transformation would help enhance efficiency and take the country onto a path of inclusive and sustainable growth.

From the perspective of Indian industry, seven high points of the government‚Äôs economic strategy deserve special mention.

First, the government‚Äôs relentless drive to revitalize infrastructure by taking steps to improve last-mile connectivity, reducing logistics costs, expanding roads and rail network, ports and airports, etc, is noteworthy. The creation of a National Infrastructure Pipeline, the 33% capex hike in the Budget for 2023-24 and the Gati Shakti scheme are among the Centre‚Äôs most recent initiatives to strengthen infrastructure, boost market competitiveness and fortify growth. Similarly, the asset monetization programme and NaBFID would greatly help to unlock capital for infrastructure financing.

Second, through its Atmanirbhar Bharat programme of self-reliance and production linked incentive scheme, the government is spearheading a manufacturing transformation. Also, its accent on improving the ease of doing business and facilitating corporate exits, plus its introduction of GST and reduction in corporate tax, together with skill development, FDI reforms, etc, will go a long way to make India a hub of manufacturing and exports.

Third, India has among the world‚Äôs most open foreign investment regimes, having opened sectors such as retail, civil aviation, defence equipment, space, insurance, nuclear energy and others to international players in a big way. Hence, India is emerging as a preferred FDI destination as global businesses seek to de-risk their operations. India has also signed economic cooperation and trade agreements with countries such as the UAE and Australia, and negotiations are underway with the UK, EU and Canada, among others, to expand global ties.

Fourth, the government‚Äôs pioneering Start-Up India initiative, among the most aspirational schemes, has catalysed a startup culture and built a strong and inclusive ecosystem for entrepreneurship in the country. Today, India has the world‚Äôs third-largest startup ecosystem, with registered startups crossing the milestone of 100,000.

Fifth, the Prime Minister has conceived of digitization, technology and innovation as the centrepiece of a grand vision to foster the emergence of a digitally empowered society and knowledge-based economy, with the Digital India initiative having vaulted our prospects in this realm.

Sixth, the government‚Äôs focus on sustainability and green growth is now a key part of its overall developmental strategy. India is among the first few countries to have walked the talk on its climate commitments and has set an ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. Besides, India is the third largest producer of renewable energy, with the potential to emerge as the global hub for green hydrogen.

Seventh, the administration‚Äôs deep commitment to social empowerment has seen schemes such as Jan Dhan Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, Kisan Samman Nidhi, Ayushman Bharat Yojana, Gareeb Kalyan Yojana, Swachh Bharat Yojana, Awas Yojana, Jal Jivan Mission, etc, all of which are exemplary initiatives for the uplift of the needy. Besides, the government drew accolades for its bulk vaccine production and global outreach in the midst of the covid pandemic.

However, the country‚Äôs expanding aspirations call for more such actions. Infrastructure development must continue to get priority, even as we make a consistent improvement in the ease of doing business, reduce the cost of doing business through factor market reforms, lower the costs of energy and capital and focus resources on health, education and skills, among others.

India is at a tipping point in history. With our broad focus on growth while assuring citizens a commensurate improvement in the quality of their lives, we can look forward to a bright future.

When the summer arrives, Indians seek relief in popular packaged summer drinks. However, many well-known drinks have sugar levels that could exceed our full-day limit with just a single pack, a Mint analysis showed. Indians already have a deep-seated love for sugar, and the average intake in cities such as Mumbai and Ahmedabad exceeds the healthy limit. The average intake is 18.7 grams and 20.2 grams per day among men and women respectively, a government survey showed.

Softening Prices

Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year caused a surge in input prices for businesses, straining their finances. Companies passed on these costs to consumers, which dampened demand across products such as edible oils, cookies, and soaps. However, certain commodities are now cooling significantly. Several businesses are refraining from raising prices, and some are even cutting them, providing consumers some relief from high inflation, Mint reported.

India's IT companies are likely to cut campus hiring by at least 40% due to strong bench strength, fewer new orders, and a lack of visibility into when the slowdown phase will end, an analysis by recruiter TeamLease Digital said. IT firms are likely to hire 155,000 students in FY24, down from the 230,000 recruited in the previous year and 600,000 in FY22. Recruiters studying talent demand and supply have warned that it is critical to continue hiring from campuses to gain cost leverage.

A government panel recently recommended a ban on diesel-run four-wheelers by 2027 in large urban centres. The Centre‚Äôs Vahan database shows that the share of diesel cars was already declining. Nearly half of all cars registered in India were diesel-run a decade ago. But the trend began reversing in favour of petrol cars after diesel prices became market-linked in 2014. As of May 2023, the share of diesel vehicles has come down to 18%, and that of petrol vehicles has increased to 61%.

The Bloomberg estimates indicated that the data, set for release next week, will show the economy expanded 7 per cent in the previous financial year. On the other hand, higher borrowing costs could have slowed some activity in the country. Despite these retarding factors, India continued to remain the world's fasted-growing major economy. With this pace of economic growth, India outpaced China and drew heavy foreign inflows in the equity markets.

With this, he indicated that other than monsoon and geo-political risks, the Indian economy will be on a ‚Äústeady auto-pilot"" and ‚Äúticks all the right boxes at this point.""

According to the data compiled by Bloomberg, factors like higher tax collections and booming services sectors helped India maintain its momentum. In contrast to higher tax collection, there was a decline in exports and imports, which can be a concern for the economy.

Nageswaran is hopeful that the data will show a positive outlook for the Indian economy. He also justified the fall in export and imports. He said the goods exports are falling due to a slump in global demand, whereas, the decline in imports is the result of lower crude oil prices.

The stable current account deficit and rising foreign exchange reserves are also going positive signs.

Inflation has slowed to an 18-month low of 4.7 per cent, but a hot summer, which could affect crops, is still a concern. Other inflation risks are volatile global commodity prices as India is a major importer of crude and edible oils. However, Nageswaran is confident that India can overcome inflation provided a fall in crude oil prices.

257,mint,El Ni√±o has cast a long shadow on the Indian economy,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/el-ni-o-risk-looms-over-india-s-agriculture-and-economy-impact-on-rural-demand-inflation-and-monsoon-uncertain-11684951899908.html,25 May 2023,,"The probability of El Ni√±o developing has risen sharply. This has led to fears of its impact on India‚Äôs agriculture sector, rural demand and inflation. Unfortunately, this risk has emerged at a time when there are already other risks lurking for the Indian economy like weak external demand, skewed domestic demand and tight monetary conditions. In the midst of all this, a weather-led disruption could have adverse repercussions on the economy.

The probability of El Ni√±o developing this year is about 90%, as per a US-based agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But does this necessarily imply that India‚Äôs monsoon will be adversely impacted? While the Indian Meteorological Department has forecast normal rains, private forecaster Skymet has projected a below-normal monsoon this year. Going by our experience, of the 21 El Ni√±o years we‚Äôve had since 1950, there was below normal or deficient monsoon rains in 11. In the past, there has been normal rainfall even in El Ni√±o years if the event‚Äôs intensity was weak or if its arrival did not clash with our monsoon. In some years, the impact of El Ni√±o has been countered by a positive IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole-another weather-related development that results in high rainfall). For instance, despite 1994, 1997 and 2006 being El Ni√±o years, India received normal/excess rainfall as IOD was significantly positive. For 2023, there are forecasts of IOD moving into the positive territory, which may counter El Ni√±o‚Äôs impact. Analysis of past data shows that the likelihood of poor rainfall is nearly 70% in case of a strong or moderate El Ni√±o event.

As these are all weather-related predictions, it is difficult to get a very clear picture. But the important point to analyse is what happens in case there is a poor monsoon in India this year. Approximately half of the country‚Äôs net sown area relies on the monsoon rains, which also replenish water reservoirs. While the overall impact on the agriculture sector will depend on the spatial distribution and timing of rainfall, there is still a risk of farm production being adversely impacted in case of below-normal monsoon. Foodgrain production for agriculture year 2022-23 (July-June) is estimated at a record high of 323.6 million tonnes, 2.5% higher compared to previous year. However, rice production this year has already got adversely impacted (2.6% lower compared to previous year) due to a rainfall deficit in key producing states and unseasonal rainfall. Even though the production of wheat is estimated to be 4% higher as per the second advance estimate, the final output could be negatively impacted by heatwaves during March-May. Wheat production had fallen by around 2% in agriculture year 2021-22 due to heat waves.

Note that agriculture contributes around 18% to India‚Äôs GVA (gross value added). Moreover, there is an indirect impact on the economy in the form of consumption demand, as agriculture employs around 47% of India‚Äôs workforce. Hence, weak rural demand can adversely impact other sectors like FMCGs, automobiles, cement, paint, etc. Unfortunately, rural demand has anyway been relatively weak over the past year. High retail inflation coupled with high input prices for the agriculture sector and weak rural wage growth have kept rural demand subdued. In the last two quarters, as some of these parameters improved, rural demand began showing signs of an upturn, as indicated by FMCG companies‚Äô sales. However, weather related disruption and below-normal rains could derail the recovery in rural sector demand. While the reliance of our rural economy on the agriculture sector has been reducing (agriculture‚Äôs share in rural income fell to 40% in 2011-12 from 51% in 1999-00), it is still high. Also, any adverse impact on the farm sector would further exacerbate India‚Äôs skewed economic recovery.

The other big factor is the impact of poor monsoon on inflation. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation in the last two months has moderated below 6% (RBI‚Äôs upper limit). However, inflation for some essential food items such as cereals and milk remains high (13.7% and 8.8%, respectively in April). Household inflationary expectations that are strongly influenced by food inflation, remain at a high of 10.5% (one-year ahead expectations). In the recent past, the government has intervened to control food inflation through measures like open-market sales of wheat, reducing import duty on edible oil, curbing rice exports and banning wheat exports. Hence, the government may continue to intervene to control food prices in case of a poor monsoon. As per an International Monetary Fund study, El Ni√±o can significantly impact global commodity prices, which in turn will have implications for our inflation and monetary policy response. While the Reserve Bank of India has paused its rate hikes, it has indicated a need to be watchful on inflation front. With wholesale inflation having fallen sharply in the last two months, there are expectations of a CPI reprieve too. However, weather-related disruption continues to pose price risks.

It is difficult to make predications on the economy based on the likelihood of a global phenomenon like El Ni√±o. However, the government needs to be cautious and ready with a plan in case this event materializes. India is already struggling with slowing external demand and waning pent-up domestic demand. Any weather-related disruption to the agricultural sector and rural demand would skew the recovery further and pose economic difficulties.

258,mint,Competitive populism could hurt the Indian economy,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/populism-rural-voters-and-the-economy-the-challenges-facing-india-s-political-parties-ahead-of-2024-lok-sabha-elections-11684863146205.html,23 May 2023,,"The economy did not play a big role in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) forming a government in Karnataka, but may have in its defeat. High levels of corruption and inflation and shifting preferences of rural voters were among the reasons listed by political analysts to explain the Karnataka state assembly poll results.

The BJP‚Äôs national leadership isn‚Äôt taking chances, going by apparent responses that officialdom has scrambled: Tax authorities had a go at credit-card spending outside the country and the Reserve Bank of India pretty much sentenced the ‚Çπ2,000 note to death.

These hurriedly-announced decisions‚Äîa call for notes to be returned to banks during peak summer months takes an uncommon deficiency of empathy‚Äîaim at burnishing the government‚Äôs credentials for reducing corruption and soaking the rich. They might seem like minor inconveniences eventually.

For, if political analysts have got it right, then the bigger worry for the economy is the rural Karnataka voters‚Äô snub to the BJP‚Äôs brand of welfarism. The party claims to have created a ‚Äúlabharthi"" class of beneficiaries. Dissatisfaction in this self-aware vote bank can set off competitive populism among political parties. A game of catch-up could be on the cards.

We have seen this play out before. In the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Odisha and Telangana state governments tried to relieve rural distress and improve agriculture‚Äôs viability by giving money to farmers. The central government felt challenged, and started doing the same through the PM-Kisan scheme. Income supplements for farmers aren‚Äôt bad economics. Minimum support prices distort market signals to farmers on what to produce and how much, but direct transfers don‚Äôt do that. However, the failure was that the government missed an opportunity to convert distortionary farm subsidies, such as on water and power, into income supplements. The merits of this reform are difficult to explain in a noisy political environment. It is pending and likely to remain so. Meanwhile, income supplements for other vote banks‚Äîminus necessary accompanying reforms‚Äîbegan to look like a distinct possibility.

Taking a lead in the run-up to the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress party has turned up the knob on populism. It successfully restarted a debate on pensions, forcing several state governments to go back to the old pension scheme (OPS) for their employees, unmindful of the burden this will put on their exchequers. Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have announced a return to OPS and Himachal Pradesh is also expected to do so. Punjab is reviewing it.

The Narendra Modi government at the Centre has not been able to resist this challenge of populism. It has constituted a panel to look into improving pensions for government employees, a class of voters that isn‚Äôt in distress.

Among others, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the erstwhile Planning Commission chaired by then prime minister Manmohan Singh, has cautioned that going back to the OPS will bankrupt governments. The OPS was stopped by the A.B. Vajpayee government in December 2003 because it was not sustainable.

In Karnataka, the Congress government decided on its first day in office to implement its campaign promises: 200 units free electricity per month to every household, ‚Çπ2,000 every month to every women head of a family, 10kg of rice every month to every member of below-poverty-line families, ‚Çπ3,000 to all unemployed graduates, ‚Çπ1,500 to all 18-25 year-old unemployed diploma holders every month for two years and free travel for women in public transport buses. In its 2019 Lok Sabha campaign, the Congress had promised income support under its Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY) of ‚Çπ72,000 a year to India‚Äôs poorest families. It will probably reissue that promise for the polls next year.

The danger then would be that the Centre, under pressure to respond with a big-buck scheme of its own, would go ahead even though it has not created the fiscal space necessary to make such spending feasible. Blame a failure to improve India‚Äôs tax-to-GDP ratio from the under-12% level it has been for years, trailing most comparable economies.

Fiscal unaffordability is a worry, but not the chief one. Karnataka may be in a position to afford sops. The trouble is India is responding to economic pain with populism and appeasement‚Äîthe sort of political giveaways that offer no sure path out of economic difficulties. Only sustainable livelihoods can deliver economic security and also expand our consumption market by enhancing people‚Äôs ability to spend, a must for our economy to grow sustainably.

It is widely agreed that India‚Äôs economy isn‚Äôt generating the number of jobs required by millions of low-skill youngsters. Governments have been under the impression that ‚Äòwelfare‚Äô spending can compensate for these failures. Money‚Äîeven speedy, leakage-proof digital transfers‚Äîcannot substitute for quality livelihoods.

Our economic model isn‚Äôt delivering for all Indians. Repairing it requires sound policy advice from economists and technocrats, which governments seem allergic to. Good bureaucrats often have reserves of bad ideas for when the political temperature heats up. Political conviction in reforms appears to be on the wane. Both the Congress and BJP seem ready to tear down the progressive economic policies of their earlier PMs. That can‚Äôt be good for the economy.

Replenishments were particularly strong in the festival months and states such as Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh, according to CMS Info Systems, which has a 46% share in ATM cash management.

While data released by the Reserve Bank of India, such as currency in circulation and ATM withdrawals, may show the real pulse of the economy, ATM cash replenishments could also be an important yardstick to gauge the country‚Äôs economic health.

The company‚Äôs data aligns with RBI data, according to which the value of cash withdrawals at ATMs grew nearly 6% in FY23, with over 4,000 ATMs being added. While catering to the growing demand in the economy, higher ATM cash replenishments‚Äîto service higher cash withdrawals‚Äîcan also be attributed to higher inflation during the year. A quarterly comparison revealed a much sharper average growth (25%) in monthly replenishment per ATM during the June-ended quarter of 2022 due to base effect, as average replenishments had dipped to just ‚Çπ97 lakh per ATM in May 2021 during the second wave of the pandemic.

Replenishments gradually picked up in the following months with growing signs of recovery and gathered further steam during festivities and the wedding season between October and December in both years.

‚ÄúCulturally, there is a long-standing tradition of gifting cash during festivals and weddings, and the higher-than-usual ATM cash replenishments endorse the societal behaviour along with increased usage of cash for shopping during the festive and wedding seasons,"" said Rajiv Kaul, chief executive of CMS Info Systems.

Cash utilization levels across 23 states whose data was collated exhibited an interesting trend. Eleven states had a higher average cash replenishment per ATM than the national average in FY23. Karnataka led with ‚Çπ1.73 crore per month, followed by Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh with average cash replenishment of ‚Çπ1.58 crore and ‚Çπ1.57 crore, respectively. By size, the top five state economies together accounted for 43.1% of the total ATM cash replenished by CMS Info Systems across the country.

Further, tracking the changes in replenishment in the last two years across these regions highlighted another noteworthy trend.

Delhi topped the charts with 23.8% growth in cash replenishments last fiscal, the only north Indian state in the top five list. Southern states Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala took the second, third and fourth spots, with 18.1%, 15.8% and 14.7% growth. Maharashtra came fifth with 13.7% growth in cash replenishments.

Bihar and Jharkhand also found berths in the top ten. Only three states‚ÄîMadhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jammu and Kashmir‚Äîwitnessed a decline in ATM cash replenishments last fiscal.

Overall, the cumulative cash replenishment by CMS Infosystems through the year increased by 16.6%, but the exact value was unavailable.

While digital payments have changed how the country transacts, factors such as an unbanked population, cultural influences, infrastructure challenges, and a slower pace of financial and digital literacy still keep cash relevant."

With India's position as the world's most populous country and the fifth-largest economy, these challenges could impede investment in the country's manufacturing and infrastructure sectors, it added.

Moody's Investors Service underscored the significance of addressing these barriers to fully unlock India's growth potential. Limited economic liberalization and slower policy implementation pose threats to the country's investment landscape, according to the report.

The report pointed out that rising per capita income and a growing working-age population are driving consumption in India. The presence of a young and educated workforce, the increasing number of nuclear families, and rapid urbanization contribute to a strong demand for housing, cement, and new cars. The government's focus on infrastructure spending further strengthens the steel and cement industries, while India's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions drives investments in renewable energy.

Moody's considers the larger production capacity in these sectors as a credit positive for rated companies, as long as they effectively manage execution risks with financial discipline.

Looking ahead to 2030, India has set ambitious goals to achieve significant growth across multiple sectors. The manufacturing and infrastructure sectors are expected to grow at an annual rate of 3% to 12% throughout the decade. However, India's capacity is projected to remain behind that of China, which currently holds a stable A1 rating from Moody's.

Leading companies in India are planning investments of around $150 billion to expand capacity, necessitating access to multiple funding sources. Moody's notes that most rated companies can handle a rise in debt to support these investments.

The success of India's infrastructure development and transition to green energy depends on substantial investment. Favorable policies and cost competitiveness are expected to support India's target of tripling its renewable energy capacity to 500 gigawatts by 2030.

Additionally, increased investments in airports will drive rapid expansion in the aviation sector. The ability of rated companies to deliver on planned investments will rely on the availability of funding, with the private sector playing a crucial role. However, Moody's warns that leverage for rated companies involved in the rollout is expected to remain high.

With central bank controls in place, corporate growth in India is anticipated to be primarily funded domestically. A cost ceiling on foreign-currency borrowings restricts cross-border issuance to blue-chip companies. Consequently, banks and the domestic bond market will play a significant role in financing new investments. Indian banks have the capacity to expand their loans by approximately 15% over the next two years, with private sector banks well-positioned for growth.

Despite the positive outlook, Moody's emphasizes the risks posed by reform and policy barriers to the pace of investment in India's manufacturing and infrastructure sectors. The complexity of decision-making bureaucracy reduces India's attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment, especially when compared to competing developing economies in the region such as Indonesia and Vietnam.

Challenges related to prolonged project gestation, including uncertainties around land acquisition approvals, regulatory clearances, license procurement, and business setup procedures, further compound the situation. India's limited multilateral liberalization in regional trade agreements is also expected to weigh on foreign investments.

Moody's acknowledges the ongoing efforts by the Indian government to combat corruption, formalize economic activity, and strengthen tax collection and administration. These endeavors, if effectively implemented, hold the potential to drive higher economic growth.

Addressing reform and policy barriers becomes crucial as India aims to unlock its economic potential and attract investments. Moody's Investors Service highlights the importance of sustained efforts to promote economic liberalization and ensure efficient policy implementation. By doing so, India can solidify its position as a vibrant and prosperous global economy.

The monthly primary consumer sentiment index (PCSI) is an aggregation of four sub-indices that captures how a set of consumers feel about their jobs, economic expectations, investment climate and personal financial conditions.

Interestingly, in May, all four sub-indices reported an uptick compared to the previous month.

The PCSI employment confidence or job sub-index is up 4.4 points; the PCSI economic expectations sub-index is up 2.3 points while the PCSI investment climate sub-index is up 2.5 points. The PCSI current personal financial conditions sub-index is up 3 points over last month.

‚ÄúConsumer confidence of urban Indians has improved over the previous month and Indians are more confident about snagging jobs, feel positive about their personal finances, investments and have more confidence in the country‚Äôs economy.

Since we are going to be bombarded with a number of misleading claims on what those numbers signify, this column is meant to vaccinate you against those assertions.

The gross domestic product (GDP) of any country is widely considered to be an important barometer of its economic health. Given that it is used as a universal denominator to standardize levels of public debt (using the debt-GDP ratio) or stock market capitalization (market cap-GDP ratio) across time and space, movements in GDP and its subcomponents attract a great deal of attention. Unfortunately, the process through which GDP is compiled does not get enough attention. Hence, most analyses of the GDP numbers do not take into account their limitations.

This is a curious historical anomaly, since the pioneers of national accounting‚ÄîColin Clark, Simon Kuznets, J.M. Keynes, and V.K.R.V. Rao‚Äîwere all intimately aware of the errors involved in estimating national income estimates. In his 1941 book National Income and Its Composition, Kuznets derived error estimates for each sector of the American economy. His analysis suggested that the estimates of American national income were subject to an error margin of +/- 10%. Rao, alongwith P.C. Mahalanobis and D.R. Gadgil, arrived at similar error margins for India in the final report of the National Income Committee in 1954.

The examples set by these pioneers were lost on their followers. Modern-day national accountants do not provide any error estimates while publishing national accounts figures. This leads many who are unfamiliar with national accounting methods to believe that such errors simply don‚Äôt exist.

The consequences of such errors can be staggering, and can be illustrated with a simple example. Consider an economy with high quality databases, Perfect Land, where the reported GDP is estimated with an error margin of +/-1% each year. Suppose the reported size of its economy was 1,000 in 2021 and 1060 in 2022. This means that the actual range for the size of the economy was [990, 1010] in 2021 and [1049, 1071] in 2022. Perfect Land‚Äôs reported GDP growth in 2022 was 6% [(1060-1000)/1000] but its actual growth rate could have been anywhere between 8% [(1071-990)/1000] and 4% [(1049-1010)/1010].

Now consider another economy, Imperfect Land, where the databases used for national accounting have several holes. Suppose it reported the same GDP figures for 2021 and 2022 as Perfect Land, but those came with error margins of +/-5%. It can be shown that a reported growth rate of 6% for Imperfect Land would mean actual growth anywhere between 17% and -4%. Year-on-year growth rates in this case almost lose meaning. Any growth comparison between Perfect Land and Imperfect Land would also turn out to be misleading.

India‚Äôs national accounts system perhaps lies somewhere between Perfect Land and Imperfect Land. Given the weaknesses in India‚Äôs statistical system, annual data on many sectors is unavailable. India‚Äôs national accountants use outdated data, heroic assumptions and rough proxies to fill these gaps in the national accounting database. Hence, the first step to make sense of our growth rates is to put an error band around GDP figures and GDP growth rates. You can apply your own judgement on how big those error bands should be, depending on whether you think India is closer to Perfect Land or Imperfect Land.

Second, even if the final GDP estimates of a country are as accurate as those of Perfect Land, the provisional GDP estimates may still have wide error margins and resemble those of Imperfect Land. This is true for all countries, but more so for developing countries such as India, where reliable high-frequency indicators are unavailable for many sectors. So it is wise to factor in wider error bands for provisional or advance or quarterly estimates of GDP. These estimates are calculated using a quick-and-dirty method that Indian national accountants are not very proud of. But it is these ‚Äòkuccha‚Äô estimates that are used most by economists and policymakers.

Third, the error bands for sectoral components of GDP are likely to be much higher than for the aggregate. This also reflects in revision patterns. A 2017 analysis of GDP revisions by the economists Amey Sapre and Rajeswari Sengupta showed that the extent of revisions was much more for some sectors such as mining and trade than for agriculture. Since some sectoral revisions tended to cancel out others, the extent of revisions in the aggregate GDP figure were less than the average sectoral revision.

Fourth, look at a broader set of indicators to cross-check what the national accounts statistics are telling you. If alternate indicators for a particular sector paint a similar picture as the national accounts data, there is good reason to believe it. If there is a mismatch, you should treat the national account estimates with caution. Finally, ignore the circus around growth forecasts. When an army of national accountants is unable to provide a final estimate of GDP in the year gone by, there is little reason to believe that any economist can forecast next year‚Äôs growth rate till the first decimal.

So, the usual prevailing interest rate policy is not very effective in maintaining a reasonable level of output, and low and stable inflation.

Also, we are not always conscious that the prevailing interest rate policy includes a quasi tax-subsidy scheme. In a recession, when RBI lowers the interest rate, it gives a quasi subsidy to borrowers and simultaneously imposes a quasi tax on savers. So, the policy is blunt, as it affects savers and not just borrowers. Savers include the middle class and retirees; they are hit when interest rates are low.

Furthermore, changes in interest rates affect asset prices. This can, in turn, affect banking stability (this is happening in the US and even Europe at present). So, the prevailing policy is problematic again.

Tinkering with the prevailing policy, now and then, will no longer do. We need an alternative policy. This too involves a tax-subsidy scheme, but the working and the institutional set-up turn out to be very different. A simplified version of parts of the new policy solution in case of a closed economy is presented here. This is based on this author‚Äôs forthcoming book, Macroeconomics and Asset Prices: Thinking Afresh on Policy.

Let us begin with the obvious. An interest rate is a relative price. It can be determined by market forces of demand and supply. However, such an interest rate may not be right. It is proposed that the ministry of finance (MoF) intervenes and uses a clear tax-subsidy scheme on the ‚Äòadvice‚Äô of a new and independent advisory body. All this is instead of the central bank using a quasi tax-subsidy scheme.

The proposed policy to be carried out by the MoF would pave the way for RBI to focus on one objective, which is maintaining low and stable (core) inflation. It can do so by using the money that it issues, and not the interest rate, as its key policy tool; basically, the interest rate needs to be left to the market and MoF.

Under the proposed policy, the MoF affects the interest rate for the purpose of maintaining real investment and aggregate output more generally, and RBI uses the money it issues to take care of inflation. We now have two objectives and two policy tools!

Under the proposed policy, RBI may need to consider what the MoF does and vice-versa, but in principle, there is no trade-off in policymaking. This is because the clear tax-subsidy scheme is not a mere replacement of the quasi tax-subsidy scheme; it is an additional and separate policy tool.

We have had a need for coordination between the MoF and RBI in the context of the prevailing policy as well; this is about the fiscal deficit and its possible impact on inflation. However, the coordination in the proposed policy is different; this is about the clear tax-subsidy scheme that can affect the interest rate and money.

The proposed clear tax-subsidy scheme is for real investment. It is not for financial investment. And, it is for borrowers, not for savers. So, it is well-targeted and not blunt.

But what about incidence? Under the proposed policy, the MoF gives a subsidy. This raises the demand for funds and so the interest rate observed in the market moves up towards the normal level, even as the effective interest rate for borrowers in the context of real investment goes down. Given that the interest rate observed in the market moves towards the normal level, asset prices and interest incomes are, ceteris paribus, moved towards normal levels as well; these are not destabilized.

A similar analysis can be used to show the usefulness of the proposed interest rate policy in an economic boom.

An interest rate policy is no panacea. And the point is not that it should include subsidies or taxes. That is happening anyway. The point is to switch from a quasi tax-subsidy scheme to a clear tax-subsidy scheme that is effective and well-targeted. And, given that it is well-targeted, it is also relatively small-sized. Though there may be some misuse of the proposed scheme, note that the prevailing scheme can be availed widely by its very nature.

We may say that the prevailing quasi tax-subsidy scheme run by RBI is self-financing; the quasi tax on one group is used to implicitly finance the quasi subsidy for another group within the same period. In contrast, the proposed clear tax-subsidy scheme implies some rise in the fiscal deficit in a recession and a reduction in the fiscal deficit during a boom, but all this is desirable; it is consistent with Keynesian fiscal policy.

The trade-off between policy objectives is different from the trade-off between ‚Äòguns and butter‚Äô. The latter is inescapable. The former is not, if we use the proposed policy.

Some aspects of the prevailing policy may resemble some parts of the proposed policy (for example, changing reserve money after considering the money multiplier and velocity of money). But on the whole, the proposed policy is very different. It can be far more useful.

265,mint,Downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation: Finance Ministry,https://www.livemint.com/economy/downside-risks-to-growth-and-upside-risks-to-inflation-finance-ministry-11684762625765.html,22 May 2023,,"NEW DELHI : India's economic growth and inflation are likely to witness risks from uncertain stemming from weather conditions, the department of economic affairs under the finance ministry said in its monthly economic report for April, even as it mentioned the upside from domestic consumption.

‚ÄúThere are downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation, partly channelled through the external sector and partly originating from weather uncertainties,"" the ministry said.

While it noted that inflationary pressures across countries were waning on the back of easing international commodity prices barring precious metals, following weakened prospects for global demand and improving supply chains, it cautioned that price levels may continue to remain above pre-pandemic levels if geo-political tensions intensify, weather conditions become unfavourable, higher than anticipated demand emerges from China or if oil supplies tighten up more than anticipated levels.

‚ÄúPrices of commodities sensitive to El Ni√±o effects, such as coffee, rice, palm oil, and natural rubber, need to be continuously monitored,"" it said.

Softening of international prices affected India‚Äôs inflation favourably with WPI inflation declining to 33-month low of -0.9% in April 2023, after remaining in double digits for 18 months. Retail inflation also gradually declined from a peak of 7.8% in April 2022 to an 18-month low of 4.7% in April this year. Sticky core inflation has moderated significantly to almost a three-year low in April, signalling a pass-through of lower input costs by producers.

However, the government is expecting tailwinds that are expected from domestic consumption, which has seen steady growth, and from investments into capacity creation and real estate. ‚ÄúYet a strong point going India‚Äôs way is the strength of its domestic demand. Consumption has shown steady and broad based growth, while investment in capacity creation and real estate is finding traction,"" it added.

The government is also expecting bumper harvest of food grains in FY23. Good prospects for the kharif season in FY24 are expected to keep food inflation low in the upcoming months.

‚ÄúThe forecast of a normal monsoon, surplus water reservoir levels, adequate availability of seeds and fertilisers, and robust tractor sales augurs well for a healthy kharif sowing season starting in June 2023,"" it said. It also added that despite unseasonal rains, there will be smooth public procurement of wheat, which will augment food security. The report noted that food grains production is expected to be at 32.4 crore tonnes, 2.5% higher than the previous year‚Äôs estimate and achieving record production levels for the seventh consecutive year. Besides food grain, production of oilseeds and sugarcane production is also estimated to reach record production levels.

It also highlighted high frequency indicators in April, that appeared to be promising. For instance, GST collections showing commercial activity of March, were pushed up by the widening of the tax base and heightened economic activity. Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and Eight Core Industries Index (ECI) averaged steady growth in Q4 of FY23, added to capacity utilisation hovering close to 75% two quarters earlier. Air passenger traffic in the last quarter of FY23 finally moved beyond pre-pandemic levels. PMI manufacturing was at a four-month high in April 2023, while PMI-services, in the same month, expanded at the fastest pace in 13 years. Within the services sector, rail freight and port cargo traffic posted their best growth performances for April in many years.

The ministry added that it was hopeful of a good year ahead even as April was too early to provide the full forecast for the year.

‚ÄúMost of the withdrawn ‚Çπ2,000 rupee notes are expected to be returned by the deadline of September 30. The decision was part of currency management. ‚Çπ2,000 currency notes continue to be legal tender,"" Das said.

He also said that the deadline of September 30 for the exchange of ‚Çπ2000 notes was decided so that people take the process seriously and it does not become endless.

""...Time is given up to Sept 30 (for exchange of notes) so that it is taken seriously, otherwise, if you leave it open-ended, it becomes a kind of an endless process,"" Shaktikanta Das said in an interaction with the media.

‚ÄúWe have clearly explained in our press note that the ‚Çπ2000 notes were primarily issued for the purpose of quickly replenishing the value of money which was being taken out from the system when the legal tender status of then-prevailing ‚Çπ1000 and ‚Çπ500 notes was withdrawn..(demonetization). That purpose has been fulfilled, today there are enough notes in circulation, of other denominations,"" he added.

He stated that the Indian currency management system is very robust, and the exchange rate has remained stable despite the crisis in financial markets due to the Ukraine war and the failure of certain banks in the West, PTI reported.

Das said that the impact of the withdrawal on the Indian economy will be ‚Äòvery very marginal‚Äô as ‚Çπ2,000 currency notes made up for just 10.8% of the total currency in circulation.

He added that ‚Çπ2,000 rupee notes were introduced primarily to replenish the currency that was withdrawn following the 2016 demonetization.

While the withdrawn 2,000 rupee notes can either be deposited in bank accounts or exchanged for other currency, banks have been advised to make necessary arrangements for exchange, he said.

‚ÄúWe expect most of the ‚Çπ2,000 banknotes to come back to the exchequer by September 30. We have more than adequate quantities of printed notes already available in the system, not just with RBI but with currency chests operated by banks. There is no reason to worry. We have sufficient stocks, no need to worry,"" the RBI Governor further said.

RBI, he said, was sensitive to difficulties faced by people and would come out with regulations if need be.

‚ÄúThe existing income tax requirement of furnishing PAN for deposits of ‚Çπ50,000 or more in bank accounts will continue to apply for deposits of the withdrawn 2000 rupee notes,"" he said, adding that liquidity in the system is being monitored on a daily basis.

India's demand for fuel is rising due to a combination of factors such as increased industrial activity, robust domestic consumption, and profitable refining from record Russian crude imports. Refiners in India have become Russia's key oil client, purchasing discounted crude that Western nations have shunned since the invasion of Ukraine. Indian refiners pay for most of their Russian oil via Dubai-based traders in UAE dirhams instead of US dollars. However, if the price of Russian crude rises above the G7 price cap, traders may have to seek alternative methods of payment, which could aid Russia's efforts to de-dollarize its economy in response to Western sanctions."

This time it is the highest banknote ‚Çπ2000 which will not be issued by banks anymore. However, RBI has directed banks to help customers in exchanging their ‚Çπ2000 notes or deposits in this denomination. One can't help but remember the so-called demonetisation move that hit the country in November 2016. However, there is a difference though. The withdrawal of ‚Çπ2000 banknotes is not expected to be less disruptive than compared the scrapping of 86% of India's currency in circulation over 6 years ago.

According to analysts and economists, Reuters reported that while the government and the central bank did not specify the reason for the timing of the move, however, it comes ahead of state and general elections in the country when cash usage typically spikes.

The move ahead of general elections is seen as a wise decision.

Rupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at L&T Finance Holdings told Reuters that ‚Äúthis withdrawal will not create any big disruption, as the notes of smaller quantity are available in sufficient quantity."" He added, ""Also in the past 6-7 years, the scope of digital transactions and e-commerce has expanded significantly.""

However, Yuvika Singhal, an economist at QuantEco Research pointed out that small businesses and cash-oriented sectors such as agriculture and construction may face inconvenience in the near term.

Also, Singhal highlighted that to the extent that people holding these notes chose to make purchases with them rather than deposit them in bank accounts, there could be some spurt in discretionary purchases such as gold

On the impact on banks, Madhavi Arora, an economist at Emkay Global Financial Services stated that since all the 2000-rupee notes will come back in the banking system, we will see a reduction in cash in circulation and that will in turn help improve banking system liquidity.

Meanwhile, Karthik Srinivasan, Senior Vice President of Financial Sector Ratings, at ICRA said, ""As witnessed during demonetisation, we expect the deposit accretion of banks could improve marginally in near term. This will ease the pressure on deposit rate hikes and could also result in moderation in short-term interest rates.""

Only 10.8% of India's currency in circulation is being withdrawn!

As per RBI's data, about 89% of ‚Çπ2000 notes were issued prior to March 2017 and are at the end of their estimated life-span of 4-5 years. The total value of these banknotes in circulation has sharply declined to ‚Çπ3.62 lakh crore constituting only 10.8% of notes in circulation as of March 31, 2023 --- from ‚Çπ6.73 lakh crore at its peak as on March 31, 2018, which was 37.3% of Notes in Circulation at that time.

RBI has directed the public that they can either deposit ‚Çπ2000 banknotes into their bank accounts and/or exchange them for banknotes of other denominations at any bank branch.

However, RBI announced a limit of ‚Çπ20,000 on exchanging the ‚Çπ2000 banknotes starting from May 23 to September 30, 2023. This is done to avoid disruption of the regular activities of bank branches.

But it also needs to be noted that ‚Çπ2000 denomination banknote will still continue to be legal tender even after September 30, 2023.

According to S. Ravi Promoter & Managing Partner, Ravi Rajan & Co. LLP, the 2000 rupee note will continue to be legal tender for normal transactions till 30th September, according to S. Ravi, an expert on the matter. He further explained that there is a limit of exchanging 20,000 rupees at a time, and any amount exceeding that can be deposited in one's bank account as per the set norms.

Regarding the impact on the economy, Ravi stated, ""The effects will be temporary, and the Reserve Bank of India providing clear guidelines and FAQs, there is expected to be reduced panic compared to the time of demonetization. The increased adoption of digital transactions and the availability of 100 and 500 rupee denominations will help minimize disruptions for individuals heavily reliant on cash transactions. However, there will be a noticeable reduction in the overall cash circulation.""

When asked about the withdrawal of the 2000 rupee notes, Ravi pointed out that the Reserve Bank of India had printed 3.7 billion 2000 rupee notes, amounting to 7.4 trillion rupees thus far. The decision to discontinue printing these notes was anticipated, as RBI had not printed fresh 2000 rupee notes since 2019. It is interesting to note that the detection of 13,604 counterfeit notes of the 2000 rupee denomination during the 2021-22 financial year, rerepresents 54.6% increase from the previous year.

""This decision aligns with the RBI's 'Clean Note Policy' and aims to eliminate low-velocity notes from circulation,"" Ravi added. He emphasized that such measures are not uncommon, citing the example of the United Kingdom introducing polymer notes in 2016 to enhance security features and reduce counterfeiting.

Regarding the absence of 2000 rupee notes as the largest denomination, Ravi stated, ""It will have minimal impact, similar to the situation in the United States, where the largest currency denomination is $100.""

In conclusion, the Reserve Bank of India's decision to phase out 2000 rupee notes supports the objectives of the 'Clean Note Policy.' While the economy may experience temporary effects, the availability of smaller denominations and the growing digital transactions landscape are expected to mitigate disruptions caused by the reduction in cash circulation, Ravi added.

The report, however, underscored the high cost of funds and weak external demand that will continue to pose challenges for investments and exports.

India's official estimate for current financial year ending March 2024 is a 6.5% growth.

The UN report also forecasts a growth rate of 6.7% for India in calendar year 2024, indicating a positive outlook for the country's economic performance in the coming years.

""India's economy, the largest in the South Asia region, is expected to grow by 5.8% in 2023 and 6.7% in 2024 (on a calendar year basis), driven by resilient domestic demand. However, elevated interest rates and subdued external demand will continue to weigh on investment and exports in 2023,"" stated the report.

Despite this growth trajectory, the report highlights that India's economy still faces challenges in achieving pre-pandemic growth levels.

The report further notes that inflation in India is anticipated to decelerate to 5.5% in 2023, as global commodity prices stabilize and a slower currency depreciation reduces imported inflation.

In April, India's retail inflation reached an 18-month low of 4.70%, according to data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on 12 May. The consumer price index (CPI) remained below the upper threshold of the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4%¬±2.

The Reserve Bank of India decided to maintain the policy rate at 6.5% in April 2023, following a cumulative increase of 250 basis points since May 2022.

The report also warns of a prolonged period of low growth and highlights the enduring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change as factors contributing to the uncertain global economic outlook.

For many developing countries, including those in Africa and Latin America, tightening credit conditions and rising costs of external financing have led to deteriorating growth prospects. GDP per capita in these regions is projected to increase only marginally this year, reinforcing a longer-term trend of stagnant economic performance.

Additionally, the report points out that the least developed countries are expected to grow at a rate below the target set in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.

""The current global economic outlook presents an immediate challenge to delivering on the SDGs,"" said UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, Li Junhua.

""The global community must urgently address the growing shortages of funding faced by many developing countries, strengthening their capacities to make critical investments in sustainable development and helping them transform their economies to achieve inclusive and sustained long-term growth.""

While the initial storm seems to have passed, the question of contagion across financial institutions was front and centre in global markets for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. For obvious reasons, this is a worthwhile moment to pause and take stock of risk mitigation in our own financial system here in India.

Since 2008, Indian financial markets have come a long way. It is easy to become captivated by headline figures‚Äîsuch as India‚Äôs consistently high economic growth through this period‚Äîbut there have been important policy foundations laid to increase local resiliency among our financial players and the economy at large.

One underappreciated enabler of this period of relative calm has been the dual supervisory and developmental role that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has played. Broadly speaking, policy measures taken by the central bank in response to major global headwinds in recent times have been nuanced and tailored to meet the demands of each situation.

Most recently, in the wake of the covid pandemic, RBI turned to unconventional measures like Long-Term Repo Operations (LTROs), targeted LTROs and special refinance facilities for financial institutions. The success of special open-market operations under ‚ÄòOperation Twist‚Äô demonstrated the regulator‚Äôs agility in the face of uncontrollable external shocks. Importantly, these central bank responses to the covid crisis were carried out without any dilution of collateral standards, which ensured that the system remained strong and cushioned from any further external risks.

Liquidity in government-securities and overnight-money markets has also grown, and with narrow bid-ask spreads, price discovery has been efficient. The foreign exchange market has seen strong growth in overall trading volumes and a suite of hedging products are gaining ground, while easing of rules on foreign direct investment (FDI) have led to higher inflows. Much of this growth has come against the backdrop of RBI policy reforms aimed at deepening onshore financial markets and increasing the efficiency of price discovery.

India‚Äôs digital payments system is now widely acknowledged as one of the most robust and innovative in the world; and the ‚ÄòIndia Stack‚Äô is revolutionizing access to finance for over 1.4 billion people. Likewise, this same system is creating a bedrock of important financial data which will allow regulators and market participants alike to better understand the health of our economy.

The enabling, yet cautious stance of RBI has resulted in India‚Äôs financial institutions developing a growing level of sophistication in terms of their technology and workflows. Some of the leading Indian banks have put in place robust technological solutions to meet regulatory demands of doing business in a more globally connected world. It is not uncommon for large Indian banks to adopt turnkey solutions from global technology providers, including Bloomberg, to meet specific needs like their transition from Libor to Risk Free Rates or the calculation of initial margin requirements for compliance with Uncleared Margin Rules (UMR).

Going forward, meeting India‚Äôs growth aspirations will require an even larger financial market. As RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das remarked in a recent speech at the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association and Primary Dealers Association of India (FIMMDA-PDAI) Annual Conference on 27 January 2023, the central bank needs to work with key stakeholders to focus on growing specific areas of financial markets, including deepening the secondary market for government securities, improving liquidity in the interest rate derivative market and improving access of retail investors to derivatives markets.

Steady and stable growth of Indian financial markets in the past decades has built an ideal launchpad for the next level. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that the system is immune to old as well as new risks. As Indian banks and financial institutions stride into this exciting new phase with an expanded range of products and newer market participants, they will face elevated levels of risk too.

Indian banks that harbour the ambition to grow globally will have to proactively prepare and equip themselves with more sophisticated and efficient systems to optimize their workflows and strengthen risk management, portfolio monitoring and compliance.

Making the most of this sense of cautious optimism within the Indian financial system hinges on how it stays adequately shielded from risk over this upcoming journey. Sustainable, meaningful growth in the Indian financial markets is on the table. With a strong enabling environment in place, the focus is now on market participants to walk the walk.

Rightly, there will be ample discussion this year about how to showcase India‚Äôs achievements to the world by means of the country‚Äôs current G20 presidency. While the global economy is poised to throw up plenty of challenges in the years ahead, the quiet but remarkable levelling up of Indian financial institutions isn‚Äôt something that should get lost in the shuffle.

277,mint,Why India seems short of sympathy for its middle class,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/why-india-seems-short-of-sympathy-for-its-middle-class-11684083955334.html,14 May 2023,,"Nirvana Country is an almost beautiful island in the vast dismal ugliness of Gurugram. Some residents call it ‚ÄúUnitech‚Äôs folly"" because the colony has broad tree-lined pathways, pretty parks with flower beds and little green mounds, and there are other hints of builder generosity, which is rare in India. Public life here appears to be good. Happy old men amble in groups talking about the importance of authoritarianism; their wives sit in a circle and sing; an American with a mohawk teaches teenaged girls karate; and some boys are so posh they can‚Äôt bowl. The place was even prettier about 15 years ago. So, at the time, when Unitech announced the making of Nirvana II, just a few kilometres away, hundreds rushed to book villas.

The builder was to begin delivery of the homes around 2012, but no one has got possession yet. The builder has since perished, two of its promoters in jail for fraud, and its management has been taken over by bureaucrats. Hundreds of people who sank their savings in the project or had taken huge loans that they still service, have joined lakhs of Indians who trusted various marquee builders, but are yet to get possession of their houses.

The buyers have been seeking the attention of courts, politicians, regulators and the media. Among them, those who booked anything better than cheap housing are at a particular disadvantage. There is no real sympathy for them. In a nation where the bar for what constitutes misery is very high, a delay in the possession of a villa does not count as a misfortune. Judges, bureaucrats, activists, journalists and empathetic beings do not consider the issue trivial, but when set against what an average Indian endures, the completion of a half-dead residential project so that some people can get their villas is not a priority.

There would even be a quarrel over the use of the term ‚Äòmiddle-class‚Äô for villa-owners. By income and assets, they do not represent the median Indian household. For some reason, development economists and their friends revel in the fact the true Indian middle class is much poorer than most people who use terms like ‚Äòmiddle class‚Äô. But then an economic class can exist independent of its nation‚Äôs plight, exhibiting a set of behaviours that are uniform across the world. My own definition of the middle-class is anyone who must work to sustain their present lifestyle; also anyone whose spending confidence depends on a regular income. Seen this way, the middle classes, across the world, share common features. Just that in rich countries, the middle-class form a majority, and in poor countries, they do not, making them politically insignificant, which denies them an important form of sympathy: the political consideration. Being middle-class in a poor country can have some aspects of wealth, but it is a far more fragile condition than the state of being wealthy. A shock like a home-buying decision gone wrong can have disastrous consequences.

Aditya Mishra is a finance executive who invested in a villa in Nirvana II in 2009. Soon after he paid the down payment, construction began. Typically in such projects, payments are staggered and linked to completion of phases. The initial work was brisk. Over the first five years, he paid up about 85% of the villa‚Äôs cost of ‚Çπ1.8 crore. This means, apart from sinking in his own savings, he has been paying an EMI of over ‚Çπ1 lakh every month for the past several years. But the villa that was to be delivered in 2012 is still not his.

The unlucky buyers of Nirvana II have formed a tight group and have been pleading with regulators and bureaucrats. They are careful never to use the word ‚Äúvillas"". Instead, Aditya told me, they use the expression ‚Äúour dream homes"".

On some pleading expeditions, they take their spouses and parents along to demonstrate the emotional nature of their ‚Äúdream home"". The buyers have also asked their banks to restructure their loans, which is a euphemism to permit defaults or reduce the financial burden in some way. But the banks have said that their credit-ratings, open for all to see, will take such a beating that they may never get a bank loan again.

India‚Äôs lack of compassion for him frustrates Aditya, but there is a particular part that irritates him. It comes from his peers. They say he is not in such a bad way because property prices have tripled, or maybe even quadrupled in Gurgaon from the time he had paid the down-payment for his 360 square-yard villa. He says when you consider the money spent on the project over the past 15 years, the returns are not so attractive, even if he might one day get possession. And what is the price one can put on the failed dream to his own corner of the world.

Some of the elderly who wished to live their last lap in their own villas with their families have died fighting for what was their own. Families have aged since they made the fateful error to move to Nirvana II and their children are almost adults today, ready to fly away.

Aditya says it is all so cruel; buyers had faith in Nirvana II because banks had endorsed the project, effectively. So, Aditya asks, why should only individual home-owners pay the price, why not have these banks share their misery? Instead, banks continue to make money off people who have been cheated of their homes for nearly 15 years.

Yet, their pain and rage cannot move the nation. Sorrows, in India, have to submit to a decorum. They need tremendous reasons to be considered sorrows.

The leading economist, with reference to competing with a cheap manufacturing neighbor like China, said that India would benefit from focussing on the service component of manufacturing or services more directly as a trusted global supplier.

‚ÄúOur independent judiciary, our liberal democracy, these are critical advantages if we are to go down this manufacturing service-led growth path because this will enable us to earn the world's trust; it's intrinsically necessary,"" said Rajan in his keynote address at the 'Ideas for India' conference.

Economists expressed concern over slowing manufacturing growth, stating that domestic consumption demand going forward would be crucial given that external demand is likely to remain weak. The previous lowest growth was logged in October 2022 at 4.1%.

Drawing attention to the contradictory results of factory output in March shown between the S&P Global Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index (PMI) and IIP, Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Bank of Baroda, said IIP numbers do not gel with the PMIs announced and hence PMI need to be viewed ‚Äúwith caution"". While the PMI survey showed that factory output was at a three-month high, manufacturing growth, according to IIP, was the slowest in five months. ‚ÄúExport-intensive sectors such as textiles, wearing apparel, leather & related products continue to remain under pressure,"" Rajani Sinha, chief economist, CareEdge, said. ‚ÄúThe poor performance of the consumer goods segment is concerning as consumer durables, as well as non-durables, have contracted in March. Pick-up in investment demand will also be contingent on continued revival in domestic consumption demand.""

Power generation fell by 1.6% in March from a 6.1% growth in the year earlier, largely due to radical changes in temperatures in March compared to historical averages. March was one of the coldest in several decades, compared to March last year when power demand rose to record due to heatwaves.

Amid the Union government‚Äôs announcement of a sharp rise in capital expenditure during the Union budget, infrastructure and construction goods posted a growth of 5.4% compared to a 6.7% expansion in the same period a year ago. Meanwhile, mining output rose by 6.8% in March compared to a growth of 3.9% in the year-ago period. Data further showed that the capital goods segment recorded a growth of 8.1% in March against a growth of 2.4% a year ago. Consumer durables output fell by 8.4% against a contraction of 3.1% a year ago.

Consumer non-durable goods output too declined by 3.1% against a contraction of 4.4% earlier. The data also showed that the output of primary goods logged 3.3% growth in the month against 5.7% in the year-ago period.

Intermediate goods output in March grew by 1% compared to a growth of 1.8% during the corresponding month last year. ‚ÄúThe year-end phenomenon which goes along with production being ramped up in March did not happen this time. The high build-up of inventory in previous months to meet pent-up demand is one reason why companies were cautious in expansion as working capital costs have gone up,"" Sabnavis said.

Retail inflation eased to 4.7% in April from 5.66% in the preceding month, data released by the statistics ministry on Friday showed. This marks the lowest reading since October 2021, when it stood at 4.48%.

With inflation within the central bank‚Äôs comfort zone, economists expect the central bank to keep policy rates unchanged in the next monetary policy meeting in June.

Last month, RBI‚Äôs monetary policy committee (MPC) paused the rate-hike cycle by keeping the key policy rate unchanged at 6.5%. RBI increased rates six times in a row to tame inflation before it decided to pause last month.

Retail inflation accelerated to a multi-year high of 7.79% in April last year, the highest in the previous financial year due to crop damage amid heat waves in the country.

In April of last year, retail inflation soared to a multi-year high of 7.79% due to crop damage from intense heatwaves across the country.

Even as food prices in April were lower than last year, they rose from the preceding month, driven by higher prices of milk, fruits, vegetables and spices. Moreover, inflation in clothing, footwear, housing, transport and education also saw an uptick in April compared to March.

‚ÄúWhile food inflation has further moderated, led by edible oil and cereals inflation, the sequential price momentum in items like milk and pulses remains a concern,"" said Rajani Sinha, chief economist, CareEdge.

However, economists expressed relief on reversing rising cereals and product inflation, driven largely by wheat prices.

‚ÄúThe good part in today‚Äôs inflation number is the reversal of an increasing trend of nine months of rising cereals and products inflation. It appears that the government interventions have helped in arresting increasing inflation of cereals and products,"" said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist and Paras Jasrai, senior analyst at India Ratings.

Economists further said that abnormal heat conditions in March and unseasonal rains seemed to have little impact on wheat pieces as feared. However, they cautioned that the progress of the monsoon would have some impact on cereals and product inflation going forward.

Aditi Nayar, chief economist of ICRA Ltd, said that April was marked by above-average rainfall and lower-than-normal temperatures, which helped to keep the prices of vegetables under check.

‚ÄúWith El Nino expected to materialize only in the second half of the monsoon season, kharif sowing may not be impacted. However, any subsequent deficiency in monsoon rainfall could affect kharif yields and winter sowing, and thereby food inflation, which poses a risk to the CPI inflation trajectory,"" Nayar added.

Monsoon prospects remain critical given that pulses are vulnerable because of limited access to irrigation, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda.

‚ÄúPressure has been seen in the market as traders wait for the new crop in October. Till then, there will be pressure on prices, and inflation will be on the higher side. Edible oils and horticulture are witnessing low and negative inflation,"" Sabnavis added. Sabnavis expressed concern over considerable regional variation in inflation as half the states covered had inflation higher than 5%.

‚ÄúInflation in Uttarakhand and Telangana were above 6%. In five states, inflation stood between 5-6%. In 11 states, inflation was less than 5%,"" Sabnavis added.

282,mint,No relief on milk price till Diwali: Rupinder Sodhi,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/indian-dairy-association-president-milk-prices-to-remain-elevated-until-diwali-but-might-soften-later-11683744140523.html,11 May 2023,,"Milk prices will remain elevated until Diwali but might soften later once the flush season starts and feed prices decline, Indian Dairy Association president Rupinder Singh Sodhi said.

Milk prices have shot up 13-15% in the past 15 months amid a global rise in cereal prices. Production suffered due to insufficient fodder following unseasonal rains, and a decline in the number of lactating cattle in a lag effect of fewer artificial inseminations during the pandemic. The trade enters the flush season from October to February when cattle produce more milk naturally and dairy companies typically lower their procurement price.

Sodhi, former managing director of Amul dairy cooperative, said in an interview that to ensure adequate availability of milk at reasonable prices in the coming two years, farmers will have to be given remunerative prices.

He said the extended cold season till May and erratic rainfall in the past two months will help increase milk production by 5%, despite the normal 15% dip in production during summers.

India‚Äôs milk production is set to rise to 628 million tonnes in the next 25 years from the present 222 MT, said Sodhi, who is also an advisor to Reliance Retail Ventures. Edited excerpts:

Livestock, fishing and aquaculture saw the highest growth in gross value of output in the decade ended 2020-21, while the share of the crops dropped. What could be the possible reasons?

In GDP of agriculture, the contribution of cereals was 37% five decades ago, now it is 17%. The share of milk has increased to 24% from 10%, meat to 8% from 1.6%, eggs to 1.2% from 0.5%.

When prosperity comes over the years, consumers upgrade themselves from carbohydrate-rich food to protein and fat-contained diet from animal source. Whether it is milk or poultry or meat, the reason is simple: they are tastier, nutritionally dense because of their high protein content, and affordable. It is also because of better availability. People find animal-source protein nutritionally rich at very affordable prices.

Do you see further growth in the livestock, fishing and aquaculture sectors?

If you talk about dairy, in the last five decades, dairy production went up by 10 times despite population having grown by 3.5 times. We estimate that in the next 25 years, dairy production, which is currently 222 million tonnes will increase to 628 million tonnes‚Äîthree times higher. Same will be the case for poultry and the fisheries sector.

Today, the contribution of livestock sector in Indian economy is around ‚Çπ14 trillion, out of which, dairy is around ‚Çπ9.5 trillion, poultry around ‚Çπ2.8 trillion, and another ‚Çπ2.5-3 trillion is from the fisheries sector. In the next 10 years, the livestock sector will be around ‚Çπ50 trillion, with a ‚Çπ30 trillion contribution by the dairy sector. Considering the tremendous growth, we feel that India will be an exporter of the livestock sector (cattle, poultry and fisheries) in the coming time.

Milk prices are globally falling, while prices in India are on upswing for a while. What is your take on this?

In the last 13 months, milk prices have declined around 34% globally. Before falling, their prices shot up about 20-25%. Inflation in milk and its products in Europe, the US doubled or tripled compared with India. So, their prices are still higher than the pre-covid level. Demand reduced because of price increase and supply increased because of good prices paid to farmers.

When can we expect domestic dairy companies to cut milk prices?

Milk prices in the last 15 months have increased 3-4 times, which was definitely not expected. Three years ago, due to covid demand reduced and commodity prices crashed. Therefore, the price paid to milk farmers reduced drastically in most states. On the other hand, feed cost increased because of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. This resulted in higher costs of production, and farmers incurring losses. Therefore, farmers were discouraged to continue dairy farming in terms of investing in new animals, feeding better to animals. During covid, due to logistical problems, artificial insemination delayed calving. Lumpy skin disease reduced induction of new animals because of slow inter-state movement of animals.

We know that it is not good for the consumers, considering the growing demand and India having more lower middle-class people, affordability plays a big role. But one must understand how milk is produced. Cattle and buffalo eat seeds and produce milk.

The price you pay to buy a packet of milk is cost to you, but income to farmers. If you don‚Äôt give good prices in the long run, farmers will sell off their animals. This will cause unavailability of milk tomorrow and next year, and you will have to pay double what our neighbouring countries Pakistan and Sri Lanka are paying. To secure a good availability of milk up to the next two years at a reasonable price, we need to pay remunerative price to farmers, so they continue dairy farming.

I don‚Äôt see any room for dairy companies to increase milk prices further. Because of food inflation all over the world, demand growth has shrunk drastically. Similarly, if dairy companies increase prices in India beyond a limit, there is a threat that consumption will decrease. If you are paying good prices to farmers, you can expect good production of milk next year. A little bit of growth in demand will reduce, and production will meet demand, stabilising prices.

Till Diwali, prices are likely to remain firm, and after Diwali, there will be some softness in prices, but it will not have any major impact on consumer prices. The stress that dairy companies are undergoing will ease out.

Softness in prices also depends on feed cost. Over the last two-three months, cereal prices have either stabilised or declined due to the ban on wheat exports and a 20-25% dip in the price of corn, an important ingredient for the livestock sector. We are expecting good rabi crop. This indicates a fall in feed costs.

How much is India‚Äôs annual demand and production, and what is your milk production estimate for 2023-24 (April-March)?

India‚Äôs annual production and consumption is 222MT, which is around 600 million litres per day. Out of the 600 million litres, 40% is consumed by farmers. One third of the remaining 60% is going to the organised sector and two thirds to the unorganised sector. India‚Äôs milk production for the last 10 years is growing at the rate of 5.5%. So, you can expect a minimum of 5% growth next year."

Addressing industry leaders at the CII-ITC Sustainability Awards ceremony, Gadkari stressed the importance of decentralizing development and constructing sustainable business models.

The minister urged the development of homegrown technologies in energy, electric highways, and sustainable utilization of mining wastelands. He proposed using bamboo on wastelands as an alternative to imported coal and highlighted the potential of hydrogen from water and ethanol.

By adopting a circular economy, Gadkari stated that manufacturing costs and imports could be significantly reduced. Recycling metals like copper and aluminum may decrease auto component manufacturing expenses by 20-25%.

Over 1,100 businesses have applied for the awards in the past 17 years, with 375 recognized across 16 categories and 250 indicators, according to Sanjiv Bajaj, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). This year, 79 applicants underwent a comprehensive evaluation process, including on-site assessments by CII-certified sustainability assessors.

Gadkari on Wednesday also reviewed the progress of the Kaziranga Elevated Road project in Assam. The initiative aims to construct approximately 34 kilometers of elevated roads at sites identified by the Wildlife Institute of India, where animal crossings occur.

In a series of tweets, Gadkari stated that the project also involves ‚Äúwidening the intervening at-grade road to a 4-lane highway, totaling approximately 50 kilometers in length, and building tunnels spanning approximately 3 kilometers"".

He said the market may remain muted for the short term and one should monitor the demand environment later this calendar year.

Edited excerpts:

What is your assessment of the current market situation? Is the worst in terms of rate hikes, inflation, and economic slowdown behind us?

For India's economic assessment, crude price is the biggest variable to track. Given that crude prices are rangebound, I would say that the outlook for India may be favourable.

Economic growth is showing signs of a slowdown in the US and can be seen in Indian businesses exporting to the US market.

Our interaction with various exporters out of India does suggest some slowdown in orders at least in the very near term i.e. next 3-6 months.

From an equity market perspective valuation for some segment of the market especially mid-caps remain on the higher side and hence return expectations in the near term is likely to be muted.

What are your thoughts on the Q4FY23 earnings?

Q4FY23 earnings to date are quite healthy with consensus expectations being upgraded led by banks and the auto sector.

What sectors are you positive about? Can we take a contra bet on the IT sector at this juncture?

We are optimistic about manufacturing as a theme. Within sectors, we believe banks, auto ancillaries, speciality chemicals, pharmaceuticals CDMO, telecom, capital goods/engineering, industrials, and real estate are some of the sectors which have a positive risk reward.

The global economic slowdown is likely to remain a headwind for the IT sector over the next 12 months.

Valuations have come down reflecting the headwinds and may see time correction till the earnings outlook improves.

India's economic outlook appears bright. Do you see any concern which can derail economic recovery?

As mentioned earlier, for India the key variable to track is Crude prices which can impact the outlook materially. Apart from this, one needs to monitor the upcoming monsoon season in the near term.

When do you expect a cut in rates by the Fed and RBI?

Bond markets are already reflecting rates lower than the policy rates and hence incrementally predicting central bank actions in terms of timing would not have any impact on the markets.

The current inventory cycle-led commodity price correction may see another spike when/if demand normalises in 2024.

Hence though the short-term outlook on rates is for a pause, one needs to monitor the demand environment later this calendar year.

The economic affairs secretary was speaking with reporters after the meeting of Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDCP), which is chaired by the finance minister and brings together the leading regulators, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The meeting was also attended by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das.

""We see that the global financial situation is daunting but, at the same time, Indian economy and financial sector is well protected and well regulated. But of course we have to be cautious and be on our toes,"" Seth said.

The secretary also said there was a view that the government should expedite the required legislative changes to give effect to the proposals announced in the Union Budget.

The FSDC discussed need for a drive for distribution of unclaimed deposits with financial institutions, Seth added.

Asked whether the council, which was the first FSDC meeting since the 2023/24 union budget was announced on Feb. 1, discussed India‚Äôs exposure to the Western financial system, he said it was not specifically discussed. However, whether spillover can occur and the channels of potential risks were debated.

But it added a rider, which many observers were quick to focus on, and quite rightly. The IMD observed that both its models, and those prepared by others, indicated ‚Äúthat El Ni√±o conditions are likely to develop during the monsoon season.""

The government is concerned as well. The finance ministry‚Äôs latest monthly review of the economy flagged the El Ni√±o risk, pointing out: ‚ÄúIt is important‚Ä¶to be vigilant against potential risks such as El Ni√±o conditions creating drought conditions and lowering agricultural output and elevating prices, geopolitical developments and global financial stability.""

If an El Ni√±o does occur later in the year, as even meteorologists elsewhere in the world predict, it could end the run of good monsoons in the last four years, though this is not certain. India has had good monsoons even in El Ni√±o years, and deficient rainfall in years when the El Ni√±o was not prevalent (Chart 1).

View Full Image Graphics: Mint

But the phenomenon is strong enough and its potential economic effects serious enough for meteorologists across the world to monitor its progress closely. If an El Ni√±o does materialize, what can we expect for the Indian economy in the year ahead?

Little Boy

The El Ni√±o (Spanish for ‚Äòlittle boy‚Äô) refers to shifts in weather conditions between the eastern Pacific Ocean near the coast of South America, and the western Pacific near Australia and Indonesia. In a ‚Äònormal‚Äô year, an area of high pressure develops at the western end of the Pacific Ocean, and a low pressure over the eastern Pacific. This pushes strong winds (the so-called ‚Äòtrade winds‚Äô) eastward towards the coasts of Indonesia and Australia, taking warm water with it, and causing rains near those countries.

These weather conditions can improve, or worsen, the Indian monsoon as well. If the pressure difference between the eastern and western pacific increases, the Indian monsoon can become wetter than normal, as the trade winds are stronger‚Äîa phenomenon known as La Nina. This is what we have seen in the last three to four years.

The El Ni√±o occurs when this pressure difference weakens. In this case, the low pressure moves away from Indonesia and back towards the eastern Pacific, slowing the trade winds and causing weaker rainfall, and possibly even drought across Australia and Asia.

While it‚Äôs not certain that an El Ni√±o year can cause monsoon rainfall to fall seriously short of normal, the link is strong enough. An ICRIER working paper by Shweta Saini and Ashok Gulati in 2014 found that from the 1950s till 2013, there were 14 drought years, of which 11 occurred in El Ni√±o years.

But of the 23 El Ni√±o years in that period, only 11 years resulted in drought. ‚ÄúTherefore, it is very clear that not all El Ni√±o years converted into droughts for India and not all (but most) Indian droughts happened in El Ni√±o years,"" the authors concluded. However, the authors also found that all six drought years after 1980 occurred in El Ni√±o years. Interestingly, the most extreme El Ni√±o year ever, in 1997, was a year when the Indian monsoon was normal, despite dire predictions to the contrary.

The less than perfect cause-and-effect relationship between El Ni√±o years and drought in India are due to a range of other weather patterns which can sometimes work to offset the effects of an El Ni√±o. For instance, similar to the El Ni√±o pattern, there are varying differences between the sea surface temperature and air pressure over the western and eastern Indian Ocean. Shifts in these pressure and temperature differences across the Indian Ocean can work to offset, or reinforce, the effect of the El Ni√±o on the Indian monsoon.

Drought or not, average rainfall is lower in an El Ni√±o year. As Chart 2 shows, agricultural GVA (gross value added) is, as expected, highly correlated with the extent to which the actual rainfall in any given year falls above or below the long-term average.

What is the impact on GDP? An IMF working paper by Paul Cashin, Kamiar Mohaddes and Mehdi Raissi in 2015 looked at the macroeconomic impact of El Ni√±o around the world. For India, they found that an El Ni√±o event causes GDP to contract by 0.15 percentage points in the first quarter after the event, with that impact rising to a cumulative amount of 0.25 percentage points a year later.

‚ÄúThe negative effect of El Ni√±o is rather muted in India, due to a number of mitigating factors,"" the authors found. Among them were the declining share of agriculture in India‚Äôs GVA, and an increasing share of Rabi (winter) crops in agricultural output. ‚ÄúMoreover, due to more developed agricultural markets and policies, rising agriculture yield, and climatological early warning systems, farmers are better able to switch to more drought-resistant and short-duration crops (with government assistance), at reasonably short notice,"" the authors noted.

Complicating the Picture

But this assessment is optimistic. For instance, the study points out that an El Ni√±o, by causing more droughts and higher temperatures, increases the demand for both fuel and non-fuel commodities, causing a spike in commodity prices. The authors found that an El Ni√±o event causes oil prices to rise by 13.9% over the following four quarters, and non-fuel commodities to rise in price by 5.3% over the same period. Thus, this filters through into inflation as well, with the cumulative increase in inflation being estimated at around 0.6 percentage points after four quarters.

Further, while the authors of the IMF paper point to the decreasing share of agriculture in overall GDP as an indicator that the El Ni√±o impact may be more muted, the broader impact of weak rainfall or drought on the rural economy and rural employment are still complex and can be far-reaching.

This is especially true post-covid, given that the proportion of the labour force in agriculture actually rose from 42.5% in 2018-19 to 45.5% in 2021-22, reversing a trend of movement of labour out of agriculture over the previous decade. Thus, developments in the agricultural economy have become more important, not less, in the last few years.

During the last El Ni√±o episode between 2014 and 2016, agricultural growth slowed to less than 1%, but rural wages endured a much more prolonged flattening out in real terms. Even when agricultural growth improved after 2016, rural wages, after being adjusted for inflation, remained subdued, according to a 2019 RBI paper titled ‚ÄòRural Wage Dynamics in India: What Role does Inflation Play?‚Äô

Overall growth in agricultural wages for men, among different categories of labour, varied from 0% to around 6% between November 2014 and November 2022 (the exception being horticultural workers, for whom rose by about 11%). Outside of agriculture, in the critical sector of rural construction, which has acted as a major employer over the last decade, wages for males actually fell in real terms by about two percentage points.

While part of the reason for the weakness in rural wages may have to do with factors other than weak rainfall (for example, demonetization), the net effect is that the El Ni√±o, if it does happen, will occur at a particularly vulnerable time for the rural economy.

There are other indicators that the rural economy is not doing well. In December, for instance, market research firm Nielsen IQ pointed to a sharp disparity between FMCG rural and urban markets for the quarter of September 2022. While urban markets were growing, rural markets were actually declining. In fact, the only way that FMCG companies have actually seen growth in their topline is by hiking prices‚Äîvolume growth between the latter part of 2021 and late 2022 was negative for rural areas, though it saw a small increase in urban areas.

The auto sector is another indicator. Reviewing vehicle sales for the last quarter of 2022-23, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) noted that all categories of vehicles saw double-digit growth in sales except for tractors. For March, two-wheeler sales, FADA noted, were positive. However, it said, ‚ÄúAlthough the two-wheeler segment demonstrated year-on-year growth, it remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels, indicating that rural India is still bearing the burden of high inflationary costs."" Incidentally, FADA also noted that, ‚Äúfor the third consecutive month, US Government agencies have warned of the possibility of El Ni√±o‚Äôs arrival later this year, which could lead to poor monsoons, hampering rural India‚Äôs growth potential.""

Climate Change

The link between Indian agriculture and the El Ni√±o is an old one. The geographer Mike Davis, in his book Late Victorian Holocausts, describes in vivid detail how a series of devastating famines followed El Ni√±o events in the late 19th century in India and across the world, and left millions dead.

What of the future? In the years ahead, the complicating factor is, of course, climate change. Will El Ni√±o years become more frequent or less?

A scientific report published in Nature in 2016 by Sarita Azad and M Rajeevan suggests that we could see more frequent El Ni√±o events in the future. Further, model simulations suggest that ‚Äúmore frequent El Ni√±o events could trigger more droughts over India"".

The headline effect of such droughts on agricultural production is, of course, serious enough. But such events could also trigger far-reaching shifts in the rural economy. For instance, in a paper on the effects of drought on agricultural labour by men and women, Farzana Afridi and co-authors found that after a drought, rural women are 7.1% less likely to be employed than men, but 80% more likely to seek work. Women saw a 19 percentage point greater reduction in working days than men in a drought year.

At the same time, while men are better able to substitute work lost on the farm with work off it, in rural areas, women on the whole are much less able to make that switch. ‚ÄúHence, while men diversify to non-farm sector jobs to cope with droughts, women do not, even as they seek work and their real farm wage earnings (conditional on being employed on the farm) fall by 38.1%,"" the authors say.

Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of the IMD, told Mint in an interview recently that the impact of the El Ni√±o on this year‚Äôs monsoon is likely to be minimal‚Äîthe IMD is for now sticking to its forecast of a normal monsoon. If that happens, that‚Äôs good news. But, even if the Indian monsoon goes off well and agricultural growth is strong, that is little guarantee that El Ni√±o won‚Äôt be back in future years, or that its effects on Indian agriculture and society won‚Äôt be more far-reaching.

292,mint,The simmering debate over poverty rate,https://www.livemint.com/economy/the-simmering-debate-over-poverty-rate-11683142431495.html,05 Jun 2023,,"London/Boston: As the 2024 elections approach, taking stock of the economy after a decade-long rule of the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi becomes a natural talking point. Over the last year, that could be a reason why a debate about India‚Äôs poverty rate‚Äîdubbed the Great Indian Poverty Debate 2.0‚Äîhas started and shows no sign of being settled.

As is well known, the main issue is that appropriate data has not been published by India‚Äôs statistical agencies since 2011-12. The government simply decided not to publish the National Sample Survey Consumer Expenditure Survey results for 2017-18, which, from the analysis of the leaked version of the report, does lend credence to the suspicion that it was because the results would have shown an increase in poverty relative to 2011-12.

View Full Image Graphic: Mint

According to the World Bank‚Äôs earlier $1.90 PPP per day line that defines extreme poverty, 23% of India‚Äôs population was poor in 2011-12, the last estimate we have using official data. The headcount rate for the intervening period is fuzzy. In the absence of official survey data, all the new estimates of poverty that have been proposed are by necessity ‚Äòsynthetic‚Äô‚Äîusing different data sets and assumptions to make the sample comparable with earlier National Sample Survey numbers‚Äîand this makes convergence of views difficult and is likely to keep the debate alive in the foreseeable future.

Under these circumstances, what is a reasonable range within which we can say with some confidence that the current poverty figure would fall? What kind of ‚Äúsmell"" tests can one subject various estimates of poverty to, using other economic indicators that are likely to be correlated with it?

Poverty headcounts are measured as the fraction of population (headcount) below a certain pre-determined monetary living standard (the poverty line). The World Bank compares countries using its universal line as a cutoff for extreme poverty, but national authorities in each country also produce their own lines. The Indian government favours the poverty line proposed by the Tendulkar Committee according to which 22% of the population was in poverty in 2011-12.

Sharp decline?

The ongoing Great Indian Poverty Debate 2.0 was triggered by a set of calculations that appeared last year. In an IMF working paper, Surjit Bhalla, Karan Bhasin and Arvind Virmani took the last official data from 2011-12, and assuming that per-person consumption grew at the same rate as the national accounts consumption figures‚Äîan assumption that has been questioned almost universally‚Äîestimate India had eliminated extreme ($1.90 adjusted for purchasing power parity) poverty just before the pandemic started.

Soon after, a World Bank working paper used a private household survey, the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) carried out by the Centre for Monitoring of the Indian Economy‚Äîwhose representativeness of the poor has been questioned‚Äîto show that while poverty went down very sharply between 2011-12 and 2019-20, at around 10%, it was far from eliminated. In an unusual move, the World Bank has absorbed these results from private sector data on its new poverty website.

A new development over the last few weeks has deflected from the main thrust of this debate. At a paper presented at Columbia University (not yet in the public domain), the former head of NITI Aayog, Arvind Panagariya, argues that even the pandemic did not arrest the trend decline in poverty, contradicting findings that use the CPHS. But Panagariya himself states that his findings are mostly targeted at the period just before and after the start of the pandemic. Panagariya uses a completely different (albeit nationally representative and official) data set‚Äîthe Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)‚Äîpublished by India‚Äôs National Statistical Office and not the World Bank poverty lines and does not tie his findings to the IMF and World Bank studies mentioned earlier. Thus, for the purposes of the ongoing poverty debate, the results of this paper are less relevant for the question of structural decline of poverty in India.

Evidence from agriculture

From an academic standpoint, and in the absence of iterations of the same data, the burden of proof on researchers is twofold: first, they must show a trend in poverty headcounts‚Äîwhich the authors of the IMF and World Bank working papers do, using a substitute for appropriate data‚Äîand secondly, they need to show that the fall in poverty is backed up by other indicators of living standards or engines of poverty reduction, such as growth in productivity or real wages. We believe this second condition has not been fulfilled by any of the contributions to this ongoing poverty debate.

It is a well-known fact that poverty reduction is a low-hanging fruit at the beginning of the growth process, as the modern sector draws in labour from the traditional sectors, but not so much once some amount of poverty has already been eliminated given the inevitable drag of the vast reservoir of surplus labour. Therefore, it is easier to get an economy‚Äôs poverty headcount down from 50% to 20%, but it takes a lot more targeted effort via redistribution to achieve further reduction‚Äîfor instance, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) had a clear and sharp effect of cutting poverty in the late 2000s‚Äîor by absorbing the pool of surplus labour fast enough to raise real wages.

The fundamentals of India‚Äôs economy are less dynamic than often assumed. India‚Äôs poor are mostly concentrated in rural parts, and especially in the poorest (and most populous) states whose per-capita income growth has continued to lag behind the top five richest states of India. The share of India‚Äôs rural population reduced by a mere three percentage points between 2011 and 2020 and at present stands slightly below two-thirds of total population. In nearly every country where poverty has been eradicated by industrialization, we usually observe a sharp and continuous reduction of the share of agriculture in GDP. In India, the share of agriculture declined sharply from the early 1990s through to 2004 but has remained stuck at 16-17% ever since. The decline in share of agriculture in the total labour force has also been modest‚Äîit stands at 43% at present, starting with just around 50% in 2011.

Among other fast-growing emerging economies in Asia (China, Bangladesh, Vietnam), India‚Äôs agricultural share of GDP is the highest. In fact, during the pandemic years, there was a temporary increase in agriculture‚Äôs share of GDP. In addition, given that there has been no significant increase in agricultural productivity or real wages of agricultural workers over the last decade, we can conclude that in rural areas, where the majority of the population resides, living conditions are relatively stationary and less indicative of a period of transformational poverty decline.

The other narrative

Interestingly, and in contrast to the narrative of Indian poverty‚Äôs demise, the alternative narrative‚Äîstable, or even increasing poverty‚Äîis based on estimates which use official and nationally representative data. Pramit Bhattacharya and Sriharsha Devulapalli calculated overall headcount poverty in India at 23% in 2017-18 based on the leaked version of the NSS report that used the Tendulkar line, a marginal increase relative to the figure of 22% in 2011-12. Rural poverty, according to this estimate, increased from 26 to 30%, thus overwhelming a strong decline in urban poverty owing to the weight of the rural population.

Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati Parida derived consumption per-person from the PLFS dataset (the same as Panagariya) and found a slight increase in poverty headcounts (from 22% to 26% over 2011-12 and 2017-18) using the Tendulkar poverty line. Strikingly, using the World Bank‚Äôs $1.90 PPP poverty line on the same survey, we get 23% headcount poverty for 2017-18. All these estimates are closer to 23% headcount poverty as per the 2011-12 World Bank estimates.

A natural response to these issues is the often-touted claim that the government has increased welfare support to the poor in recent years. Here, Bhalla et al‚Äôs own highly optimistic poverty decline itself shows that the public distribution system (PDS) only reduced (by a couple of percentage points) the level, not the trend, in headcount poverty. That is, with PDS, the fraction below the poverty line reduces by a few percentage points in the same year, but the rate of poverty decline stays roughly the same over time. There was certainly a slight upward improvement from the predicted trend during 2020, when rations were increased, but from a structural perspective, there was no causal effect on poverty decline.

Hunger and deprivation

So far, we have argued that the engine of poverty reduction is invisible. But perhaps the same engine had brute force capacity to lift the living standards of the poor. Such downstream effects of lower poverty incidence should be visible in the population by some external metric. Here, again, we see little evidence in the basic standards of living for the entire population.

In 2022, leading government officials chastised the peer-reviewed Global Hunger Index for ranking India below other clearly impoverished countries like Afghanistan. The criticism of rankings using deprivation indices is indeed well founded in the inequality literature, but their underlying inputs are based on well-regarded data from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), which give headcount incidence of deprivation and use the same consistent methodology over two decades. The Hunger Index uses only one population wide metric (the rest apply to children)‚Äîthe fraction of population considered undernourished. In 2000-02, 2006-08 and 2013-15, the respective headcounts for India were 18.4%, 17.5% and 14.8% respectively. By 2019-21, there was no reported improvement‚Äîthe data show that 16.3% of the population remains undernourished. Thus, if poverty did decline as spectacularly as reported, the effect somehow escaped the diets of impoverished Indians.

Individuals are considered vulnerable to poverty if their deprivations are on the margins of poverty, thus increasing their probability of falling back into poverty in the future. A 2022 calculation by UNDP and Oxford‚Äôs Poverty and Human Development Initiative reports unchanged vulnerability to poverty (18% of the population) in India over 2005-06 and 2019-21, using official statistics published by the National Family Health Survey.

Finally, consider the opportunity-security trade-off facing the poor. If there are costs to migrating, and opportunities are sufficient in rural India‚Äîwhich is necessary to explain declining poverty since Indian poverty was concentrated in rural parts‚Äîthen one should expect a returning migrant to remain in the countryside, rather than migrating back to the city. The 2020 lockdowns and the harsh circumstances of leaving the city should have put a stop to migration back to the city. But, as is well documented now, immediately after these lockdowns eased, there was a swift return of workers to urban India. Together with the fact that agricultural yields have been stagnant, this suggests that there was no pull factor in the agricultural sector that may have explained a rurally driven decline of poverty.

The structural composition of the Indian economy, hunger and deprivation, and the movement of migrant workers and alternative calculation of consumption per-person favour the narrative that the poor are not much better off at present than they were nearly a decade ago. Estimates which extrapolate, or use private sector data, argue that the decline was real and, to be frank, spectacular. Bibek Debroy, the chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India, has calculated the poverty headcount to be 18% in 2020-21 (using the PLFS). This is closer to our overall assessment that headcounts from a wide range of estimates puts India‚Äôs poverty at between 20-25% prior to the pandemic. In effect, not much appears to have changed over the last decade. Mark Twain apparently said, seeing his own obituary, that accounts of his death have been vastly exaggerated. Perhaps the same is true of Indian poverty.

During a media interaction at an event in New Delhi, the senior economic advisor of the ministry said, ""It goes to show that the aviation industry and the Indian economy are on the right trajectory.""

While speaking in terms of cargo business, he said there was a bit of lag. He said globally too, it was suffering. ""In Europe, there is a slowdown. In the US, there is no growth,"" he added.

For the cargo business, he said it now depends on the domestic cargo business since the international business is stagnant. Piyush Srivastava said, ""Domestic cargo business contributes one-third of the total business."" He said cargo business hasn't reached the pre-Covid level but it was slowly reaching the level.

Speaking on the lines of Go First case, he said, ""The Go First case has gone to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). So, we will wait for the outcome."" He also said, ""I will not like to comment on something that is already with the Tribunal.""

On the developments in Krishi Udan, he said, ""We had given concessions on the navigation charges, etc, to all the airport that we had taken in the Krishi Udan scheme. Now, we have opened 21 defence airports, so Krishi Udan's reach has expanded.""

Piyush Srivastava said, ‚ÄúIt depends on the industry to take advantage of this situation. The industry has to bring in the filters and get the benefit of the concessions available on offer.""

295,mint,India‚Äôs foreign trade policy offers an export roadmap,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/indias-foreign-trade-policy-offers-an-export-roadmap-11683046309455.html,02 May 2023,,"The country‚Äôs newly announced Foreign Trade Policy (FTP 2023), which took effect from 1 April this year, is a testament to the forward thinking and realistic approach of Indian policymakers. Launched with the aim of achieving a goal of $2 trillion in exports by the end of this decade, it charts a path for international trade as a significant part of India‚Äôs journey towards becoming a $5 trillion economy. The new policy has touched upon various aspects of foreign trade on the basis of developments that have happened over the last eight years. Under the new policy, special emphasis has been given to cross-border trade in digital spheres of economic activity and promoting the ease of doing business, as well as trade facilitation, with needs of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector kept especially in mind.

This policy is expected to have a significant impact on the country‚Äôs MSMEs, which are set to benefit from several measures aimed at promoting exports. Within the scope of the new trade policy, e-commerce exporters now enjoy all the benefits offered to other exporters by the FTP. Reduction in fees, inclusion of duty credit scrips, duty exemptions and remission schemes are some of the key provisions under the policy. These would be beneficial to small sellers and MSMEs, as they are aimed at making it easier and affordable for them to engage and operate in overseas markets.

In addition to that, even as the FTP 2023 aims to promote the ease of doing business, it encourages states and districts to address markets abroad and increase their export operations. These steps also make the FTP more dynamic and decentralized, which should create a more conducive ecosystem for the MSME sector to grow and integrate with global value chains.

Dak Ghar Niryat Kendras, which are post offices designated to facilitate exports by MSMEs, have been operationalized to work in tandem with Foreign Post Offices under the FTP 2023. This effort will help simplify logistics, facilitate the MSME sector‚Äôs cross-border e-commerce thrust and aid small businesses as they aim to reach potential customers in international markets. To further expand e-commerce exports under the scope of the FTP, the government will be setting up the information technology infrastructure needed to streamline such exports.

At present, the MSME sector faces several challenges in terms of exporting products and penetrating foreign markets. Among these, to name a few, are a lack of awareness about demand patterns in specific foreign markets and low acquaintance with market insights and incentive schemes, apart from relatively weak technology adoption and lack of access to affordable trade finance schemes.

To address these challenges, the government intends to conduct special outreach and training programmes aimed at Indian MSME exporters.

Another key measure introduced under the new foreign trade policy is the setting up of special e-commerce export hubs. These designated hubs will help e-commerce exporters in tackling various logistical costs and challenges, such as custom clearances, processing of returned goods and even warehousing. These special facilities will also allow for various last-mile activities, such as repackaging, labelling and testing, which will in turn reduce logistical costs for Indian exporters.

To promote this cause further, plans to sort out the challenges of inventory held for exports could also be incorporated in the trade policy, as this would help mitigate turnaround delays, apart from reducing logistical and warehousing costs, both of which are critical for Indian competitiveness in markets abroad . It would go well with the policy‚Äôs broad thrust of creating a more conducive environment in general for MSMEs to engage in international trade and help them compete more effectively in global markets.

The new trade policy announced by the Union commerce ministry has also doubled the value limit for exports undertaken through courier services from ‚Çπ5 lakh to ‚Çπ10 lakh per consignment. Even though this raised cap is a relief for certain sets of Indian exporters, setting a value limit in itself for such exports acts as a limiting factor for businesses which export high-value goods. The overall impact of these measures, however, is expected to be significant, with the policy aiming to increase India‚Äôs goods and services exports to $2 trillion by 2030. This is a significant target and will require a nuanced approach, where both exporters and sellers will have to work together smoothly.

Given that the e-commerce model that is prevalent in the country is the platform-as-marketplace model, provisions such as simplified payment reconciliation procedures for e-commerce exporters, distinguishing sellers-on-record from exporters-on-record to reduce the compliance burden on small sellers, will help the cause of reaching the country‚Äôs export target.

The dynamic nature of the policy, which can be revised as we go along, offers a great deal of flexibility and adaptability, enabling Indian policymakers to respond effectively to market shifts and the needs of sellers.

In conclusion, the FTP 2023 will help build India as an export hub by enabling and empowering the MSME sector significantly. The policy is expected to provide a significant boost to India‚Äôs exports and help the country work towards becoming a developed economy within a quarter century, as envisioned for Amrit Kaal.

296,mint,What to make of record GST collections in April,https://www.livemint.com/economy/does-april-gst-set-the-trend-for-the-full-year-11683046509947.html,03 May 2023,,"Goods and services tax (GST) collections hit a record ‚Çπ1.87 trillion in April. Ever since its introduction, GST data has become a barometer of how well the economy is performing. But is the April data really so straightforward? Mint explains:

What did the latest GST data show?

Every month, the finance ministry releases the monthly goods and services collection data, which is an indicator of economic activity in the country. On 1 May, the finance ministry said GST collections in April were ‚Çπ1.87 trillion, the highest since the implementation of the indirect tax regime in 2017. Soon after the release of the data, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a tweet lauded the collections, saying that it was ‚Äúgreat news for the Indian economy"". Of the total amount, Central GST was ‚Çπ38,440 crore, State GST ‚Çπ47,412 crore, integrated GST ‚Çπ89,158 crore and cess ‚Çπ12,025 crore.

How to read the record figures?

The April data is for transactions that took place in March, which usually benefit from high year-end economic activity and compliance-related measures. But this spike tends to be short-lived, and collections in the rest of the year tend to be sharply lower. In FY23, after hitting ‚Çπ1.68 trillion in April, the GST mop-up remained in the ‚Çπ1.4-1.5 trillion range, and was ‚Çπ1.6 trillion in March 2023. A better metric is year-on-year growth, and that doesn‚Äôt paint a rosy picture. At 11.6%, collections growth in April hit a 5-month low. This was also only a tad higher than the 10.5% nominal GDP growth projected by the government for FY24.

How have collections grown in the last two years?

They have been robust, rising as much as 30% in FY22 and 22% in FY23. But much of the rise was due to high inflation and a low base effect, given the drop during the pandemic. Nevertheless, the rise in collections outpaced nominal GDP growth. But this momentum is slowing down, and growth may even drop to single digits, economists said.

Will inflation impact GST collections?

GST collections are measured at current prices, which include the impact of inflation. The high growth rate in the past two years was attributed to high inflation, with retail prices rising 5.5% in FY22 and 6.8% in FY23 and wholesale prices rising 13% and 9.4%, respectively. However, in the current financial year, inflation is expected to slow down at the retail level and come off sharply at the wholesale level. This, in turn, could slow the momentum of GST collections, along with a slowdown in the overall economy.

What does this mean for the economy?

Higher mop-up, in theory, without any tax rejig, means higher consumption of goods and services. However, inflation and base effects have muddled a clear trend in the past three years even as collections have outpaced nominal GDP growth. With GST collections forming 28% of the Centre‚Äôs tax kitty (higher than corporate and income tax), its healthy growth is crucial. But many view GST as an undue burden on the poor, which could, in turn, impede consumption growth at lower income levels."
297,mint,Youthful Demographics: India's Economic Opportunities and Challenges,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/demography-is-not-destiny-but-it-does-shape-economic-outcomes-11683045962709.html,10 May 2023,,"The United Nations (UN) has said that India will overtake China as the world‚Äôs most populous country this year. The statement has naturally attracted a lot of public attention. There can be some debate on whether this demographic event will take place this year or not. India has not had a full census since 2011. All we have right now are estimates. The UN says that there will be 1.43 billion Indians by the middle of 2023. Indian government estimates are lower. The Technical Group on Population Projection of the Indian census office said in July 2020 that it expects a population of 1.39 billion in 2023‚Äîor 53 million less than the UN estimate. However, there is little doubt that India will inevitably overtake China on the population front. It is only a matter of time.

The UN report has reignited the old debate whether India can take advantage of its demographic advantage before its labour force peaks and the population begins to age. And especially whether India can catch up with China before the demographic window shuts in the coming decades, especially as that country moves into a slower lane because of factors ranging from a declining labour force, misallocation of capital and perhaps low productivity growth in case the West‚Äôs geopolitical thrust to deny it access to new technologies is not countered with domestic innovation. Meanwhile, a fact check: India is currently around 15 years behind China in terms of per capita income at market exchange rates. In other words, our current level of average income is what China had in 2007.

One useful starting point is to compare contemporary India with some other successful Asian economies when they were at a similar demographic juncture in earlier years. The one number considered here as a broad proxy for the demographic structure in a country is the median age of its population‚Äîor the age of the person in the middle in case every citizen is lined up in either ascending or descending order of age. India right now has a median age of around 28 years. Many other Asian peers had a similar median age earlier, from Japan in 1970 to Malaysia in 2017 (see chart). This is broadly the point when most of these countries were in the midst of extraordinary economic booms. Not everything can be ascribed to demographics. For example, China had a median age of 28 in 1999, and the subsequent economic acceleration also coincided with its entry to the World Trade Organization.

Economists usually account for economic growth in terms of its three main drivers: the size of the labour force, the investment rate and productivity growth. A country whose people are mostly of working age tends to have higher domestic savings and investments, since the number of dependents per working person is relatively low. There are some nuances to be considered. For example, the quality of the labour force in terms of education, health and skills also matters. The usual thumb-rule is that countries in their early stages of development tend to drive economic growth using more inputs; typically, they have a higher investment rate as well as an increasing labour force. Productivity tends to play a more important role in the later stages of development.

The data shows how India and six other successful Asian economies fare in terms of average income, the investment rate and labour force participation when their median age was 28. The numbers tell an interesting story. First, each country had a very different level of per capita income when its median age was 28. That also partly reflects initial conditions in the year they had a similar age structure as India‚Äôs today. Second, the investment rate in each of these countries at that point of time was broadly in the same range, between 25% to 40% of gross domestic product. Vietnam and Malaysia are on the lower side, Japan was at the higher end, while China maintained a very high investment rate in the two decades after 1999.

The big difference between India and the other six countries is in the labour force participation data, or how many people of working age are in the labour force. India‚Äôs labour force participation rate is much lower than what the others reported at that time, and this gap ranges from 15 to 32 percentage points. Much of this wide gap is explained by very low levels of female participation in the labour force, as the table here shows.

The upshot: India has been unable to productively employ its young population, especially females. The result is that Indian economic growth in recent years has been largely powered by the more intensive use of capital as well as productivity growth. Many recent statistical studies have highlighted the same structure. One way to boost potential growth is to create the conditions for higher employment, something that India has been struggling with in recent decades, even though the claims of ‚Äújobless growth"" may be exaggerated.

Having the world‚Äôs largest population is an advantage only if there are enough jobs to convert a demographic fact into an economic opportunity.
