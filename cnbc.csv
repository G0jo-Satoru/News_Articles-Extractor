Mitul Kotecha, Head of FX and EM Macro Strategy Asia at Barclays, in an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18, provided his insights on this dynamic landscape.

Kotecha anticipates that the dollar will maintain its strength in the coming months, particularly into the first quarter. However, he expects a moderation in the dollar's performance later next year. This shift could pressure emerging markets and Asian currencies, including the Indian rupee , which is currently rangebound but may weaken in the next year, potentially reaching around 83.8 against the dollar.

""Our view is that ultimately the rupee could see a weaker footing as we go into the next year potentially around 83.8 before we see some downward move in dollar rupee,"" he explained.

The rupee demonstrated resilience in morning trade on Wednesday, November 15, appreciating 32 paise to 83.01 against the US dollar. This rise followed the US dollar's retreat from its high levels after US inflation data came in lower than expected. Forex traders noted that the rupee's bullish start was due to the weakening of the US dollar post the inflation data, reaching its highest level in nearly two months.

On November 13, the rupee touched an all-time low of 83.33 against the dollar.

Amit Pabari, MD of CR Forex Advisors, observed that the rupee is currently trading at nearly a two-month high around 83.00 levels. He cautioned that a breach below 82.95 could lead to further downside, with levels of 82.80 and 82.50 becoming crucial in the sessions to come.

In the broader economic context, the dollar index showed a marginal uptick of 0.02% to 104.07, following a recent high of 105.77 on Monday (November 13).

As global economic dynamics continue to evolve, the currency markets remain sensitive to key indicators, with the dollar's strength and the rupee's performance drawing attention from investors and analysts alike. The coming weeks are likely to witness fluctuations in these currencies, influenced by factors such as inflation trends, oil prices, and broader market sentiments.

Samiran Chakraborty, Chief India Economist at Citibank, indicated that inflation in India could hover within the range of 5.6-5.9%.

“There is not really a big respite over the next two months. We think that the next two prints could be in the range of 5.6% to 5.9% -- pretty close to the 6% mark and that is why it is difficult for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to immediately move into some sort of an easing mindset -- probably wait for a more sustained drop towards 4% mark, observe that and then only consider some easing which we think is not before the middle of next year,” he said.

As inflation remains a critical factor influencing economic decisions, the forecasted range offers a glimpse into the challenges and opportunities that may shape India's economic landscape in the coming months.

He made this reference at the 20th edition of FICCI’s flagship annual Capital Markets Conference — CAPAM 2023.

He added that while there are 12 parent banks in the PSB segment, the public sector insurance sector has seven parent companies. Pandey went on to add that the country has 389 central public sector enterprises (CPSEs), of which 58 are listed, with a market capitalisation of $280 billion.

Seventeen PSUs have been listed since 2017.

As per Pandey, the disinvestment policy is widely misunderstood and therefore needs to be seen in a wider perspective.

""If an enterprise is healthy and kicking, and its wealth is shared through minority stake, that’s disinvestment too, while the government holds majority stake, which is an investment of taxpayer money,"" he said

""Disinvestment and dividend are contrarian in nature but fiscally need to be put together and see money coming in,"" he added.

Pandey has long reiterated that his department strikes a fine balance between disinvestment strategy and a consistent dividend policy. ""DIPAM handles both disinvestment as well as dividend. In many cases, they are interlinked, and the government is dependent on both for fiscal receipts,"" he said at an interview to Business Today earlier.

""If we look at our disinvestment policy, it has got two pillars. The first pillar of disinvestment is minority stake sale, which includes IPO, FPO, OFS and buybacks. In an IPO, we take an unlisted company to the market with the intent to not only raise receipts but also to improve corporate governance and accountability. The other pillar, which was opened in 2016 after a long period, is privatisation, which is a much deeper reform. From 2014, we have got about ₹4.17 lakh crore in a matter of nine years as disinvestment receipts,"" he added."

Typically, before a general election, the Centre presents the Survey only when the full annual financial statement is tabled around June-July.

Share Market Live NSE

“This won’t be a full-fledged Economic Survey , but it will be a short document, similar to a survey. It will not be seen as big as what will be presented around June-July, but it will likely include the key indicators and forecasts such as GDP growth, nominal GDP growth target, oil prices, among others, but it won’t be a deep dive on the economy,” the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Moneycontrol.

The ministry is currently discussing ways to package this document articulating India’s economic performance in 2023-24, the official added.

According to this official, the ministry is yet to decide “how to package the document, but since we keep working all year around, we can take a call on how to package it later before presenting it in January. Once we take a view, we can quickly package it.”

The Economic Survey, which is tabled every year a day before the full Union Budget, is typically presented on January 31 of each year. The flagship report is prepared by the Economics Division of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) under the guidance of the Chief Economic Advisers (CEA), who is currently V Anantha Nageswaran. The survey is considered to be a report card of the economy and is used by CEAs to articulate key reform ideas.

The Economic Survey that usually contains two volumes had in 2022 reverted to a single volume as the earlier format was way too “unwieldy”, the then Principal Economic Advisor Sanjeev Sanyal had said on January 31, 2022.

The Survey for 2023 projected real GDP growth for the current fiscal in the range of 6-6.8 percent, ""depending on the trajectory of economic and political developments globally""."

According to an official notification, the Special Additional Excise Duty or SAED, has been reduced to ₹ 6,300 per tonne from ₹ 9,800 per tonne.

Share Market Live NSE

SAED levied on the export of diesel was halved to ₹ 1 per litre from ₹ 2 per litre. Tax on jet fuel or Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) remained nil. SAED on export of petrol also continues to be zero.

The new tax rates will come into effect from today, i.e. November 16. India first introduced windfall profit taxes in July 2022. At that time, export duties of ₹ 6 per litre each were levied on petrol and ATF and ₹ 13 per litre on diesel.

A windfall tax is levied on domestic crude oil if rates of the global benchmark rise above $75 per barrel. Export of diesel, ATF and petrol attract the levy if product cracks (or margins) — the difference between crude oil (raw material) and finished petroleum products — rise above $20 per barrel.

5,CNBC,US Senate votes overwhelmingly to avert US government shutdown,https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/us-senate-passes-stopgap-to-prevent-shutdown-sends-president-joe-biden-sign-18335421.htm,"Nov 16, 2023 10:11 AM","The US Senate overwhelmingly approved a temporary funding measure to avert a government shutdown, delaying a partisan clash over federal spending until the new year and leaving out emergency aid to allies Ukraine and Israel.

The 87-11 vote late Wednesday night sends the measure, already passed by the House, to President Joe Biden. He is expected to sign it before the shutdown deadline late Friday night.

The outcome provides a temporary reprieve from a bitter ideological struggle over spending that already this year has brought the US close to a debt default, provoked Fitch Ratings to downgrade the nation’s sovereign credit rating, and cost former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy his job.

The measure “accomplishes two things that I and other Democrats have been insistent on for weeks: it will avoid a government shutdown, and it will do so without any of the cruel cuts or poison pills that the hard right pushed for,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor.

The new House speaker, Mike Johnson, who proposed the interim funding package, faces scathing criticism just three weeks into the job from some hardline conservatives because he didn’t meet their demands for immediate deep spending cuts or changes to immigration policies. Ninety-three House Republicans voted against their leader on the measure.

Tempers flared in the Capitol as the stopgap bill progressed, with one hardline conservative making an accusation of bullying on Tuesday after McCarthy bumped into him in a crowded hallway.

Illustrating the stakes of the turmoil, Moody’s Investors Service on Friday lowered the US’s credit-rating outlook to negative from stable. Moody’s cited increasing risks to the country’s fiscal strength and specifically pointed to political polarization in Congress.

The short-term funding bill that the Senate approved allows both parties to regroup over the Thanksgiving holiday while talks continue on a border security compromise and broader spending deals.

The measure funds some parts of the government through Jan. 19 and others through Feb. 2. Johnson said this week this is the last time he would support a short-term funding measure.

The risk of a partial government shutdown in January is heightened because the agencies singled out in the first funding lapse wouldn’t trigger some of the most politically sensitive consequences, such as cutting off pay for military personnel and closing national parks. Those agencies would not lose funding until February.

At the same time, divisions among Republicans have repeatedly stymied efforts to pass the 12 full-year spending measures that ordinarily fund the government and were due Oct. 1. House Republicans on Wednesday again failed to agree on one of those annual measures, for federal law enforcement agencies, causing Johnson to send lawmakers home early for the holiday recess.

Ukraine Outlook

The White House has requested more than $61 billion in additional assistance for Ukraine as part of a nearly $106 billion overall package that also includes funding for Israel, operations on the US-Mexico border and aid for Taiwan.

Hardliners are against fresh Ukraine aid. Johnson opposed the first tranche of Ukraine war aid in May 2022 but has said he now sees the assistance as a priority.

However, Johnson and many Republican senators are insisting on tying money for Ukraine to Republican demands on border security. Such immigration changes, including making it harder for migrants to seek asylum in the US, will be difficult to negotiate between the parties, though bipartisan talks are underway in the Senate.

Schumer said Wednesday that Democrats would negotiate on the border in good faith in the coming weeks, but insisted a compromise would have to be reached with both parties giving something.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, however, said Democrats didn’t yet seem willing to make the kinds of policy changes needed to slow the flow of migrants into the country."
6,CNBC,JPMorgan has a new way to gauge its green progress,https://www.cnbctv18.com/environment/jpmorgan-has-a-new-way-to-gauge-its-green-progress-18334761.htm,"Nov 16, 2023 7:47 AM","The world’s leading fossil fuel financier has come up with a new way to assess how well it’s supporting a low-carbon transition.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is changing how it calculates greenhouse gas emissions that flow from the funding it provides oil and gas companies. The Wall Street giant run by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said it’s adding its financing of zero-carbon power generation to the calculus.

“A singular focus on fossil fuels won’t successfully achieve the necessary transition of the global energy system,” the bank wrote in its annual climate report. “Supporting the rapid build-out of zero-carbon power” will “help replace fossil fuels and reduce emissions.”

As the largest energy banker, JPMorgan is a frequent target of criticism over Wall Street’s role in the climate crisis. At the same time, the bank is a leading US arranger of green bonds, making it vulnerable to Republicans seeking to protect the fossil fuel industry.

The bank has said it doesn’t seek to play favorites with either side of the climate aisle. The energy transition requires $4 trillion of annual investment, Dimon said in the report, which brings with it “the potential to generate a wave of growth and opportunity the world hasn’t seen since the first industrial revolution.”

On Wednesday, JPMorgan said its oil and gas clients’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions—much of which stems from methane leaks and flaring—will stand apart from their Scope 3 emissions, or end-use of client products. Scope 3 emissions account for as much as 95% of the total carbon emissions from oil and gas companies, according to a recent report from Wood Mackenzie.

Under JPMorgan’s new plan for calculating its green progress, financed Scope 3 emissions will be combined with the “zero-carbon power generation activity” it also funds, such as solar, wind and hydropower as well as nuclear. The bank is calling this an “energy mix target,” saying that its new goal is to reduce carbon intensity of its energy-mix financing portfolio by 36% (using a 2019 baseline) by 2030. The energy mix target, the bank said, is intended to “reflect the reality that we also need to prioritize a significant build-out of clean energy sources.”

Like most of its peers, JPMorgan has set interim decarbonization targets for the most carbon-intensive areas of its balance sheet, including oil and gas. While loans to fossil fuel companies make up just 3% of JPMorgan’s $1.15 trillion lending portfolio, Scope 3 emissions from those companies are by far the biggest contributor to the bank’s financed emissions, generating five times more greenhouse gas pollution than the next heaviest-emitting sector.

BloombergNEF has warned that by 2030, banks must be lending four times as much to clean-energy concerns as they do to fossil fuel companies if the planet is to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. With six years to go, the average ratio is currently closer to 1-to-1. JPMorgan came in at 0.7 as of 2021.

“The expectation that the financial services sector is going to solve the climate crisis on its own is a little out of step with reality,” said Heather Zichal, the bank’s global head of sustainability. “As much as we might provide financing to the oil and gas sector, we also are a huge force in green finance.”

Ramaswamy Variankaval, JPMorgan’s global head of corporate advisory and sustainable solutions, said the bank’s new methodology “aligns us better with both the underlying scenario and also the on-the-ground reality.” In practice, it means the bank could record a decrease in its financed emissions target without cutting back on the amount of money it funnels to the oil and gas industry, though Variankaval said he expects that—as the bank provides more capital to clean energy projects—it will ultimately “substitute the higher carbon intensity sources of energy.”

A spokesperson for the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions said “the key is to invest in the clean technologies without increasing investment in traditional fossil fuels. You want the denominator to include a growing amount of clean energy and a shrinking amount of fossil fuels—and that shift needs to be transparent over several years.”

JPMorgan also disclosed several other updates in its climate report, including decarbonization goals for two new sectors: shipping and aluminum. The bank now has net-zero financing goals for eight of the most-pollutive industries.

The New York-based bank said all of its new and existing targets will be aligned with the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario. Earlier goals were set to the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario, which aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2070.

JPMorgan also published absolute financed-emissions numbers for the first time. The bank focuses on measuring carbon intensity, or the amount of carbon produced per unit of output. Critics have said using intensity targets alone can be problematic, as emissions intensity can decrease even as a bank’s absolute emissions increase.

Zichal said intensity measurements remain “the most decision-useful metric” and that adding absolute numbers allows JPMorgan to provide stakeholders with “an additional layer of transparency.”

The bank published absolute emissions in line with the methodology recommended by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), a widely used industry standard. It also offered numbers using its own process that the bank says seeks to avoid volatility that has skewed emissions data for other banks that use the PCAF framework. JPMorgan’s PCAF-based absolute financed emissions for its energy mix portfolio, which includes oil and gas sector Scope 3, totals 35.6 million tons of CO2 equivalent, while under its own methodology the number is more than three times bigger at 128.3 million tons at the end of last year.

Unlike PCAF, JPMorgan’s own calculations use a three-year average for company value and a 12-month monthly average for committed financing. The bank also counts the entirety of revolving credit facilities, whether they’ve been drawn down or not.

“JPMorgan has committed that capital, so the client can draw anytime they want to,” Variankaval said. “So we think it would be inaccurate not to include it in our absolute financed emissions calculations.”

A group of banks assembled by PCAF to devise the first industry standards for calculating the carbon footprints of capital-markets activities have struggled to agree on the best approach. JPMorgan calculated the emissions from its capital markets activities and includes 100% of its share in bond underwritings. In 2022, the bank recorded 51.2 million tons of CO2e from its capital markets financing for oil and gas."

The team visited Islamabad to hold discussions on the first review of Pakistan’s economic program supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).

“The IMF team has reached a staff-level agreement (SLA) with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of their stabilization program supported by the IMF’s US$3 billion (SDR2,250 million) SBA. The agreement is subject to approval of the IMF’s Executive Board. Upon approval around US$700 million (SDR 528 million) will become available bringing total disbursements under the program to almost US$1.9 billion,"" it said in a press release.

Earlier, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said she expects a deal on a debt review with Pakistan to come soon, a development that could unlock more funds for the South Asian nation.

“I expect an agreement of the review to come within this week,” Georgieva told Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin in an interview in Singapore on Wednesday. The Pakistani authorities, especially the finance minister “deserve credit for a very difficult time sticking to the program that they have,” she said.

An IMF team is currently in Pakistan for a scheduled review of its loan agreement signed in July , ahead of the release of an instalment of about $700 million. Reaching a deal on the review would improve Pakistan’s access to other credit.

In a wide-ranging interview, Georgieva painted a bleak picture of economic hardship across the world, spurred by higher interest rates, a failure to fully recover from the pandemic and conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. She warned that if the Israel-Hamas war persists, it could have “dramatic consequences.”

Georgieva said the economies of Gaza, the West Bank and Israel have been devastated. She pointed out that 8% of Israel’s labour force is now in the army while tourism in neighbouring countries such as Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan has drastically dropped.

“The world is on edge,” she said. “If there is an impact on oil prices, what we did in fighting inflation is going to be partially lost and that can be a big problem.”

The fund last month lifted its global inflation forecast for next year to almost 6% and called for central banks to keep policy tight until there’s a durable easing in price pressures.

“At this point, we are not projecting recession. However, we are in a world of exceptional uncertainty,” Georgieva added. “Anything we can do to bring this uncertainty down is going to be healthy for the world economy.”

Georgieva said she isn’t worried about a global debt crisis but reiterated that low- and middle-income countries were vulnerable to rising borrowing costs.

Share Market Live NSE

The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices in the year to October were 4.6% higher than the year before, much lower than the 6.7% recorded in the previous month.

The decline means Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's pledge to halve inflation this year has been met. Sunak made the pledge soon after becoming prime minister when inflation was more than 10%.

“I did that because it is, without a doubt, the best way to ease the cost of living and give families financial security,” he said. ""Today, we have delivered on that pledge.”

Meeting the pledge — one of five set out by Sunak on taking office — will provide some comfort to his Conservative government, which is trailing the main opposition Labour Party in opinion polls ahead of a general election that has to take place by January 2025.

Labour's economic spokesperson Rachel Reeves said the government should not be “popping champagne corks” while people are still struggling with the cost of living.

“After 13 years of economic failure under the Conservatives, working people are worse off with higher mortgage bills, prices still rising in the shops and inflation twice as high as the Bank of England’s target,” she said.

Though the government has a role in containing inflation by, for example, keeping a lid on public sector pay awards, the main reason why inflation has fallen is due to actions by the Bank of England, which is tasked with meeting a target inflation rate of 2%.

Earlier this month, the bank kept its main interest rate unchanged at the 15-year high of 5.25% and indicated that borrowing costs will likely remain at these sort of elevated levels for a while.

The Bank of England, like other central banks, raised interest rates aggressively from near zero as it sought to counter price rises first stoked by supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy costs.

Higher interest rates — which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow, thereby bearing down on spending — have contributed to bringing down inflation worldwide.

Economists said the decline means that the bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee is very unlikely to be increasing interest rates again in the near future. They also think that if inflation continues to fall towards 2%, then one or more of the nine-member panel may start mulling reductions in borrowing rates soon.

“This fall in inflation seals the deal on a December interest rate hold and may drive a three-way voting split among rate setters with a member voting for a rate cut as concerns over a flatlining economy grow,"" said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales."

Share Market Live NSE

He anticipates a decline in the US 10-year bond yield to 4.2% by the second quarter of 2025 and at 3.95% by the end of next year.

Ahya remains optimistic about India's growth trajectory, projecting a robust 6.4% growth next year. This forecast positions India as a major contributor to global growth, accounting for an impressive 17% in the financial year 2024. Such a significant contribution underscores India's growing influence on the world stage.

“India will still continue to be the best domestic demand alpha opportunity within the region and we are expecting growth to be at 6.4% next year, in the 2024 calendar year,” he said.

The export sector in India is also expected to see a modestly positive trend moving forward. However, Ahya pointed out that the real driving force behind India's growth story is its strong domestic demand, which is likely to continue fueling the economy.

“India's story has been driven by more domestic demand and that story still continues and there is nothing that should hold back India’s growth rate,” he said.

Share Market Live NSE

According to a CNBC-TV18 poll of economists, the CPI forecast was at 4.8%. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) factors in the CPI data while making its bi-monthly monetary policy.

The street is divided on how the latest drop in retail inflation may affect the RBI's stance. While Bank of America Securities continues to expect another rate hike from the RBI, UBS expects rates to remain unchanged. On the other hand, CLSA believes that the odds of a rate cut have risen with the latest data.

It is important to note that the RBI's target for retail inflation is 4%, and even after the recent cool-off, the price is still well above the central bank's comfort level. Governor Shaktikanta Das had recently emphasised that the monetary policy panel is committed to bringing it down to that level.

The previous low in inflation was recorded in June when it came in at 4.87%. The RBI Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), in its October meeting, projected CPI inflation at 5.4% for 2023-24, a moderation from 6.7% in 2022-23.

As per the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), the inflation in the food basket was 6.61%, marginally down from 6.62% in September and 7% in the year-ago month. The inflation in the 'oil and fat' segment declined by 13.73%, while it remained subdued in the case of vegetables, meat and fish, and 'light and fuel'.

Among states, the inflation was above 6% in Odisha, Rajasthan and Haryana. Inflation in states like Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab ruled above the national average of 4.87%. The lowest inflation was witnessed in Chhattisgarh and Delhi. On a national level, the retail inflation was 5.12% in rural areas and 4.62% in urban India.

The government has tasked the RBI to ensure the CPI inflation remains at 4% with a margin of 2% on either side. The central bank mainly factors in the retail inflation while arriving at its bi-monthly monetary policy.

Sujan Hajra, chief economist and executive director of Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said the retail inflation rate for October 2023 was both lower than the level recorded in September 2023 and higher than our initial expectations.

""Yet, since the monthly inflation figures are notoriously volatile, this ought not to elicit apprehension. As the overarching pattern of declining inflation persists, the central bank would find solace in an inflation rate that has now fallen below 5%,"" Hajra said.

""As a result of declining inflation and ongoing economic resilience, the Reserve Bank of India will maintain the halt stance for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that inflation will fluctuate between 4% and 5% over the next twelve months. We therefore see little likelihood of any rate action occurring within this time frame,"" Hajra added.

The price data are collected from 1,114 urban markets and 1,181 villages, covering all states and UTs through personal visits by field staff of the operations division of the National Statistical Office, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (NSO, MoSPI) on a weekly roster.

Share Market Live NSE

Retail sales climbed 7.6% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday, better than estimates — though it compared to a particularly weak month in 2022 when spending contracted amid pandemic restrictions and outbreaks. Industrial production rose 4.6% from a year earlier, higher than the consensus forecast of a 4.5% increase.

Growth in fixed-asset investment slowed to 2.9% in the first 10 months of the year, weaker than the 3.1% forecast by economists. Property investment dropped 9.3% year-to-date, worsening from the period through September. The urban jobless rate was unchanged at 5%.

While the economy outperformed expectations in the July-to-September period, recent indicators have pointed to weakening momentum and demand as the final quarter kicked off. Official and private surveys showed factory activity contracting and growth in services moderating. A drop in exports worsened, consumer prices dipped back into deflation and borrowing by households and companies was muted.

Policymakers are taking steps to add stimulus to help the economy, including via an unconventional mid-year budget revision and the approval of 1 trillion yuan worth of sovereign bonds for infrastructure investment last month. The People’s Bank of China injected the most cash since 2016 through its medium-term lending facility on Wednesday to support funding for growth.

Beijing is also planning to provide at least 1 trillion yuan ($137 billion) of low-cost financing to the nation’s urban village renovation and affordable housing programs to help the property market, Bloomberg News reported.

Share Market Live NSE

Gross domestic product contracted at an annualized pace of 2.1% in the third quarter, largely on the back of falling business spending and higher imports that dragged on the economy, the Cabinet Office reported Wednesday. The contraction was deeper than economists’ estimate of a 0.4% shrinkage.

Wednesday’s data suggest that Japan’s economic recovery remains patchy, lagging behind its global peers. The lackluster economy may give the Bank of Japan a reason to delay any policy shift away from its massive monetary easing stance.

BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has maintained that the bank will stand pat until there are clearer signs that a virtuous cycle of wages, prices and growth is strengthening. Still, Ueda also recently hinted that Japan is making progress toward its 2% stable inflation target, a prerequisite for policy normalization, fueling speculation over a possible early shift.

The world’s third-largest economy also contracted 0.5% in the third quarter from the previous quarter, after expanding 1.2% in the second quarter from the first. This was also a larger contraction than expectations for 0.1% contraction.

“The biggest drag on activity came from stock building, which subtracted 0.3%-pts from GDP growth last quarter. Even so, it’s worth noting that there was a concurrent, broad-based decline in private demand,” said Marcel Thieliant, Capital Economics’ head of Asia-Pacific coverage.

The weaker GDP print was partly driven by weaker than expected domestic capital expenditure, which contracted 0.6% in the third quarter from the second quarter — as opposed to expectations for a 0.3% expansion, according to the same government release.

Private consumption in Japan was flat in the third quarter from the previous quarter, as domestic and foreign demand weighed on the economy.

“With real household incomes set to fall at least until the middle of next year, that bodes ill for consumer spending, which we expect to grind to a standstill next year,” Thieliant added.

Commercial and retail bankers at regional banks will receive bonuses that are 10% to 20% lower than the previous year, the report showed.

""Most Wall Street professionals will have to wait another year for a rebound,” said consultant Alan Johnson. ""With the financial markets and overall economy struggling to find footing throughout the year, most business segments remain under pressure to keep compensation costs down.”

But there are some exceptions. Investment bankers working in equity underwriting are projected to receive payouts that are 5% to 15% higher than last year, while wealth managers could receive awards that are 5% higher. Retail or commercial bankers working in large institutions could see year-end bonuses stay flat or rise about 10%.

The only bright spot is that global sales of electric passenger vehicles are now on track to match what's needed along with many other changes to limit future warming to just another couple tenths of a degree, according to the State of Climate Action report released on Tuesday by the World Resources Institute, Climate Action Tracker, the Bezos Earth Fund and others.

On the flip side, public money spent to create more fossil fuel use is going in the wrong direction and faster than it has in the past, said study co-author Kelly Levin, science and data director at the Bezos Earth Fund.

This is not the time for tinkering around the edges, but it's instead the time for radical decarbonisation of all sectors of the economy, Levin said.

We are woefully off track and we are seeing the impact of inaction unfold around the world from extensive wildfire fires in Canada, heat-related deaths across the Mediterranean, record high temperatures in South Asia and so on,"" she said.

Later this month, crucial international climate negotiations start in Dubai that include the first time world negotiators will do a global stocktake on how close society is to meeting its 2015 climate goals.

In advance of the United Nations summit, numerous reports from experts are coming out assessing Earth's progress or mostly the lack of it, including a United States national assessment with hundreds of indicators. Tuesday's 42 indicators offers one of the grimmest report cards, detailing multiple failures of society.

The report looks at what's needed in several sectors of the global economy power, transportation, buildings, industry, finance and forestry to fit in a world that limits warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times, the goal the world adopted at Paris in 2015.

The globe has already warmed about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid-19th century.

Six categories the carbon intensity of global steel production, how many miles passenger cars drive, electric buses sold, loss of mangrove forests, amount of food waste and public financing of fossil fuel use are going in the wrong direction, the report said.

Fossil fuel consumption subsidies in particular reached an all-time high last year, over USD 1 trillion, driven by the war in Ukraine and the resulting energy price spikes, said report co-author Joe Thwaites of the Natural Resources Defence Council environmental group.

Another six categories were considered off track but going in the right direction, which is the closest to being on track and better than the 24 measurements that are well off track.

Those merely off track include zero-carbon electricity generation, electric vehicles as percentage of the fleet, two- and three-wheel electric vehicle sales, grazing animal meat production, reforestation and share of greenhouse gas emissions with mandatory corporate climate risk reporting requirements.

People should be worried that this report is one of ""too little, too late, said Arizona State University climate scientist Katharine Jacobs, who wasn't part of the report but praised it for being so comprehensive.

I am not shocked that at a global scale, we are not meeting expectations for reducing emissions, Jacobs said in an email.

We cannot ignore the fact that global commitments to (greenhouse gas) reductions are essentially unenforceable and that a number of major setbacks have taken a toll on our progress.

When trying to change an economy, the key is to start with low-hanging fruit, i.e., the sectors of the economy that are easiest to transition and give a big bang for your buck, said Dartmouth climate scientist Justin Mankin, who isn't part of the report. But he said the report shows we're really struggling to pick the low-hanging fruit."

Englander noted that the market has already absorbed downgrades from other agencies, suggesting that Moody's downgrade may not significantly impact the US market.

17,CNBC,Zoomed Out | How to empower India's social sector by unleashing the potential of NGOs,https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/oecd-better-life-index-india-social-sector-unleashing-the-potential-of-ngos-csos-18320421.htm,"Nov 14, 2023 8:52 AM","India, as a nation, has always been progressive, in constant pursuit of achieving a better tomorrow for all its citizens. The social sector, driven by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society organisations (CSOs), has been playing a vital role in this transformative journey by serving as a catalyst for inclusive development in all communities.

Share Market Live NSE

This sector has been working tirelessly to uplift the marginalised and vulnerable communities of the country that often get left behind. NGOs have proven to be instrumental in addressing the diverse challenges faced by India from time to time and driving a positive social impact.

NGOs operate across various sectors, including agriculture, gender, education, healthcare, and climate change, among others, and contribute to the overall well-being of the nation. India, with its vast population, varied cultures, and complex socio-economic landscape, greatly relies on NGOs to bridge gaps, uplift marginalised communities, and foster holistic development.

Why NGOs

These organisations are uniquely positioned to reach the most vulnerable groups, as they have the experience and knowledge to do so even when formal institutions cannot. They also have a deep understanding of local best practices and models, which makes them well-equipped to implement effective solutions.

The social sector has always played an imperative role in the development of the state. NGOs play a crucial role in advocating for the rights of vulnerable groups, including women, children, the elderly, and disadvantaged communities. NGOs have been helping implement grassroots initiatives and ensuring that the needs of local communities are met, and their voices are heard. India has set several targets for social development in sectors including public health, poverty alleviation, and education.

The OECD Better Life Index emphasises inclusion as a crucial indicator of a country's overall growth and prosperity. It underscores that a nation's success goes beyond economic metrics and should encompass factors like social cohesion, equal opportunities, and reduced inequality.

The index acknowledges that societies fostering inclusivity tend to experience higher well-being, improved quality of life, and sustainable development, reflecting a holistic approach to measuring a country's advancement. CSOs, working in the social sector, have joined forces with the government to ensure the upliftment of the marginalised sections of society and build the country from the grassroots upward.

A collaborative strategy involving crucial stakeholders within the social sector ecosystem would be appropriate to consider. Leveraging the knowledge and influence of various stakeholders can facilitate the provision of financial support and technical knowledge to enhance the capabilities of CSOs.

For instance, The GROW Fund by EdelGive Foundation brought multiple funder organisations together to support 100 NGOs from all over India, working in different domains such as climate, animal welfare, education, gender rights, health, and poverty. Through a collaborative approach, The GROW Fund delivered training sessions around capacity building, thereby helping the NGOs identify their areas of improvement and take the necessary steps to act on them.

Efficiency and outcome

Enhancing the capacity of NGOs enables them to work more efficiently and effectively on the ground. With improved skills, resources, and infrastructure, NGOs can implement innovative solutions, mobilise communities, and deliver targeted interventions. This, in turn, translates into tangible outcomes such as improved healthcare, education, livelihood opportunities, and social inclusion. Supporting the capacity building of NGOs holds immense potential for the entire nation, accelerating the achievement of socio-development goals and fostering a more equitable and participatory society.

There is an urgency to create a sustainable flow of funds for NGOs to ensure a conducive environment for their overall growth and development and to understand how the social sector landscape is transforming with respect to fostering relevant partnerships in the ecosystem.

As the Indian philanthropic sector is witnessing a significant transformation, NGOs in India need to manage their own well-being so they can improve their human resources, finances, communications, and information technology operations to ensure their own sustainability. An appropriate management strategy in the philanthropy sector could be a game-changer, and there is a pressing need to realise its significance and leverage its potential.

As we embark on the path to elevating India to unprecedented heights, it becomes paramount to invest in the growth and capabilities of NGOs to unlock our country’s full potential. By harnessing the collective strength of the public, private, and social sectors, we have the potential to propel India into a new era of transformation, solidifying our nation's standing as a formidable force.

Singh stated that India requires an additional 80,000 megawatts, equivalent to 80 gigawatts, of thermal power capacity to address the escalating power needs.

Providing context, India presently boasts a total power capacity of 425 gigawatts, with over 50% derived from thermal sources contributing approximately 239 gigawatts. The Power Minister aims to augment this by adding 80 gigawatts to the existing 239 gigawatts.

This 80 gigawatts signifies the total thermal power capacity that needs to be developed. Presently, there are 14 projects under construction nationwide, contributing to a thermal capacity of about 30 gigawatts.

However, a Central Electricity Authority (CEA) report from the end of September reveals that 27 thermal power projects, with a collective capacity of about 24 gigawatts, are currently on hold. Among these, two are state projects, and the remaining 25 belong to private entities, their future uncertain as they seek funding options.

Encouragingly, seven of the private projects, including two from Vedanta and one by Jindal Power & Steel , have devised successful revival plans and are expected to come to fruition within the next 2-3 years.

Although Sri Lanka has managed to control its hyperinflation in the ongoing economic crisis , its economy is far from being fully recovered.

""We have been able to put back on the rails the derailed economy. Still, people undergo suffering,"" Wickremesinghe, who is also the Finance Minister, said. The inflation which was 70% in September 2022 has been reduced to 1.5% in October this year,"" the minister said.

He said in order for the island nation to prevent another bankruptcy, hard reforms are a must. The state banks were made to fund the losses of state enterprises. He proposed that two state banks’ shares be issued to the public and investors while the government would inject cash into the state banks to maintain their stability.

Wickremesinghe said the cost of living allowances for 1.3 million state employees and pensioners numbering 700,000 would be raised by ₹10,000 and ₹3,000 respectively from 2024. The announcement came as state employees last week held street protests demanding a ₹20,000 wage hike.

He said the government could no longer print money or get external borrowings for state expenditure. Wickremesinghe blamed the political trade union for protests against investment projects such as the Trincomalee oil tanks farm development with India.

A special presidential task force would see the development of the entire Trincomalee district with the Indian side, he said. Highlighting the revenue shortfall, Wickremesinghe said there remains a monthly state expenditure deficit of rupees 168 billion with the government having to pay 220 billion as loan interest.

The revenue shortfall was one of the key factors mentioned in the International Monetary Fund’s first review of its 2.9 billion dollar bailout. The budget speech made no reference to when the second tranche of the IMF four-year bailout would be forthcoming.

Wickremesinghe said this budget was not a 2024 election budget as no popular handouts were announced. The next presidential election must be called by mid-September of 2024 and be held before the end of November."

In Q1 (April-June), 57% of respondents reported increased production levels, which gained further traction in Q2 (July-September) with over 79% noting higher production. Order books also reflect this positive trend, with 80% of respondents reporting increased orders, indicating optimistic demand conditions.

Speaking on the survey, Subhrakant Panda, President of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), pointed to a discernible uptick in manufacturing output in India, emphasising a shift towards increased positivity within the sector.

Panda noted that the average capacity utilisation has risen to around 74%, with notable contributions from sectors such as paper and miscellaneous manufacturing. He pointed out that even in sectors facing challenges, like chemicals and capital goods, the utilisation rates remain relatively high at 77%.

While acknowledging the overall positive sentiment, Panda raised concerns about geopolitical uncertainties affecting manufacturing plans. Factors like the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the ongoing situation in the Middle East have prompted some companies to reassess their strategies due to heightened uncertainty.

Harsh Pati Singhania, Vice President and Managing Director of JK Paper, shed light on the varied demand patterns across segments. He noted that sectors like auto, cement, electronics, and white goods have experienced robust demand.

Singhania expected demand to continue improving, particularly with government investments in infrastructure and development projects.

However, Singhania acknowledged the challenges faced by certain sectors, such as chemicals, which have been hit by demand issues, input costs, and geopolitical factors. He mentioned concerns raised by FMCG companies about tepid demand in rural areas, highlighting a nuanced growth scenario within different product categories.

The production enhancement plan includes opening of new mines, expansion of capacity of mines and production from captive/commercial mines. The Coal Ministry has indicated that the production plans for 2027 and 2030 will far exceed the likely domestic requirement of thermal power plants in India, including that for likely additional capacity.

The coal supplied to domestic coal-based power plants is around 821 MT for the current year. As per the government, the coal requirement for additional thermal capacity would be around 400 MT at 85% PLF (Plant Load Factor), and the actual requirement may be lower depending on the generation requirements in the coming times due to contributions from renewable sources. The current coal stock at thermal power plants (TPP) is around 20 MT, and at the mines it is around 41.59 MT. The total stock (including transit and captive mines) is 73.56 MT as compared to 65.56 MT during last year, indicating a year-on-year growth of 12%.

The lowest TPP stock for the current year was witnessed on October 16, after which stocks started building at thermal power plants as well as the end of the mines.

Union Minister of Coal, Mines and Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi will inaugurate the auction, further emphasising the government's commitment to accelerating the pace of development in the coal sector.

Since the initiation of commercial coal mining in 2020 — with the inaugural auctions launched by the prime minister — the ministry has conducted seven rounds, auctioning 91 mines with a peak rated capacity of 221 million tonne (MT) per annum.

The amendment of mineral laws played a pivotal role in unlocking the sector, ensuring a level playing field for both public and private sector participants, and permitting coal mine auctions without restrictions on end use.

The benefits of commercial coal mining have been manifold, promoting healthy competition, augmenting government revenue, and enhancing coal supply through private participation.

Importantly, the auctions have not only generated substantial revenues for the coal-rich states but have also catalysed regional development, providing direct and indirect employment opportunities.

The removal of bottlenecks and the provision of 'drone pictography' for each mine in the dossier aim to enhance the attractiveness of these mines for prospective bidders.

India has thus shown its commitment to the concept once again by taking another step forward, realising the equal importance of social sector development with the Social Stock Exchanges (SSEs) becoming reality today. While capitalism and socialism are long believed to be incompatible, in India we saw a paradigm shift after an announcement by the finance minister in 2019 on SSEs.

The process took almost four years, initiated by the constitution of a working group in the domain, followed by a comprehensive report, based on which a technical group was established, and then the introduction of zero coupon zero principal instruments for the first time in history via a notification by the ministry of finance. Immediately after, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) took a stride ahead and made the distant dream of SSEs a reality by introducing a robust and thorough framework for them.

Subsequently, both BSE and NSE recently launched their SSE segments with a bunch of applications already on their tables, having a vision of making an impact in the social sector, where the donor, with full faith, may contribute, entrusting all he wants, smoothly to the NGO of his choice. This journey of creating a fiduciary relationship comes with the stamp of the nation’s one of the most prominent regulators, i.e., SEBI, and both the renowned stock exchanges.

This has provided relief to the contributor that his money is handed over to the legitimate organisation for being used in the right direction and for the moral causes, as has been promised. These exchanges will provide a platform for investors to support social businesses and impact investing, revolutionising the traditional concept of stock markets.

With countries like the UK, Canada, Singapore, Brazil, and others that already have their SSEs established, the time for India has also come to wholeheartedly embrace this innovative model and bring the plans for socio-economic well-being and development to fruition, as it opens new avenues for social enterprises in the country.

The concept of SSEs revolves around trading platforms dedicated to listing social businesses that operate in a corporate style but with a social mission. SSEs allow ethical investors to invest in businesses aligned with their values, creating a parallel social economy.

India, with its vast population and diverse social challenges, stands to benefit greatly from SSEs. These will enable social enterprises to raise funds from the public, enhancing their visibility and fostering transparency in fund mobilisation and utilisation. By providing a separate platform for social enterprises, the SSEs will attract ethical investors looking to make a positive impact.

This will not only bolster social businesses but also contribute to the country’s sustainable development goals. The three key pillars of a social trading platform could be the demand-side ecosystem (social organisations); the supply-side ecosystem (investors); and the infrastructure (the SSE and its intermediaries); however, the government would play a critical role as the market maker and influencer.

The above factors would also serve as a catalyst for social finance in the nation, offering several benefits. Firstly, these will provide much-needed capital to social enterprises that often struggle to access traditional funding sources. Secondly, these will enhance transparency by requiring regular audits of social activities and impact reporting, which will build trust among investors and stakeholders. Additionally, these SSEs will increase the visibility of social enterprises, attracting both retail and institutional investors interested in supporting socially impactful ventures.

The countries that have already ventured into space provide a good learning landscape for Bharat. While the UK's SSE, for instance, serves as a directory of socially impactful companies, providing visibility to potential investors, Canada's ‘Social Venture Connexion’ acts as a ‘trusted connector’, linking social businesses with interested impact investors and service providers. Whereas Singapore's ‘Impact Investment Exchange’ functions similarly to the UK’s SSE, showcasing valued social businesses and impact investing funds.

South Africa's ‘SASIX’ offers ethical investors a platform to buy shares in social projects based on sector and province classifications. These international SSEs provide valuable insights and understandings into building a robust and impactful model in India.

Since the country just started and is fixated on the idea, it still has a long way to go and scale up infrastructure and capacities; however, the active and continuous participation of stakeholders may prove to be a persuasive process, and efforts may lead to great success, setting standards in the domain once again for the world.

To ensure the accomplishment of the objectives of Bharat’s SSEs, several key considerations must be taken into account, including but not limited to the accreditation processes that must be established for social businesses, ethical investors, and intermediaries, along with the formation of proper rating mechanisms, the process of audits, and the qualification of auditors; the mandatory and timely disclosures on operations and activities; the filing of financial statements, balance sheets, and annual returns; and the public placement of annual and other time-to-time reports, amongst many other compliance requirements.

All this will make sure that SSEs flourish, resulting in the unification of numerous platforms with consistent funding, appropriate utilisation of resources, impact generation, measurement of the impact, and fair and transparent reporting procedures. The establishment of SSEs in our country marks a transformative leap in social finance, empowering social businesses and impacting investors to address critical challenges. By drawing lessons from international SSEs and fostering collaboration, Bharat is all set to create an inclusive and impactful SSEs’ ecosystem, shaping a better future for all.

Despite a slowdown in developed nations, the survey indicates that this acceleration is expected to continue in the subsequent quarters.

Share Market Live NSE

In Q1 (April-June), 57% of respondents reported increased production levels, which gained further traction in Q2 (July-September) with over 79% noting higher production. Order books also reflect this positive trend, with 80% of respondents reporting increased orders, indicating optimistic demand conditions.

The survey covered ten major sectors, drawing responses from over 380 manufacturing units with a combined annual turnover exceeding ₹ 4.88 lakh crore. Here are the key findings from the survey.

Capacity Addition & Utilisation

Average capacity utilisation stands at 74%, slightly higher than in previous quarters, reflecting sustained economic activity. The investment outlook has improved, with 57% of respondents planning investments and expansions in the next six months, a slight increase from the previous survey.

Constraints and Inventories

The survey identifies demand as a major constraint, with over 40% of respondents highlighting inadequate demand as a significant hurdle. High raw material prices, increased finance costs, and supply-chain disruptions are also noted. In Q2, 85% of respondents reported either higher or the same levels of inventory compared to the previous quarter.

Exports, Hiring, and Interest Rates

Export performance improved, with 48% reporting higher exports in the second quarter compared to 33% in the first quarter. The hiring outlook remains stable, with 38% planning to hire additional workforce in the next three months. Additionally, 59% of respondents reported a marginal increase in interest rates over the previous quarter.

Sectoral Growth and Production Cost

According to the survey, outperforming sectors include electronics and white goods, cement, automotive, and machine tools. In contrast, others like capital goods and construction machinery, chemicals, textiles, metals, and paper showed moderate growth.

""The cost of production as a percentage of sales for manufacturers in the survey has risen for 58% of respondents compared to 77% of respondents for the previous quarter. Nonetheless, high raw material prices and high energy costs are the two main factors contributing to the high production costs,"" FICCI said.

Workforce Availability

The majority (82%) reported no issues with workforce availability, but 18% expressed concerns about the lack of skilled workforce in their sectors."

Some market watchers also expect a near-term reduction in banks’ reserve requirement ratio.

Share Market Live NSE

The People’s Bank of China will offer 950 billion yuan ($130 billion) through the medium-term lending facility Wednesday, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That would exceed the 850 billion yuan maturing this month. Most economists expect the one-year policy interest rate to remain unchanged at 2.5%.

Liquidity conditions have tightened as a deluge of bond issuance to fund fiscal stimulus, along with year-end cash demand from corporates, drove up money market rates. A spike in short-term borrowing costs late last month rattled markets, putting pressure on the PBOC to keep funding costs stable and facilitate the economic recovery.

Should Wednesday’s liquidity infusion prove modest, expectations that Beijing will reduce the amount that banks have to set aside as reserves may gather traction. Even if the PBOC offers around 1 trillion yuan as some economists project, which would be the most since 2021, the net injection will still trail that of the previous month due to maturing loans.

Mizuho Securities Co. and ANZ Bank China Co. are among those expecting a reduction in the required ratio in the coming weeks.

“The odds for an imminent reserve-requirement ratio cut is very high given structurally tight funding on the back of recent stronger primary issuance and to facilitate smooth issuance of upcoming special government bonds,” said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong. “The PBOC will watch out for liquidity stress more carefully given the episode at end-October.”

A reduction of 25 basis points in the required ratio would release around 500 billion yuan into the financial system, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

As authorities ramp up fiscal spending, banks are facing the dueling tasks of absorbing government bond supply while boosting lending to invigorate domestic demand. That’s made liquidity management increasingly complicated in recent months, especially as the country faces huge capital outflows across stocks, bonds and foreign direct investment.

The bond supply bonanza is expected to continue in the months ahead, with the Ministry of Finance planning an additional one trillion yuan in sovereign bonds in a rare mid-year revision to the fiscal budget. That comes after central and local governments took their borrowing spree in October to a new monthly high for the year.

“PBOC will likely rollover as keeping liquidity balanced amid all the extra issuances is crucial at this juncture,” said Lin Jing Leong, a senior emerging market sovereign analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Singapore. They likely don’t want to risk “liquidity tightening up and seizing the market when they are trying to support growth,” she said."
27,CNBC,Bottomline | Why US debt woes may be an opportunity,https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/why-us-debt-woes-may-be-an-opportunity-18309341.htm,"Nov 12, 2023 11:07 AM","Global rating agency Moody's has changed its outlook on US sovereign debt to negative even as it has retained the top Aaa rating. The move suggests a step towards a downgrade if financial conditions don't improve. At the core of Moody's concerns is unbridled fiscal spending. ""In the context of higher interest rates, without effective fiscal policy measures to reduce government spending or increase revenues, Moody's expects that the US' fiscal deficits will remain very large, significantly weakening debt affordability,"" the agency said.

Share Market Live NSE

It is important to note here that Moody's isn't the first to caution on the deterioration in US fiscal health . Fitch had in August cut its rating to AA+ from AAA. While a potential downgrade is a key risk to factor in for investors, and it could push yields higher to factor in the cut, it is unlikely to cause a significant stir for two reasons: first, much of the fiscal health has already been factored in by the markets, and second, US debt is still among the safest bets for large investments in the world.

Given this, let's look at what this development and the ""higher for longer (rates)"" stance of central banks can spell for investors.

What history tells us

Bond markets in the US, like any other, have had their share of tops and troughs. No market has a linear move, and this provides patient investors an opportunity for gains. Interest rates being higher for longer is good news for investors as it allows them more time to lock-in funds for the long term at higher yields.

A look at how the US market has behaved over the years suggests a sharp decline in yields after every top. The median and mean declines from tops to troughs since 1981 stand between 43% and 44.3%. Even the most recent three instances have seen drawdowns between 25% and 36.5%. These sharp moves present significant opportunities also for capital gains.

Here, the unprecedented rise in yields in the recent past needs to be appreciated. US bond yields have moved up from a low of 0.38% in 2018 to a high of 5% in October 2023—that's in just five years. In contrast, yields, after hitting a high of 7.9% in November 1994, dipped to a low of 2% in June 2008. That's a good thirteen-and-a-half years for a 6% move. And while we did see a big move from 15.8% in September 1981 to 10.2% in February 1983, in terms of percentage change, it is clearly dwarfed by the recent move to a high of 5%. What this suggests is that any correction of this unprecedented move, if and when it occurs, could be swift and big.

But the big question on everyone's mind is: Have interest rates peaked? The narrative on this is evolving even as I write this. From interest rates having topped out a week ago, there now seems to be some shift of bets towards another rate hike with a no interest rate cut but higher for longer narrative. But sift through the commentary, and what emerges is that most don't see interest rates heading much higher. For long-term investors, that's as good a cue as possible. Locking into higher rates by investing a part of your total allocation over the next 6 to 9 months could be a good approach.

The case of US bonds

There are two reasons for Indian investors to consider investing in overseas bonds. First, is the attractive returns they offer. The second, is the relative safety (academically in the short-term). Let’s look at this. On a plain reading, US bond yields on a 10-year security at near 4.7% would look unattractive vis-à-vis the near 7.3% on Indian Government securities of a similar tenure. However, for a fair comparison, the dollar-rupee factor must be brought into the equation. Over the past 20 years, the rupee has depreciated at a compounded 3% per year against the US dollar. If you add that to the US bond yield, the ultimate return climbs to 7.7%.

What's more, just like with any other debt instrument, investors should take note of the rating quality of the debt they are investing in. Here too, the US scores among the highest ratings in the world, despite recent concerns. Moody’s still retains an Aaa rating for the US, but ascribes a Baa3 rating to Indian sovereign debt. A look at the ratings snapshot below offers a perspective.

SOVEREIGN CREDIT RATINGS Country S&P Moody's US AAA Aaa Canada AAA Aaa Germany AAA Aaa UAE AA Aa2 UK AA Aa3 France AA Aa2 South Korea AA Aa2 China A+ A1 Japan A+ A1 Saudi Arabia A A1 Thailand BBB+ Baa1 Mexico BBB Baa2 India BBB- Baa3 Vietnam BB+ Ba2 Brazil BB- Ba2

Here, it pays to mention that in the near term, barring any unforeseen, radical developments, for all practical purposes, US Government and Indian Government debt can be considered equally safe with respect to payment of interest and return of principal. Hence, a significantly lower rating alone should not prompt you to shift allocation from local bonds to overseas bonds.

Good time to bond

For investors, the important point is that this could be a good time to invest in debt. But look for safe options rather than get drawn by mouth-watering yields, as high yields only come with higher risk. While the more informed could consider corporate debt as an option, for most investors, government securities are a better direct investment option. Investors can also look at gilt funds and debt funds with a healthy performance track record.

Entirely out of the blue, the rupee broke the one-year-old support level of 83.30 and traded close to 83.40 for the better part of the day before strengthening to close at 83.34, a new all-time closing low . We will get to the mid-day drama of panic when the electronic trading system froze in a bit.

Share Market Live NSE

Market reporters struggled to find a reason for the rupee's fall today because crude is a good 20% below its October highs and the dollar index is 2% off its October highs. Yet the Indian currency has remained in a tight range of 83.05 to 83.30 for almost 30 trading sessions from September 26 to November 9.

In these seven weeks, US yields have climbed from 4.3% to 5% on October 19 and back again to 4.6%. The dollar index swayed from 105.5 to 107 (on October 3) and back to 105.9 today. Brent crude went to a high of $97 per barrel on September 26 and tumbled to a low of 79.20 on November 9. All these are seminal to the dollar-rupee, and the currency should have bounced in an 8–10% range.

But no, the rupee remained in a tight 0.2% range of 83.05 to 83.29 thanks to heavy intervention by the RBI, mostly in the NDF (or non-deliverable forwards), which is an offshore market in countries like Hong Kong and Dubai where hedge funds punt on the currency.

The strong intervention by the RBI in these markets nullified any speculative attack on the rupee in late September when crude held around $95 per barrel for nearly a week. This intervention also nullified rupee shorts when US 10-year treasury yields surged to 5% in mid-October.

But the RBI's intervention in the NDF markets only nullifies the speculators, a dealer at a large private bank explained. The inherent demand for dollars from FPIs pulling out their equity investments in India and from Indian oil companies remains.

Today, the RBI apparently chose to let go. It had to, at some point, end the bogey of protecting the 83.30 level, and it probably chose a day when crude and the dollar index were calm. So the fall today wasn't swift or speculative, but backed by genuine buyers.

However, there were 13 long moments of madness around noon when the rupee, which was holding around 83.38/39, suddenly fell to 83.45. The reason was an outage on Refinitiv, the electronic FX trading platform. FX traders couldn't log in, and a brief panic gripped the market. But by 12.15, calm was restored as the platform started working again.

Clearly, the RBI was not amused. Refinitiv has been asked to explain the circumstances that led to the outage and if the standard operating procedures relating to business continuity were in place and were followed. It has also asked Refinitiv if it was a technical outage or a human error. The central bank is right to be concerned since such outages can cause uncertainty and even panic in the markets and lead to large losses.

But aside from the brief drama, today will be remembered by FX market watchers as the one when the RBI unloaded the yoke of 83.30. It's unclear why RBI has chosen this level and stuck to it for so many turbulent weeks. For traders, it is the hereafter that matters more. Most see 83.50/$ as the next support for the rupee, while some think a decline towards 84 can't be ruled out by the end of the fiscal year.

The RBI likes a gently depreciating rupee to adjust to the inflation differential, as dealers have explained in the past. Also, selling dollars closer to 84 can help the RBI post some profit and declare a handsome dividend to the government this year."

Share Market Live NSE

“The current trajectory is in many ways unsustainable…the US fiscal problem is much bigger than is currently understood. And this will mean that things will eventually come to a head and then something breaks. And then the only solution is for the Fed to start buying US Treasuries again. So I think that's the only thing that we need to wait for. Till then, I would remain very cautious,” said Neelkanth while speaking to CNBCTV18’s Latha Venkatesh.

Neelkanth rubbished the hopes that there can be a soft landing. ""People are not acknowledging the fact that the US fiscal deficit went up by nearly 4% of GDP,” he explained. The common perception is that yields went up because of high inflation, and they will fall as inflation starts falling. “And everything will be hunky dory.”

What's being ignored, he says, is that the US deficit has gone up from $1 trillion in FY22 to $2 trillion in FY23. ""As emerging countries like India well know, a sharp cut in the deficit will hurt growth badly. ""I don't think there's any chance of a soft landing,"" he said.

The US, Neelkanth explained, has changed its way of tackling declining growth. In 2008, it tried a loose monetary policy and tight fiscal policy and found it didn’t work. Growth stayed weak. So this time since covid, the US has changed to a tight monetary policy but loose fiscal.

However, a higher deficit means a higher term premium and higher bond yields at the longer end. But a lot of the financial instruments and structures that have been built up over the past decade were built during a period of zero interest rates, and some of these will collapse.

“There will be a point where it looks like things are falling apart. And then the Fed has to step in. The question is, will they step in early or will they allow some of the damage to happen…we have to wait to see how much damage are they willing to allow to happen before they step in, but I think it's time to stay cautious.""

He added that US debt is running at 150% of GDP, and it’s a matter of time before the Fed starts buying treasuries.

So what does this mean for India? Neelkanth sees three channels through which India will get impacted: Firstly, services exports will decline; they already have, as one can see from IT earnings. Secondly, goods exports too will fall as the US is a big importer, and a US slowdown will also take the wind out of other importers from India. Finally, as US yields remain strong, global funds will rush to the US treasuries market. FDI and FPI flow into India are already falling and will fall further, nor will Indian corporates raise ECBs abroad.

""It would become very hard to finance even a $40-$50 billion current account deficit for India,” he said, adding that India is better off. A country like Indonesia has had to raise rates even though inflation is under control because of the interest rate differential with the US and the threat that it poses to the exchange rate.

Neelkanth’s advice is that traders must be nimble like players in a game of chess and respond to the Fed’s reaction to the imminently unfolding slowdown and other problems. Investors must stay invested but have to get accustomed to lower valuations of 16–17 times versus the current 20 times.

Neelkanth expects a long-term correction in the stock market. This means he sees the indexes and stock prices not rising much, with higher EPS growth getting neutralised by falling P/E.

However, individual companies will outperform the indexes. He favours power and power equipment companies given the power shortages and the growth in demand. He likes real estate companies given the start of the cycle, and he likes financials as they are the best plays on a domestic economy, which is still growing fine. In fact, unlike many economists who see India’s near-term growth at 6–6.5%, Neelkanth sees the Indian economy growing by 7% over the next five years given the improvement in labour productivity and investments in infrastructure.

Share Market Live NSE

Gross domestic product was unchanged from the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a 0.1% decline on average. In September alone, GDP rose 0.2%.

A quarter of stagnation had been predicted by the Bank of England, which expects the economy to register no growth at all next year. Consumer spending, business investment and government spending all fell in the third quarter, leaving the economy underpinned by a better trade performance as exports rose and imports declined.

That’s a bleak prospect for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as he gears up for an election expected next year. Polls put the ruling Conservatives on track to lose power to the opposition Labour Party. The figures come less than two weeks before Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his autumn statement to Parliament, which is expected to unveil measures to boost growth.

“Britain is a stagnation nation that has struggled to secure sustained economic growth since the financial crisis,” said James Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation think tank. “Addressing this is the central task we face as a country, and must be at the heart of the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement in 10 days’ time.”

The contraction in the domestic economy may also help to convince BOE policymakers they have done enough to bring inflation under control after raising interest rates from 0.1% to 5.25% in less than two years. Resolution said that the growth slowdown is being caused in part by high rates.

Chief Economist Huw Pill signaled as much in an address on Thursday after the central bank downgraded its growth outlook last week. However, both he and Governor Andrew Bailey have stressed the need to keep borrowing costs in “restrictive” territory for an extended period to bear down on underlying price pressures.

Traders are betting that rates have peaked with the BOE expected to begin cutting rates from August next year. The path for BOE interest rates remained broadly unchanged on Friday with a 15% chance of a 25-basis-point increase next month and almost three quarter-point cuts by the end of next year.

“High inflation is the single greatest barrier to economic growth. The best way to sustainably grow our economy right now is stick to our plan and knock inflation on its head,” Hunt said in a statement. “The Autumn Statement will focus on how we get the economy growing healthily again by unlocking investment, getting people back into work and reforming our public services so we can deliver the growth our country needs.”

The economy faced headwinds on several fronts in the third quarter. Public-sector strikes hit schools and the health service while retailers suffered from wet weather in July and unseasonably warm temperatures in September that led consumers to put off buying autumn and winter clothes. Hanging over everything was the squeeze of higher borrowing costs.

Over the quarter, consumer spending fell 0.4%, business investment plunged 4.2%, and government consumption declined 0.5%, partly reflecting strikes by doctors. Net trade contributed 0.43 percentage points to GDP.

The total trade balance improved by £7.1 billion ($8.7 billion) to £6 billion, dropping back to levels seen before the UK formally left the European Union in January 2021, and before the pandemic. The improvement was driven a steep fall in imports and a small rise in exports – as more sales of UK services just offset a fall in sales of UK goods.

On the output side, construction and manufacturing both rose 0.1%, helping to offset a 0.1% contraction in services. Within the services sector, transport and real estate posted the largest declines, with the latter reflecting the downturn in the housing market. Consumer-facing services overall fell 0.7% as households cut back.

Over the month, services rose 0.2%, with health services boosted by the roll-out of the latest Covid-19 vaccination campaign. However, consumer-facing services declined for a second month, while construction and industrial production barely contributed to growth."

Kenneth Andrade, Founder & CEO of Old Bridge Capital Management, believes that while consumption at the higher end of the population pyramid remains robust, the lower end is facing significant stress and limited demand.

""Consumption is back on the table for us, especially if you go stock picking into individual businesses....what we essentially look for is which company can premiumise and take the consumer to the next level of pricing,” said Andrade, who manages funds worth over $750 million.

Andrade's perspective aligns with that of Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder of Marcellus Investment Managers who also recently observed India's shift from 'mass consumption' to 'class consumption'

""The era of mass consumption, in terms of purchases of low-cost apparel, footwear, etc., is behind us. We are in an era where affluent, well-educated people earn more money and are moving toward class consumption,"" he said.

This shift is further evidenced by recent trends in Income Tax (I-T) filings, which show a growing economic disparity. High-income earners are seeing a much faster increase in tax filings compared to those with an annual income below ₹5 lakh.

According to a note released by BNP Paribas in October, this trend, indicating the rich getting richer, could positively impact sectors such as automobile manufacturing, insurance, mutual funds, jewellery, multiplexes, and healthcare. The data shows that income tax filers with an annual income above ₹10 lakh have seen a 20% increase from 2012 to 2021, in stark contrast to a mere 4.5% growth for those earning below ₹5 lakh.

In fact, India's consumer market is poised to become the world's third-largest by 2027, propelled by an increase in middle to high-income households, according to a report by Fitch Solutions' BMI, as cited by CNBC. Currently ranked fifth, India is expected to witness a 29% surge in real household spending, which Fitch predicts will elevate the country to the third position in the global market."

“If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so,” Powell said in opening remarks prepared for a panel discussion at an International Monetary Fund conference in Washington on Thursday.

“We will continue to move carefully, however, allowing us to address both the risk of being misled by a few good months of data, and the risk of overtightening,” he said.

Powell said policymakers are committed to ensuring interest rates are high enough to return inflation to their 2% target, but added, “we are not confident that we have achieved such a stance.”

“We still believe the Fed is done hiking for this cycle, but today’s speech should serve as notice that their rhetoric must stay hawkish until they’ve seen further improvement in inflation,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief US Economist Michael Feroli said in a note to clients.

Treasuries extended their losses from a poorly received 30-year bond sale after Powell’s remarks, and the market pushed the timing of the Fed’s first expected quarter-point rate cut out to July from June next year.

US central bankers are trying to assess whether they need to take their benchmark policy rate slightly higher, and debating how long they should hold rates at elevated levels. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee last week held rates at 5.25% to 5.5% range, the highest level in 22 years.

Inflation has decelerated, but remains above the Fed’s target, at 3.4% for the year through September. Fed officials are set to meet again on December 12-13.

In his speech, the Fed chief said it wasn’t clear how much more inflation progress can be made in the future through supply-side improvements.

“Going forward, it may be that a greater share of the progress in reducing inflation will have to come from tight monetary policy restraining the growth of aggregate demand,” Powell said.

He also suggested the central bank will undertake another review of its policy framework beginning in 2024 , after announcing an overhaul in 2020.

“Among the questions we will consider is the degree to which the structural features of the economy that led to low interest rates in the pre-pandemic era will persist,” Powell said. “With time, we will continue to learn from the experience of the past few years, and what implications it may hold for monetary policy.”

Shortly after he began speaking, Powell was hustled out of the conference room as a group of about a dozen environmental protesters jumped on stage. Brandishing a banner, they chanted and spoke out for about five minutes before departing."

During his visit to the US, Trivedi found that investor interest in India, including from institutions and family offices, has reached unprecedented levels, often at China's expense.

“MSCI China, for example, is at 9.3 times calendar 24 PE, we are 20 times so we are at 115% premium to China and in spite of that, the lack of interest remains in China,” Trivedi highlighted.

After a strong start to 2023, the Chinese economic activity has sharply fallen short of expectations. Exports have collapsed and consumption, production and investment have slowed. While inflation has levelled out, the unemployment rate has edged up.

China may have the resilience to stage a comeback, but the negative perception seems to be driving away investments from China. Foreign investments in China have turned negative for the first time since records began in 1998. China's direct investment liabilities declined by $11.8 billion in the third quarter of 2023.

Trivedi indicated that inflows from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are expected to be subdued into the early part of the next year, pending a substantial market correction. But he also highlighted the strong confidence of domestic investors in India, which sustains ongoing investment in the equity markets and keeps valuations high.

""In these circumstances, monetary policy remains watchful and actively disinflationary to progressively align inflation to the target, while supporting growth,"" Shaktikanta Das said in a speech delivered in Japan.

India's retail inflation eased to a three-month low of 5.02% in September on the back of softer vegetable prices, but remained above the RBI's 4% target.

The central bank, which has kept the key policy rate unchanged over the last four meetings, expects inflation to average at 5.4% in fiscal year 2023-24, a moderation from 6.7% in the last fiscal year.

Governor Das had said in early October the central bank remains highly alert and prepared to take steps to align inflation to the target.

Retail inflation data for October is due Nov. 13.

The recent developments in West Asia have added to the ""litany of challenges"" for the global economy, the RBI chief said on Thursday, adding that the central bank has bolstered foreign exchange reserves to deal with potential eventualities.

India's growth remains on track, and its current account deficit ""eminently manageable"", while the balance sheets of banks and corporates are healthy, the RBI governor said.

Meanwhile, a linkage of India and Japan's fast payment systems may be explored to make cross-border payments more efficient and less costly, the governor said.

The government is seeking suggestions from the industry and other stakeholders on this.

Goyal stated that the bill aims to provide relief to startups, MSMEs and small businesses by reducing paperwork and compliance burden. However, he clarified that Jan Vishwas Bill-3 may be needed despite the best of efforts.

The Jan Vishwas Bill had decriminalised minor offences by bringing them from the ambit of the judiciary to the ambit of administration. Many such minor offences used to attract jail terms or penalties for non-compliance.

Pointing out that the government is looking at ways to ease restrictions on SEZ (Special Economic Zones) units, Goyal added that deliberations and discussions with stakeholders are underway with an aim to boost prospects of SEZ units. With certain curbs on duty-free domestic sale of products, SEZs are currently considered foreign territories for levy of customs duties as per Indian law.

Several companies located in SEZs have sought exemption from customs duties to sell their products within India. Informing that the government will move ""cautiously"" on the industry's demand for extension of benefits of the RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products) scheme to SEZs, he said that the demand will be considered once the government is confident of not falling foul of World Trade Organization (WTO) norms with the move.

While the minister called for grant of extended approvals to incentivise companies using the National Single Window portal to approach the government for permissions, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh pointed out that the industry is still not using the portal enough and is still resorting to intermediaries.

But with almost all of the demonetised currency of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 notes coming back into the system and the after-thought goal was also to reduce the cash intensity of the economy. Seven years since the event- cash in circulation has more than doubled.

Share Market Live NSE

From about ₹ 16.63 lakh crore in FY16 before demonetisation – which then went down to ₹ 13.35 lakh crore immediately after, cash in circulation is now nearly ₹ 34 lakh crore.

Steady Rise In Cash Transactions

#RBI Data

Even if you were to look at cash as a percentage of GDP, it has grown steadily from 8.7% after demonetisation to nearly 13% now. The last few years have seen the currency in circulation (CIC) to Gross domestic product (GDP) ratio decline, but that’s also to do with the GDP hit on the economy due to COVID-19.

Let's also take a look at the banknotes in circulation. Of the total value of the currency in circulation in India in FY23, ₹ 500 notes formed a massive 77.1%, and their share has only gone up since demonetisation.

The data also suggest that the recall of the ₹ 2,000 note might not make much of a difference currently. They were introduced after demonetisation to quickly meet currency requirements of the economy after ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 notes were removed overnight—and have now been withdrawn, but their share has steadily been coming down since its printing was stopped in 2018.

At the same time, India has seen a boom in digital transactions, largely thanks to UPI, which now has over 330 million unique users. It forms more than 78% of India's total retail digital payments today. Last month, UPI crossed a whopping 11.4 billion monthly transactions, setting a new record with transaction value surpassing ₹ 17.6 lakh crore.

RBI is also now betting on retail Central Bank Digital Currency picking up, currently clocking 15,000 daily transactions, which RBI estimates will be 1 million a day by the end of the year.

While digital is becoming a popular mode for transactions- it has hardly replaced hard cash which remains king- even seven years after demonetisation!

“The early signs of the sellings by e-commerce companies are giving hope that this time hopefully, the bottom of the pyramid will also participate in the festival season as much as the top of the pyramid,” Shah said.

Shah's positive outlook aligns with Amazon's recent announcement. On Tuesday, November 7, the e-commerce behemoth reported that its 2023 festive sale was the most successful in its 13-year history in India.

E-tailer sales during the first four days of this festive season jumped 16% year-on-year, reaching a GMV of ₹29,000 crore, per a Business Standard report.

Last year, between September 22 and October 23, the total gross merchandise value (GMV) or total value of merchandise sold across e-commerce platforms stood at nearly ₹76,000 crore. In September, Redseer predicted the festive season sales of 2023 across e-commerce platforms to reach a gross merchandise value of around ₹90,000 crore, an 18-20% growth over last year's festive month sales.

Shah also noted that as elections approach, governments often take measures to boost consumer sentiment. This can include initiatives that put more money into the hands of the public, stimulating spending and economic activity.

“Normally we have seen ahead of elections government puts money in the pockets of consumers, and there is a higher velocity of money due to spending. Now that should generally go to the bottom of the pyramid and they should be looking to spend money rather than save, unlike the top of the pyramid.”

Share Market Live NSE

New Delhi is considering a concessional tariff of 30% on 2,500 electric vehicles imported annually from the UK priced above $80,000, the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are private. India currently levies taxes between 70% and 100% on cars imported as completely built units, depending on their value.

The UK’s demand for import concessions on electric vehicles is one of the few outstanding issues in the free trade talks. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi had hoped to finalize the agreement by the end of last month, but it’s unlikely a deal will now be announced until December, Bloomberg News previously reported.

India’s trade ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for information. A spokesperson for the UK Trade Department declined to comment as the talks are still ongoing.

India is the world’s most populous country, with demand for electric vehicles rising among middle-class and wealthy buyers. The adoption of EVs in the country has been held back by the high cost of the cars, a dearth of options and lack of charging stations. Opening up the EV segment of the market could also speed up cleaner transport in a nation with the world’s most toxic air.

Electric vehicle sales in India stood at 49,800 last year, making up just 1.3% of the 3.8 million passenger vehicles sold, according to BloombergNEF.

In India’s cost-conscious market, the country’s best-selling electric car, Tata Motors Ltd.’s Nexon.ev, is priced at less than 1.5 million rupees ($18,000). German luxury automakers BMW AG, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Volkswagen AG’s Audi sell electric cars above $80,000 in India.

Modi’s government is treading cautiously on EV imports as it seeks to build a domestic manufacturing industry for electric vehicles and parts. The government in 2021 announced a $3.1 billion production-linked incentive program for local EV production.

A final decision on India’s position on import duties on EVs has yet to be made, according to people familiar with the discussions.

India and the UK had already softened their position on a number of issues, including reducing tariffs on British cars and scotch whisky, Bloomberg News previously reported.

The two countries expect the free trade deal would double bilateral trade by 2030 through lower tariffs and increased market access. It would also be a political win for both leaders, with the UK-India pact seen as a key prize of Brexit and a way to boost India’s manufacturing ambitions.

India imposes a range of import duties on cars. For vehicles purchased from overseas unassembled, the tax ranges from 15% to 35%."

In October 2023, India's steel imports outstripped exports by 0.28 million tonne (MT).

Share Market Live NSE

Chairman and managing director of Tata Steel, TV Narendran has described India's status as a net importer of steel as a matter of concern, stating that the government has assured of intervention if imports continue to rise.

While he attributed the softening of international steel prices to a large amount of production by China, president of the Indian Steel Association and CEO of ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Dilip Oommen termed China as a threat to the world's steel industry.

Oommen explained that China's steel production has fallen but its production hasn't, which has led to an increase in steel exports by India's northern neighbour.

Describing India's position as the spotlight in global steel consumption, he warned that India faces the highest threat of cheap steel imports flooding its domestic market if action isn't taken in time.

While he pointed out that many commodity steels coming into India can easily be produced by domestic players, he suggested that BIS certification should be curtailed for those imported steel products that the local industry is capable of producing.

Defending the idea of import substitution in the steel sector, he clarified that all countries have put up trade barriers in some form or the other, be it the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) or import duties.

Commenting on the impact of the proposed scrap metal export restrictions by the European Union (EU), Oommen told CNBC-TV18 that scrap will be a precious commodity in the future as all countries will try to use their own scrap.

This growth came on the back of volume growth surpassing price growth for the third quarter in a row.

Share Market Live NSE

For the quarter, volumes in the FMCG industry grew by 8.6%, indicating an 8% growth over the same period last year, while price growth came in at just 0.3%. This is also the highest volume growth recorded by the industry in nine quarters, after a 21.1% volume growth seen in the April-June quarter of 2021, and the 8% volume growth in the January-March quarter of 2021, both of which saw the second wave of COVID, which led to increased stocking up.

NIQ India's data also indicates that rural markets are showing signs of recovery, with consumption picking up during this quarter as compared to Q3 of 2022. Rural growth, which turned positive in Q1 of 2023, came in at 6.4% in the July-September quarter, as against a 4% growth last quarter and a decline of 3.6% in the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, urban markets maintained a stable rate of consumption growth with the same volume growth of 10.2% as last quarter as well.

""The FMCG industry has witnessed a further reduction in price growth from last quarter and has given a necessary impetus to the spending power of the consumer, this is evident in the rural markets in particular where there is an uptick in consumption across categories.

Overall, cooling of inflation in the country fueled by base effects; a recent decline in unemployment figures, and LPG prices amongst other factors have contributed to the willingness of the consumer to spend,"" said Satish Pillai, managing director, NIQ India in a statement.

Roosevelt D’souza, Lead of Customer Success at NIQ India added that there has been an increase in consumer spending on discretionary categories like personal care and home care products, which suggests that rural consumers are beginning to spend beyond essential categories. ""This change in spending could be attributed to easing inflationary pressures,"" he said.

In terms of categories, NIQ India said at an all-India level, both the food and non-food sectors are contributing to the growth in consumption, while non-food categories grew faster. Non-food categories grew at 12.4% aided by a higher price growth (3.4%) as compared to food categories (-1/5%).

Foods saw an overall value growth of 7.1%, while volumes for both grew 8.7% each in Q3 of 2022. This growth is primarily driven by products falling under the impulse (like salty snacks, chocolates, and confectionery) and habit-forming (like biscuits, tea, coffee, etc.) categories. ""Impulse food categories continue to exhibit strong growth, and we see a growth recovery in habit-forming categories such as biscuits, tea, noodles, coffee, etc. after five quarters,"" D’souza said.

Notably, volume growth for personal care has turned positive for the first time in rural. In urban areas as well, the non-food sector is witnessing an improvement in consumption growth, with a growth rate of 10.4% in Q3 2023, up from 8.9% in Q2 2023.

Consumption is being propelled by an increase in the number of units sold across rural, traditional trade (TT), and modern trade (MT). NIQ India said modern trade is experiencing robust double-digit consumption growth at 19.5%, while traditional trade is also on the rise, with consumption improving to 7.5% in Q3 2023, up from 6.2% in the preceding quarter (Q2 2023).

In terms of pack sizes, smaller-sized packs have higher off-take in rural while in urban markets average pack sizes turn positive, though there is a continued preference towards larger packs. NIQ said while this indicates positive consumption patterns at an all-India level, the increased consumption can also be attributed to the 'robust expansion' of the FMCG sector. ""This renewed optimism across the country augurs well for the festive season,"" D’souza added.

Most FMCG companies, however, in their results for the July-September quarter, reported sluggish volume growth and indicated that while there are signs of recovery, the cautious optimism continues, the caution coming from erratic monsoon and food inflation, which has delayed rural growth to a certain extent, despite a fall in the overall cost of commodities.

For instance, Ritesh Tiwari, CFO of HUL said while addressing the media post its Q2FY23 results that rural markets are yet to recover fully and that volume recovery will be gradual. ITC, on the other hand, said consumption demand has been relatively subdued, especially in the value segment and rural markets on the back of sub-par monsoons and persistent Food inflation which saw a sharp spike during the quarter.

However, it added that green shoots of recovery are visible, with prospects of improved agri output, the onset of the festive season, an increase in rural wages, and government spending on infrastructure auguring well for a recovery in rural markets.

Britannia's Varun Berry also pointed out to a slowdown in FMCG while answering an analyst question. ""What we are seeing is a clear slowdown in rural. And despite our continuing to get deeper into rural areas, getting into more villages, etcetera, we have started to see the rural economy splutter a bit.

And when it comes back, we will benefit from that,"" he added."

Sources have told CNBC-Awaaz that the central government has received information about foreign portfolio investors through intelligence inputs, prompting this action.

Share Market Live NSE

According to sources, the Income Tax Department has initiated an investigation into suspicious foreign portfolio investors. The tax department has sought detailed information about funds coming to India from FPIs.

Following the receipt of intelligence inputs, the Income Tax Department has also sent notices to several FPIs. These notices include various inquiries, including the process of fund collection, among other questions, on behalf of the IT department.

Suspicion of round-tripping on FPIs

The Income Tax Department has expanded its scope of investigation by seeking details of the top 20 investors' names and addresses. Additionally, they have inquired from FPIs about which trading terminals were used to place orders. The suspicion arises from the concept of round-tripping on foreign portfolio investors.

Consequently, the tax department is now focusing on identifying genuine investors. According to the sources several countries with little or no taxes or significantly reduced taxes are suspected to be involved in round-tripping. These countries include the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Singapore, among others.

Provide investment details to FPIs

The tax department has also inquired about the process of reaching potential investors through FPIs. They have asked for details on any documents related to this process. Additionally, they have asked whether Indians have invested in your funds. The tax department has instructed FPIs to segregate assets under management (AUM) based on Indian and non-Indian investments and disclose the extent of each investment.

Share Market Live NSE

He went on to explain that there was a shortfall of 4.1 million tonnes (MT) in April 2023, followed by 1.8 MT in May, 3.8 MT in June, 2.4 MT in July, 7.1 MT in August and 8.3 MT in September. The average shortfall was 2.5 lakh tonnes (LT) last month.

Stating that a 20% rise in power demand for the past three months was indicative of the country's economic growth, he said that the government consciously chose imported coal blending over load shedding as the rise in coal production was outstripped by the rise in power demand.

India plans to add 78 GW thermal capacity and 50 GW hydro capacity by 2031/32, and 10 GW thermal capacity and 21 GW renewable energy capacity is to be added in FY 2023-24. While a shortfall of 38.1 MT coal was noted in FY 22-23, the Minister said there is a need to add more power capacity, more renewable than conventional, even as he assured that there was no difficulty noted in power transmission.

Indicating that the government is examining the shortfall of power in states like Bihar and Jharkhand which have noted unscheduled outages, he said that states have been asked to set up more pithead plants in coal bearing areas to reduce the cost of logistics.

To ensure non-stop operation of imported coal-based plants, fixed charges have been linked to their operation and all states have asked to run power plants at full capacity, while gas-based capacity has been kept on stand-by to meet non-solar hours demand. States not running their plants at peak demand won't be provided power from the central pool.

To encourage adoption of renewable energy, the government is looking to rectify rules enacted by several regulators in states which discouraged it. Discoms have also been asked to give a technical feasibility report in 15 days for rooftop solar panels, or else permission will be considered as granted."

Nakhate's comments echo the government's recent assertions that digitalisation will be a defining element in India’s growth narrative in the 21st century, as highlighted in the finance ministry's monthly economic report from September 22.

The digital economy’s contribution to India’s GDP has increased. it was 4-4.5% of the GDP in 2014 and is expected to cross 20% by 2026, a Hindustan Times report said quoting the finance ministry report.

Nakhate also highlighted the positive impact of increased government capital expenditure on the economy, remarking, ""I personally believe that India is embarking on a path of sustained and multifaceted growth. One of the key drivers of this growth is the government's investment in public infrastructure.""

Private sector capital expenditure has begun to align with government initiatives, with the private capex witnessing an 8% growth just last year, bringing it close to 59% of the total. With capacity utilisation at approximately 80%, Nakhate foresees a convergence between the public and private sectors as a significant development.

Nakhate also underlined India's consumption story highlighting the evolving dynamics of the middle class and its role in driving consumption. ""Within the middle class, we observe various strata, all progressing in terms of their consumption patterns.

Share Market Live NSE

""Sustained higher oil prices would... mean that the current account deficit would likely widen to beyond 2.5% of GDP - the comfort zone,"" economists at Morgan Stanley said.

Morgan Stanley estimates that every $10 rise in oil prices pushes up India's inflation by 50 basis points, assuming the higher costs are passed on to consumers, and widens the current account deficit by 30 basis points.

India's interest rate-setting panel hiked the policy repo rate by 250 basis points between May 2022 and February 2023 to combat inflationary pressures in the economy.

It has since held the rate steady at 6.50% but has said it remains focused on lowering inflation to the 4% target.

The central bank projects inflation at 5.4% in fiscal year 2023-24, basis an average crude oil price of $85 in October-March.

The Brent crude oil contract is currently trading near $85. India is one of the more exposed economies in Asia to higher oil prices, with an oil trade balance of -2.6% of GDP.

The ongoing war between Islamist group Hamas and Israel poses one of the most significant geopolitical risks to oil markets.

Morgan Stanley expects oil prices to rise to $95 per barrel in October-December, but then to decline into 2024.

If crude oil prices sustain around $95 per barrel, the impact on India's macro stability would be ""manageable"" but the upside to inflation would likely mean a delay to the central bank's ""shallow"" rate cut cycle, Morgan Stanley said.

The agency said that it is due to a 0.7pp cut to China.

Share Market Live NSE

The agency has lowered China's supply-side GDP growth potential to 4.6% from 5.3% due to slowing of the country's growth in recent years. The agency has also cut Russia's potential growth by 0.8pp to 0.8%.

The downward revision for China as against the July 2021 assessment is a result of weaker outlook for the employment rate and a reduced expectation for capital deepening in the next five years, considering significant reductions in investment growth forecasts. This decrease in capital deepening has resulted in lower projections for labor productivity growth, the rating agency said.

However, for Brazil, India, Mexico, Indonesia, Poland and Turkey, the agency has made upward revisions, due to swift recovery in labour force participation rates.

""GDP fell in all the EM10 except China and Turkiye in 2020, with very steep declines in India, Mexico and South Africa. Even after subsequent recoveries, GDP in 2022 was generally still far below levels implied by extrapolating prepandemic trends, particularly in India, Indonesia and Mexico,"" Fitch Ratings said in its report. The cumulative shortfall in the projected level of GDP by 2027 is largest in China at 6.3%, India at 5.8%, South Africa at 5.4% and Mexico at 3.8%, the agency said.

The agency has increased India's estimate by 0.7pp to 6.2%. Fitch said this was due to an improvement in the employment rate and increase in working-age population forecast. The agency noted that India's labour productivity forecast is also higher.

According to the report, India’s projected labour supply growth is lower as compared to 2019 due to the expected negative growth in the participation rate. Even when the participation rate has recovered from its pandemic slump, Fitch said it remains below levels recorded in the early 2000s.

Fitch added that the latest estimates remain below their pre-pandemic potential growth projections for all the EM10 except Brazil and Poland."

The scheme was due to expire later this year. Modi made the announcement while addressing a public rally in Chhattisgarh, where assembly elections will take place on November 7 and 17.

While the move will benefit 800 million people from rising food costs, the government's food subsidy bill will remain elevated. Sources told CNBC-TV18 that the Centre may incur an additional ₹15,000 crore annually for extending the free food grain scheme.

Over a five-year period, the additional cost for the government is likely to be upto ₹1 lakh crore. The budget estimates every year will be factoring in the extra cost to the fiscal, sources explained.

The government in December 2022 reworked the PMGKAY by stopping the additional supply of 5 kilos of free food grains under the public distribution system (PDS).

Instead, the normal entitlement under the National Food Security Act of 35 kg of food grains for Antyodaya Ann Yojana families and 5 kg for the Priority Households, which were sold at highly subsidised rates of ₹2/kg for wheat and ₹3/kg for rice, was made free of cost.

The government had said this reworked PMGKAY will continue till December 31, 2023, and the additional cost was factored in the FY24 food subsidy of ₹1.97 lakh crore. Sources added that the government will be well within this food subsidy budget in the current fiscal.

The ₹15,000 crore annual tab is the estimated earning via the ₹1, ₹2 and ₹3 charged for every kilo of coarse grains, wheat and rice sold through the PDS which the government would be forgoing as the distribution of grains will continue to be free.

Sources added that the longer-term fallout of these changes is the government will not have the flexibility to raise or charge the PDS rates for the next five years. Sources explained the NFSA has an option to raise the PDS price which now stands nullified due to the PMGKAY extension. ""From ₹3 you can to go to ₹5 but from zero you cannot go to ₹5,"" sources said.

Under these circumstances, along with the annual increases in the procurement costs India's food subsidy is likely to remain high, but significantly lower than the Covid years.

As per budget numbers, in FY21 the government coughed up a massive ₹5.41 lakh crore on food subsidy, which has progressively got lower to a ₹1.97 lakh crore subsidy tab in the current fiscal.

Share Market Live NSE

In an exclusive chat with CNBC-TV18, Aziz, the Global Head of Emerging Market Economics at JPMorgan, shed light on the Fed's seemingly steady stance amidst market uncertainties. He suggested that while the Fed has paused rate hikes in November, largely due to the looming threat of a US government shutdown, the decision for December remains open.

""On Friday, we are going to have the non-farm payroll, which will be a clear marker, and then we have the PCE numbers coming out,"" Aziz said. ""If the non-farm payroll numbers are a tad lower, and if you do see some cooling off in wage growth and PCE numbers holding where they are, then you might see the Fed also pause in December.""

The US non-farm payrolls data, expected later today (November 3), is seen adding 180,000 jobs in October, as opposed to 336,000 in September. Analysts also expect the unemployment rate to remain at 3.8% and wage growth to slow to 4%, a post-pandemic low.

The resilience of the US economy, with a robust growth rate of 4.9% in the third quarter, stands in contrast to the cautious stance of the Federal Reserve, which, according to insights from Citi's Robert Sockin , seems to have halted rate hikes for now.

In a post-Fed chat with CNBC-TV18, Sockin said, ""This is a Fed that really wants to be done hiking, really wants to move into a wait-and-see mode, and see how the data evolve from here."".

Following its two-day meeting in Washington, the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday (November 1) decided to leave the benchmark lending rate unchanged for the second time in a row, at 5.25% to 5.50%.

Aziz also turned his attention to India's economic forecast. He predicts a moderate slowdown, with growth rates hovering between 5.5% and 6%, as ""the global headwinds will start biting from quarter four.""

He emphasized that, under these global pressures, achieving an average growth rate of 5% in the next couple of years would be a commendable outcome for India.

""We are looking at a growth rate around 5% in 2024-2025 with clear downside risk because the global economy could slow down much faster given how tight the global financial conditions are,” he said.

Share Market Live NSE

This would mean “achieving an average monthly collection of ₹ 1.80 to ₹ 1.90 lakh crore in the next fiscal,” sources added.

With the setting of the target, a roadmap has also been drawn to achieve this, which includes, “working towards better compliance, moving ahead with the rate rationalisation exercise, more of data analytics through AI, data mapping, measures to strengthen the system to plug revenue leakages, enhanced scrutiny while allocating new GST registrations and restricting input tax credits,” sources added.

Not just this, apart from the strategy, the government has also identified the sectors which will help achieve these numbers. “Sectors such as online gaming, casinos, and race courses will add to the revenues with the clarity of 28% GST rate, the growing presence of digital economy and e-commerce players, new economy areas such as crypto and virtual digital assets and increased domestic consumption especially visible via growth in FMCG and consumer goods will help the government reach these numbers,” sources said.

Experts say that the asking rate is easily doable given the current trend of GST collections. It was on November 1, itself when the government announced the collections for the month of October which stood at ₹ 1,72,003 lakh crore. October collections are just the second-highest this year, but the second-highest since GST was introduced. GST revenue collected so far this Fiscal totals ₹ 11,64,511 crore, just 35% less than FY23’s full-year collections.

Khushbu Trivedi, Associate Director- Indirect Tax, Nangia Andersen India says, “In a plunge to surge the GST collections, Government is all gearing up to hit the revenues at higher growth rate with upcoming budget announcements. Compliance monitoring through an intelligence monitoring mechanism would be propitious in pulling off the growth targets by plugging revenue leakages. Also, recent measures in broadening of tax net through online gaming, cryptos and virtual digital assets might prove game changers in escalating revenues massively.”

Similarly, Archit Gupta, Founder and CEO, Clear, formerly known as ClearTax feels that, “With the coming of online gaming under tax ambit and uptake due to the festive season, there has been a spurt in GST collections. This trend shall continue for November and with increased coverage of GST.”

Moreover, a pick-up in inflation expectations in October dampened business confidence,"" Lima added. Going ahead, the Future Activity Index fell by more than five points in October, signalling some loss of confidence surrounding the outlook for services output, amid rising inflation expectations.

Meanwhile, the S&P Global India Composite PMI Output Index fell from 61 in September to 58.4 in October, indicating the weakest rate of expansion since March. ""Although India continued to post substantial growth of aggregate business activity, the upturn lost strength in October amid slower increases in manufacturing production and services activity,"" the survey said.

Prices charged for Indian goods and services rose further in October, thereby stretching the current sequence of inflation to nearly three years."

Shortly after this statement, the government released tax data for September, revealing a significant increase in gross tax revenues for July, August, and September — a growth of 27.8% compared to just 3.3% last quarter.

This has resulted in a respectable 16.3% growth in total tax revenue, surpassing the budgeted nominal GDP growth of 11% for the year.

When it comes to direct tax figures, the results are even more promising. Corporate taxes in Q2 surged by 45.8%, a stark contrast to the 13.9% decline in Q1. The accumulated growth for the first half of the year stands at a substantial 20.2% for corporate taxes.

Personal income tax also outperformed, recording an impressive 51.2% growth in Q2 compared to 11% in Q1, resulting in an excellent half-year average of 31%.

In addition, the core sector showed a significant improvement, growing by 9.68% in Q2, a noticeable improvement from the 6% growth seen in Q1.

To sum it up, the tax data, along with the core sector performance, suggests that the governor's prediction of the second-quarter GDP exceeding the RBI's forecast of 6.5% may be accurate.

CNBC-TV18 conducted a snap poll, which found that 60% of economists have recently revised their Q2 GDP forecasts to approximately 6.7-6.8%. They cited strong tax numbers, favourable corporate results, and the surprising resilience of the US economy, which grew by 4.9% in the July-September quarter.

If Q2 GDP exceeds expectations, it raises questions about whether the full-year GDP forecast will also need to be revised upward. However, concerns remain about the potential impact of higher Fed interest rates on the US and global economies. To discuss these questions, CNBC-TV18's Latha Venkatesh interviewed three well-known economists: Pranjul Bhandari of HSBC, Kaushik Das of Deutsche Bank, and Nikhil Gupta of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

The decision, which came in line with the market expectation, was taken in the November policy meeting.

In a statement released by BoE, the bank’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) indicated that inflation is set to fall towards a 2% target rate over the coming year. In the year to September, inflation stood at 6.7%.

The central bank last month broke the cycle of interest rate hikes by resisting market expectations for a 25-basis-point hike. The September decision came on the heels of a series of 14 consecutive rate hikes that commenced back in December 2021, when the interest rates were at a mere 0.1%.

The BoE unfurled a cycle of rate hikes to counter price rise issues that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic followed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy costs.

With inflation cooling down, central banks across the world are resisting interest rate hikes. The US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) have also held interest rates over the past week.

60,CNBC,RBI moving towards principle-based regulation: Deputy Governor M Rajeshwar Rao,https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/reserve-bank-of-india-rbi-moving-towards-principle-based-regulation-m-rajeshwar-rao-18225741.htm,"Nov 2, 2023 6:00 PM","Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor M Rajeshwar Rao emphasised the crucial role of regulations in ensuring the stability and growth of the financial sector in a speech made at the Gatekeepers of Governance Summit organised by ‘Excellence Enablers’ in Mumbai.

Share Market Live NSE

The Deputy Governor cited historical examples of how minimal regulation, coupled with lenient supervision, has often led to financial crises. Rao argued that nothing could be more detrimental to sustainable growth than a malfunctioning banking and financial sector. In an ideal world, the ""invisible hand"" would manage the financial system effectively with minimal regulatory oversight. In reality, regulatory oversight becomes necessary to prevent irrational exuberance and maintain financial stability.

Speaking about the structural shifts that are reshaping the financial sector, Rao said that these transitions encompass a wide range of factors, each presenting its unique set of challenges. Climate change emerged as a significant concern, said Deputy Governor Rao, highlighting the imperative need for regulators to integrate climate risks into regulatory frameworks. Balancing environmental responsibility with managing credit flow is a formidable task that requires collaborative solutions.

Rao emphasised the need for regulatory frameworks to evolve alongside technological advancements to ensure the security, privacy, and integrity of the financial system. He cited the recent enactment of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act in India as a critical step in safeguarding individuals' rights and responsible data handling.

The rise of digital intermediation, exemplified by digital lending platforms, presented new challenges, the Deputy Governor said. Rao raised the question of whether regulators should proactively establish regulatory frameworks for financial innovations or adopt a more relaxed approach, allowing markets to develop naturally. While intervention is necessary to address issues like high-interest loans and exploitation of regulatory gaps, the challenge lies in determining the extent of regulatory intervention while preserving fintech-led innovation.

“For a regulator, inaction can never be an option. The pace with which newer business models, players and products are coming up, with such entities often exploiting the gaps in existing regulations or conducting business operations that fall in a regulatory grey area, continues to be a challenge. The business models that are built to challenge the regulatory perimeters, aggressive marketing strategies, and those that are engaged in exploitation of gullible customers makes it clear that such issues need intervention. But, the dilemma lies in deciding the extent of regulatory intervention which will contain and restrict the customer abuse without significantly altering the nature of FinTech led innovation,” Rao said.

On the impact of social media on the financial sector, Rao cited the recent banking turmoil in the United States, where the speed of bank runs and misinformation spread through social media posed significant challenges.

Deputy Governor Rao outlined the RBI's approach to managing these transitions, emphasising the need to simplify regulations. He mentioned the establishment of the Regulations Review Authority 2.0 (RRA) in 2021 to review and streamline regulations, making them more responsive to the evolving needs of the financial system.

Rao also touched upon the ongoing debate between principle-based and rule-based regulations, noting the RBI's gradual shift towards principle-based regulations, which provide flexibility while emphasising desired outcomes. “The benefit of rules-based regulations is that it provides certainty and firm guidance on what regulated entities are required to do, and from the regulator’s point of view, the measurable and explainable regulatory targets and responsibilities that can be easily monitored and enforced. But, in a prescriptive approach to regulation, the rules might end up becoming more important than the intended outcome for which they were designed, leading to a culture of ‘box ticking’ compliance.”

""In contrast, principle-based regulation is more like a compass, providing regulated entities with a general direction, without specifying the precise route to be taken. The principles are crafted to be suitable for a wide array of situations and emphasise on desired outcomes. They grant regulated entities the flexibility to adapt to evolving circumstances and to innovate; however, it also requires them to exercise prudent judgement and make responsible decisions. But, often, to make the regulatory expectations clear, principle-based regulations are required to be supplemented with clarifications, illustrations and guidance notes,” he said.

RBI, the deputy governor said, is moving at a good pace towards making its regulations increasingly principle-based. “The Reserve Bank, as a matter of policy, has been gradually giving banks greater operational freedom to conduct their business operations within the overarching regulatory framework,” he added.

Maintaining a level playing field is a priority for the RBI. Rao discussed the ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"" principle, which ensures that regulatory burdens are proportionate to the risks posed by entities to the financial system.

“A level playing field ensures that all participants operate within a fair and consistent regulatory framework where the potential risks and rewards of the financial system are evenly balanced. There is widespread agreement that a level playing field is a key condition for a competitive financial sector. As a regulator, we are following the principle of ‘same activity, same risk, same regulation.’ This approach can be seen in the case of our guidelines on Digital lending, First Loss Default Guarantee (FLDG) and microfinance sector,” Rao said.

He concluded, however, saying that it must also be appreciated that limiting the potential for regulatory arbitrage and establishing a level playing field for market participants is “an important objective for regulators, but it is not the overriding one”. To ensure efficient market functioning and, more broadly, to safeguard the public interest, policymakers may, at times, need to treat different players differently, he said.

Share Market Live NSE

Provisional pledges from the UAE could be announced early next year, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named as the information is not public. Any new investments would follow Narendra Modi’s meetings with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed in July.

The countries have been seeking to bolster ties over the past decade and aim to increase non-oil bilateral trade to $100 billion. Modi’s recent visit to Abu Dhabi marked his fifth trip to the Gulf nation since he took over as prime minister in 2014. The last Indian premier to visit the UAE before him was Indira Gandhi in 1981.

Deals being discussed include stakes in key Indian infrastructure projects and state-owned assets, with announcements likely before Modi seeks a third term in federal elections due next year, the people said. Some of the investments could involve sovereign wealth funds such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority , Mubadala Investment Co. and ADQ, they said.

The pledges are unlikely to have clear timelines for a large chunk of the investments, the people said. No final decisions have been made on the size or timing of the announcements.

As part of the push, entities overseen by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan have held early-stage talks on investing billions of dollars in India, one of the people said. Sheikh Tahnoon is the UAE president’s brother and chairman of International Holding Co., which disclosed a 5% stake in Gautam Adani’s flagship conglomerate last month. That came days after IHC sold down holdings in two Adani firms, though the firm reiterated its commitment to India at the time.

Representatives for India’s finance and trade ministries, the UAE government, and Sheikh Tahnoon’s private investment firm Royal Group didn’t respond to requests for comment. ADIA, ADQ, and Mubadala declined to comment.

Growth engine

Royal Group has long prized India, and executives there have called the country a potential growth engine of the next decade, Bloomberg has reported. Sheikh Tahnoon is also chairman of ADQ as well as ADIA, one of the world’s largest wealth funds, with close to $1 trillion in assets.

Lured by a rising middle class and seeking to diversify away from traditional investment destinations like Europe, Gulf state-backed investors have boosted ties with India. Others, including the Qatar Investment Authority and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, have also emerged as prominent investors in the country.

The UAE’s plan is a further indicator of the government’s push to position itself as a country that avoids taking sides in a world increasingly split between Washington and Beijing.

As one of the few countries to manage close to $1.5 trillion in sovereign wealth, the UAE is a vital ally to the world’s most populous nation, which is seeking to bridge infrastructure gaps. For India, any large foreign investments would help Prime Minister Modi highlight his efforts to bolster the economy ahead of the 2024 vote.

Earlier this year, the UAE announced plans to support Turkey’s embattled economy with a $51 billion investment pledge, including about $30 billion in energy. Talks over one deal in that sector—just one part of the broader bilateral push—have collapsed, Bloomberg News has reported."

Share Market Live NSE

Kishida said Thursday that the measures will be worth more than ¥17 trillion including the impact from tax cuts and other costs. Around ¥13.1 trillion ($87.1 billion) of spending will be funded through an extra budget, he said.

“We’re seeing the chance to transition into a new economic stage for the first time in three decades,” said Kishida. “The key here is to strengthen firms’ ability to earn, which in turn can become the source of wage hikes.”

He is set to give further details of the package in a press conference later Thursday.

Income and residential tax rebates worth ¥3.5 trillion and more than ¥1 trillion in aid for low-income households will form a key part of the package, according to local media reports.

The package is Kishida’s latest attempt to appease voters who are critical of his handling of inflation. Price growth — the fastest in decades — has outpaced pay rises.

While the package is smaller compared to others in recent pandemic years, the scale of fiscal spending indicated by draft plans obtained by Bloomberg is around twice the size expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg last month. The draft showed fiscal spending worth ¥21.8 trillion.

The extra outlays will likely add to the country’s mountain of debt, and may have little impact on voters’ opinion of Kishida.

“Part of the reason why people don’t like tax rebates much is they think they will be temporary,” said Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. “Many people may just save them as they expect taxes to go back to the same level. I also have doubts about the impact because it won’t be delivering money to people in a tangible way.”

Support for Kishida continued to slide even after he outlined the planned tax cuts and handouts.

Surveys by the Nikkei newspaper and broadcast news network ANN last week found approval for Kishida at its lowest since the premier took office two years ago, at 33% and 26.9% respectively. The Nikkei poll showed that around two-thirds of respondents viewed plans for an income tax reduction in the package as inappropriate.

The income tax cuts are set to be ¥30,000 per person, and the residential tax rebate ¥10,000 per person, according to local media reports. They won’t start until June next year, a delay that may frustrate households seeking quick relief from inflation.

The package comes with Kishida yet to make clear how he will fund bigger-ticket initiatives such as boosting spending for defense, and countering the declining birthrate. There’s also simmering discontent within Kishida’s own ruling party, with one senior member telling parliament that the premier lacks leadership, in an unusual display of disunity.

“Higher wages would be the biggest help for households,” S&P’s Taguchi said. “The government should focus on helping companies create an environment where companies find it easy to raise wages.”

With his latest package, Kishida aims to also spur future growth, rather than just boost sagging demand now. At least some of the measures are expected to help push up wages among firms, and add to support for domestic investment into semiconductors, according to the documents obtained by Bloomberg.

Fueling growth in the economy instead of relying on borrowing has been a challenge for years as Japan’s economy struggled to end deflation.

Achieving that transition to stronger growth is key for the heavily indebted nation’s fiscal health. So far Japan’s general government debt has grown to a size equivalent to 255% of its economy, according to the International Monetary Fund.

The switch is all the more urgent, as the country is at a potential inflection point where the central bank is gradually letting interest rates rise, a factor that would ramp up borrowing costs for the government."

In an exclusive interaction with CNBC-TV18 during his first visit to India as Leader of Opposition, Dutton outlined that critical minerals and defence manufacturing are also areas where both nations could cooperate under the proposed Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).

India and Australia had signed an Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement in December last year under which the nations have decided to give tariff free access to each other’s goods for 85-96% of product lines. The trade gap between India and Australia has come down by 15% since the signing of the ECTA and both sides are now close to concluding talks on the CECA.

Dutton said that the diaspora and strong people-to-people ties were the basis for the close economic cooperation between the two countries. The Leader of Opposition, who has also served as Minister for Defence, said China's aggression was a cause for concern and cannot be accepted.

""We have a deep trading relationship with China and we want that relationship to grow. But China under Xi is a different China. We have seen Chinese aggression with the Philippines, in the South China sea and land border with India. The common ingredient between India and Australia is that China’s aggressive approach should not be accepted"", he said.

Speaking about the Israel-Hamas war, Dutton said the conflict was a test of Western leadership and the West must stand up to Hamas the way it did against Russia in the Ukraine war.

Contrarian Views on Indian Consumption

Kamath's stance on India's consumption story may seem contrarian compared to the prevailing sentiment, but he said it is founded on a global perspective. He acknowledges that India's economic growth, like many parts of the world, has faced challenges due to higher global interest rates. The United States and Europe have seen signs of economic slowdown, and the world watches India in relative terms. From this standpoint, Kamath believes that India's growth has not been as negatively impacted as other major economies.

Kamath also credited the Indian government for effectively marketing the India story to the world over the past decade. The narrative that has been crafted by the government has painted India as an attractive investment destination, and this positive perception has contributed to the country's resilience in the face of global economic challenges, Kamath said.

Impact of Interest Rates

Interest rates play a pivotal role in economic performance. While the US has seen a substantial increase in interest rates, India has also witnessed rate hikes, albeit to a lesser extent. Kamath acknowledged that these interest rate increases may not have yet had a significant impact on consumption, but he cautioned that the higher cost of capital, if sustained, is likely to lead to a slowdown in consumption across various sectors, starting with real estate.

Relative Performance Matters

Kamath's assessment centered around the concept of relative performance. While India may face challenges, as long as it continues to fare better than other global economies, it is in a strong position, he said, adding that comparison with other slowing economies puts India's performance in a more positive light.

Investment Strategies

When asked about his investment strategies and the sectors he's eyeing, Kamath emphasised the need for India to allocate more resources towards research and intellectual property (IP) creation. He said he believes that much of the innovation and IP generation is still happening outside of India, and the country should shift its focus towards fostering more homegrown innovation.

Kamath also commented on the ongoing transition in the automotive sector, where electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining prominence. He highlighted the competition between established industry giants and new players like Ola Electric, based in Bangalore. This sector represents a dynamic growth opportunity, and Kamath suggests that keeping a close watch on EV developments is a wise investment move — will legacy players cash in, or will it be upstarts like Ola, Ather, etc?

In conclusion, Kamath emphasised the importance of relative performance, the impact of interest rates on consumption, and the need for India to focus on creating intellectual property. The discussion highlights the dynamic nature of the Indian market and the opportunities it presents for investors and businesses alike."

Maceda was speaking at the IBLA Jury meeting alongside other IBLA Jury members such as Standard Chartered Bank's Zarin Daruwala, Mahindra Group's Anish Shah, Federal Bank's Shyam Srinivasan, HUL's Rohit Jawa, CaratLane's Mithun Sacheti, Olympic Champion Abhinav Bindra, Meta India's Sandhya Devanathan and Zerodha's Nikhil Kamath.

""W e have to see from a bit of a wider arc because we look at the per capita consumption across all categories. that we play in a large swath of categories, we are very, very diversified, and we are still, you know, 1/6 of neighbouring countries,"" said Hindustan Unilever's Rohit Jawa.

He added that there are huge amounts of opportunity in growing consumption. ""So, I think the many forces such as digitisation, the access to information, the access transportation, drive the consuming class, wanting to upgrade, all of that hunger to have a better quality of life. All of that is in scale in India. It is going to be and is the best consumer story of this decade, and we've just started seeing it play out. If you look back five years, the middle class and above has doubled, and we expect that to double again. And that itself, you know, they consume at a much higher factor of consumption one or two times. So, we will see a huge amount of breakthrough and consumption.""

According to Jawa, India cannot focus on a few quarters of inflation, deflation, because that's really a small sliver in the larger arc of the country's trajectory. ""We are very, very as Hindustan Unilever, very optimistic, we have been here 90 years, and we have seen this our business and our country, go from strength to strength, and I think the best is yet to come.""

""We have to build different kinds of supply chains, we have to think about which countries are allied and that creates opportunities for India,"" Maceda said adding that as the world continues to decarbonise, India should try to build a transition towards greener energy that creates opportunities for the country.

On digital transformation, the Bain & Company CEO said that digital transformation around the world is creating opportunities for India.

""The Indian business community, as well as the government, is enabling capture for all of these opportunities to create both opportunities for inside India resurgence, but as well as the helping India play a place in this world that's much more meaningful than it's been.""

Maceda pointed out that global risks change how companies make their decisions. Listing down all the unpredictability that happened in the last five years — global pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East — Maceda said that the risks might actually act in favour of the country.

""M any of those might actually play if India handles itself, right, both the government and the businesses to create opportunity. And so it's weird to say that participating in India more as a global company might actually be a risk management strategy."""
71,CNBC,Zoomed Out | Why redistribution of unpaid care work is a prerequisite to achieve women empowerment,https://www.cnbctv18.com/india/india-nari-shakti-womens-reservation-bill-redistribution-of-unpaid-care-work-a-prerequisite-to-achieve-women-empowerment-18199441.htm,"Nov 1, 2023 1:04 PM","In recent times, Indian policy dialogues have shifted from development of women to women leading the country’s development. This is envisaged through the realisation of their power or ‘Nari Shakti’, a term popularised by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Building on this vision, the G20 New Delhi Leader’s Declaration included the setting up of a Working Group on the Empowerment of Women. ‘Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam’ or the Women’s Reservation Bill that seeks to provide 33% reservation to women in Lok Sabha and State Assemblies has also been introduced to increase women’s political representation in the country.

But can women be at the forefront of development, while most of them are excessively burdened with unpaid care work? The socially constructed heteronormative gender roles in the society view women as caregivers and secondary earners, while men are viewed as the providers. This helps perpetuate the unequal distribution of unpaid care work. On an average, women in India spend 7.2 hours in a day on cooking, cleaning, and care for their household members (child, elderly, sick or disabled) as opposed to 2.8 hours spent by men.

Women who are engaged in paid work, spend double the amount of time on unpaid care than men engaged in paid work. The intensity of work and the time spent increases with poverty and other forms of marginalities. Unequal distribution of unpaid care work creates a hierarchy that reinforces gender power dynamics within the domestic and public sphere. This becomes a key contributor to gender inequality and therefore an impediment to realising ‘Nari Shakti.’

Care is essential for households and societies to function. However, the disproportionate responsibility of unpaid care work on women results in time poverty that impacts their ability to progress in education and join paid work. This also affects the quality of care provided, thus leading to poor outcomes for families and societies at large.

Women’s excessive unpaid care work responsibilities are a determining factor in the low female labour force participation of the country (32.8%). Their care work responsibilities limit women’s opportunities and choices for economic, social, and political participation and affects their health, happiness, and overall life satisfaction. Poor public infrastructure and the impact of climate change further adds to the unpaid care work of women especially of those belonging to poor and marginalised sections as the procurement of resources takes more time.

The perceived role of women in the domestic sphere has implications on their engagement outside it as well. They face discrimination in almost all sectors of employment in terms of wages, working conditions, employer bias, and lack of upward mobility. About 82% of the total number of working women in India are employed in the informal sector that is characterised by low job security, nominal social security entitlements, inadequate regulations as well as high chances of exploitation and violence at workplace.

Further, even in the domain of paid work, care jobs are feminised. Domestic workers, Anganwadi workers, ASHA workers and agricultural workers are primarily women. They continue to remain undervalued and underpaid. Anganwadi workers and ASHA are paid an honorarium that is often less than the minimum wage. They are referred to as ‘volunteers’ despite having clear work deliverables.

The vision of Nari Shakti and women-led development can hit a roadblock if unequal distribution of unpaid care responsibilities is not recognised, redistributed, and reduced. Adequate provision of institutional care facilities for childcare, disability care, or elderly care, will contribute to reducing the unpaid care work responsibilities of women.

Additionally, building of public assets and infrastructure that alleviate unpaid care work for example doorstep provision of clean water, fuel and electricity can be done under employment guarantee programs,this will provide the dual benefit of reducing overhead time of poor households while performing unpaid care work as well as providing productive employment. Laws that enable an equal participation of men in unpaid care must also be introduced. Additionally, paid care work must be dignified, and the care workers must be ensured of decent work conditions. This would contribute to transformed perceptions around unpaid care work as well.

Some positive steps have been taken in the country to reduce the childcare responsibilities of women. Under the Palna scheme , the Ministry of Women and Child Development aims to open 17000 anganwadi cum creches and 170 standalone creches by the financial year 2025-26. Haryana has become the first state to launch a creche policy in July 2023, thus developing a model for other states to follow. While these are laudable initiatives, the aim should be to move towards universalisation of creches that will require setting up enough creches to meet the demand on ground.

The World Economic Forum report released in 2023 estimates that at the current rate of change the gender gap in economic participation and opportunity will take 131 years to close. Addressing unpaid care work can help accelerate the process of closing this gap by contributing to better education, skill enhancement, increased labour force participation, well-being, and life satisfaction for women. The disproportionate burden of unpaid care work must be addressed through the provision of public services, infrastructure, social protection policies, and the promotion of shared responsibility within households. This is a prerequisite for realisation of women-led development.

Share Market Live NSE

“Participants generally judged that, with the stance of monetary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achievement of the committee’s goals had become more two-sided,” according to minutes of the September meeting, released in Washington Wednesday.

Also Read:

“All participants” agreed that the committee was in a position to “proceed carefully” and that policy decisions would be data-dependent and take into account “the balance of risks.”

“They’re going to be parked on the side, but they’re not unpacking their bags just yet,” said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “They’re seeing inflation as unacceptably high — and that there are more upside risks,” she added.

At the meeting, Fed officials held their benchmark lending rate at a range of 5.25-5.5% last month , and signaled rates would stay higher for longer than previously expected following one more rate increase this year.

Since then, a surge in long-term Treasury yields has prompted some policymakers to suggest they may hold off on another hike when they meet on October 31 - November 1, as they parse the reasons behind the run-up.

After the minutes were published, the Fed-policy sensitive two-year Treasury yield and the dollar pared the day’s gains, while the S&P 500 Index pared losses.

The minutes noted that “a majority” of Fed officials saw one more rate increase “would likely be appropriate” to help cool off demand and get inflation closer to their 2% inflation target over the next two years, while “some” said “no further increases would be warranted.”

In forecasts issued last month, 12 of 19 officials projected one more hike this year, while the median estimate showed they expected fewer rate cuts in 2024 and 2025.

“Participants generally noted that it was important to balance the risk of overtightening against the risk of insufficient tightening,” the minutes said.

Omair Sharif of Inflation Insights said the future of policy remains in a “tug-of-war” between the two risks. “The committee will proceed carefully,” he said Wednesday in a note to clients, adding that most “aren’t yet confident that inflation is on a durable and sustainable path to 2%.”

The estimated higher rate peak, coupled with a slower pace of reductions in the next two years, sent bond markets reeling over the past three weeks. Yields on US 10-year notes jumped as much as 40 basis points from the September 20 meeting through Monday, while spreads on corporate credit widened and broader financial conditions tightened.

The rapid increase in borrowing costs appears to have surprised some officials on the Federal Open Market Committee, who suggested they may again keep rates unchanged when officials meet in three weeks.

Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson on Monday told a conference that he would “remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields” in assessing “the future path of policy.” And Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said the same day that higher yields may lessen the need for further rate increases.

Bond markets rallied after those comments and futures markets were pricing in about a 10% chance of a quarter-point rate increase at the next Fed meeting.

Other Fed speakers on Wednesday advocated for a cautious approach on future moves.

Governor Christopher Waller said the Fed can watch and see what happens before taking further action with interest rates as financial markets tighten. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the central bank doesn’t need to keep raising interest rates unless inflation’s descent starts to stall.

The minutes noted that the economy is expanding at a solid pace, labor markets were reaching a better balance, and inflation — while it has cooled — is still running above target. The Dallas Fed, which trims away outlier prices from the personal consumption expenditures price index, calculated the six-month annual inflation rate at 3.1% for August, down from 3.4% in July.

Fed officials estimate they need to get economic growth below the 1.8% trend rate to slow price increases."

Here are key highlights.

Expanding investor base in securities market

Governor Das highlighted the RBI's efforts over the past few years to expand the investor base in the securities market, with a particular emphasis on Government Securities (GSecs). He noted that the inclusion of India in the J.P. Morgan bond index is a vote of confidence in India's economy and financial markets. He recognised that passive investors, influenced by index weightage, can cause both inflows and outflows, but he reiterated the RBI's track record in handling such situations.

Governor Das discussed India's macroeconomic stability and the country's increasing contribution to world economic growth, stating that India is expected to become the third-largest economy globally. As a result, he emphasised the need for the Indian Rupee to have a more prominent presence in international transactions, especially in trade with India's partners. However, he clarified that this isn't an attempt to challenge the dominance of the US Dollar but rather to enhance India's global footprint.

Cryptocurrencies and financial stability

Governor Das reiterated his oft-repeated serious concerns about cryptocurrencies, highlighting their potential threat to financial stability, especially in emerging market economies. He referenced an IMF paper that suggests countries might need to impose additional restrictions on cryptocurrencies as necessary. He called for a comprehensive perspective on the macroeconomic stability risks posed by cryptocurrencies and questioned their larger purpose compared to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

Bank Governance and IT Systems

Discussing the health of the Indian banking sector and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), Governor Das assured that both are currently robust and healthy at aggregate and individual levels. He attributed this stability to the focus on good governance, emphasising that underlying financial numbers must not mask basic deficiencies. He stressed the RBI's commitment to working with banks to address issues and maintain their stability. He also mentioned that the RBI pays close attention to bank IT systems and encourages corrective measures when necessary.

Private sector bank salaries and core team building

Governor Das clarified the RBI's role in approving compensation packages for Whole Time Directors (WTD) of private banks. He noted that beyond setting fixed to variable pay ratios, the RBI does not interfere in private bankers' compensations. High attrition rates in certain private banks are also a point of scrutiny, with Governor Das suggesting it's the responsibility of each bank to build a core team that stays with it. He highlighted the stricter norms for upper-layer NBFCs due to their size and complexity.

Geopolitical risks and economic growth

Geopolitical risks, according to Governor Das, pose the most significant threat to global growth. However, he expressed confidence in India's ability to deal with such challenges effectively. On a positive note, Governor Das expected India's Q2 GDP numbers to surpass forecasts, potentially surprising everyone on the upside.

Lastly, when asked for his message to the financial sector stakeholders, Das ended with, “Please play long term, play like Rahul Dravid.”"

Congress leader wears garland of onions

Congress leader Ragini Nayak on Sunday wore a garland of onions to highlight the escalating prices of onions and criticised both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments at the Centre and in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh for the distress caused by soaring onion prices.

""The price of onion has shot up to ₹ 80 per kilogram. Some days back, the price of tomato was ₹ 200- ₹ 250 per kg. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should tell us why the price of onion is leaving people distressed,"" the Congress spokesperson said.

₹ 47 per kg, the Centre on Friday decided to ₹ 25 per kg in retail markets in order to provide relief to consumers. As the all-India average retail onion price shot up by 57% to47 per kg, the Centre on Friday decided to step up the sale of buffer onion at a subsidised rate of25 per kg in retail markets in order to provide relief to consumers.

Nayak emphasised that this issue is not an isolated one, as the price of wheat flour has witnessed a 35% increase in Madhya Pradesh over the past year. Edible oil costs have doubled in the last three years, and Goods and Services Tax has been imposed on milk, ghee, and paneer, all of which have a significant impact on the average citizen, she added.

Nayak also pointed out that while the general public is grappling with the consequences of price hikes, it is equally detrimental to farmers. She highlighted that farmers in the Shajapur district are forced to sell onions for a mere ₹ 2 per kilogram, whereas consumers in the same region are purchasing onions for ₹ 80 per kilogram.

In the face of dwindling onion supplies, retail prices have surged to ₹ 65- ₹ 80 per kilogram in the national capital. Popular retail chains like Mother Dairy and e-commerce platforms such as Bigbasket and Otipy are selling onions in the range of ₹ 67 to ₹ 70 per kilogram, while local vendors are offering them at ₹ 80 per kilogram.

According to experts, the soaring prices of onions are primarily attributed to hoarding, leading to a shortage in supply and elevated prices. Rishu Arora, the chairman of Ludhiana's New Vegetable Market in Punjab, told Hindustan Times, ""The main reason behind this surge is that people are stockpiling onions in the market, causing a scarcity and driving prices up. If steps are not taken to control this, prices could reach ₹120-150 per kilogram in the coming months.""

Congress v. BJP

Drawing attention to a remark made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Nayak stated that when questioned about the escalating onion prices, the minister remarked that she does not consume onions. This, according to Nayak, exemplifies the lack of concern displayed by the BJP-led governments at both the central and state levels towards the issues faced by the people.

Nayak nostalgically recalled a time when, under the Congress's leadership, people could carry money in their wallets and return with bags full of vegetables.

""Under the Congress, people used to go with money in their wallets and buy a bag full of vegetables. Now, they take money in a bag and return with vegetables in a wallet,"" she said.

It is worth noting that Madhya Pradesh is on the cusp of assembly elections, with polling scheduled for November 17 and vote counting set to take place on December 3.

Effective October 29-December 31, the government has imposed a $800 per metric tonne MEP to keep onions at an affordable price. The decision, announced by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, also includes the procurement of an additional 2 lakh tonnes of onions for the buffer, augmenting the 5 lakh tonnes already in stock. Notably, the MEP applies to all varieties of onions, except for Bangalore Rose and Krishnapuram onions, as well as cut, sliced, or broken onions in powdered form.

Looked at in the context of Murthy’s broader point, it would seem that this was more an impassioned statement to stir up a sense of commitment to the nation than a directional suggestion. The gist of Murthy’s argument is that India finds itself in a good place today, and the country should seize the moment to shape its destiny. He points to how other nations harnessed the power of their youth (favourable demographics for India) to great effect. He chides the youth today for being distracted and adopting what’s bad in the West, not what’s good. He calls for the youth to rise to the occasion and commit to working harder and longer to help the nation to achieve its goals.

The 70-hour workweek expression seems to have been made more in this context. Else, it doesn’t make sense. We’ll get to why.

70-hour workweek, a conditional call?

What some seem to have missed, seems to be Murthy’s less emphasised but notable comment on corruption. While his words were carefully chosen, he did mention that corruption needed to be weeded out. In fact, that’s been one of the key reasons holding back India’s progress. Not just corruption at high levels, but corruption at all levels. India ranks 85 out of 180 countries in the Corruption Perceptions Index. Unless you weed out corruption, you can’t instil confidence in the youth that their efforts will go towards bettering their future.

The youth of today, given the vast amount of information available to all across social media, are far more aware. You cannot expect them to follow a path that they can clearly see the “leaders of today” are themselves not willing to embrace. It isn’t as easy for leaders today to hide their deeds. To lead, they will have to lead by example.

Also, despite the progress in the formalisation of India’s economy, there remains a large cash economy outside the purview. Even today, if you pay cash, you can avoid the GST levy. What’s more, less than 7% of India’s adult population pays taxes. The inequitable contribution of people to the nation’s growth is another hindrance in stirring up the national spirit.

70 hours will not up productivity

It is important to distinguish between the labour productivity of a nation and revenue per employee for an organisation to appreciate the difference. Productivity for a country is measured as the gross domestic product or output generated per hour of work—or GDP/ hour. Hence, an increase in the number of hours worked, will not lead to any change in productivity.

The productivity of a nation depends on several factors. One among these is the nature of work. India having a large section of its population employed in low-productivity sectors like agriculture does skew the comparison. For an economy, investment in capital (equipment), technology and human capital (education and skilling) are the key factors that drive productivity. So, doing extra hours will not change the picture—it will be more output with the same or likely lesser productivity. Interestingly, Ireland with a 39-hour work week and Norway with a 40-hour work week have productivities of over $100/ hour, the highest in the world.

Labout Productivyty (2019) Country GDP/hour Australia $61.4 Brazil $19.2 China $11.7 France $68.6 Germany $68.9 India $8.7 Indonesia $11.8 Ireland $125.1 Norway $100.3 Russia $29.5 South Korea $40.8 Taiwan $46.0 United Kingdom $54.3 United States $73.7 Source: Our World in Data

For businesses, the more commonly used parameter is revenue per employee. Here, you divide the total revenue of the organisation by the number of employees. So, if the revenue increases without an increase in the number of employees, the revenue per employee will rise. Extra hours can help achieve this, but will an increase in hours also spell an increase in employee costs? That remains the important question.

However, even in organisations, productivity improvements come from more effective utilisation of human capital, better management practices, technology-led improved efficiencies and other such factors. It has been demonstrated by various studies that productivity levels in large organisations are higher than in small businesses. Also, productivity levels vary vastly across sectors. Generally, productivity levels in services are higher than in manufacturing, so comparing disparate businesses on productivity is not meaningful.

A nation-building call

Interestingly, Narayana Murthy’s comment on the 70-hour work week also drew a statement from Sajjan Jindal, Chairman, JSW Group: “We have to make India an economic superpower that we can all be proud of in 2047. A five-day week culture is not what a rapidly developing nation of our size needs. Our PM Narendra Modi ji works over 14-16 hours every day. My father used to work 12-14 hours, seven days a week. I work 10-12 hours every day. We have to find passion in our work and in nation-building.”

Clearly, the accent from both business leaders is on nation-building and committing to working harder for a common cause, more than work hours or productivity. By his own admission, Jindal works fewer hours than his father did, but his productivity levels are likely to be significantly higher."

The measure has been undertaken to maintain sufficient availability of onions for domestic consumers at affordable prices as the quantity of the stored rabi crop of onions is declining, and the move is aimed to curb the quantity of onion exports.

The MEP of $800 per MT translates into about ₹ 67/kg.

The Union Government has also announced the procurement of additional 2 lakh tons of onion for the buffer, over and above the 5 lakh tons already procured.

Onion from the buffer stock has been disposed off continuously from the second week of August in major consumption centres all over the country, as well as supplied to retail consumers at ₹ 25/kg through mobile vans operated by National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India Limited (NCCF) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited (NAFED).

The all-India average retail price of onion rose to Rs 47 per kg on Friday, from Rs 30 per kg in the year-ago period, as per the data maintained by the Consumer Affairs Ministry.

In the national capital, the retail price of onion was at Rs 40/kg on Friday as against Rs 30/kg in the year-ago period, the data showed.

""We have been offloading buffer onions since mid-August and we are stepping up the retail sale in order to check further rise in prices and provide relief to the consumers,"" Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh told PTI.

According to the ministry, onion is being offloaded from the buffer stock in both wholesale and retail markets in states where there is a sharp rise in prices. Since mid-August, about 1.7 lakh tonnes of buffer onion has been offloaded in 22 states at different locations.

In retail markets, buffer onion is being offloaded through two cooperative bodies NCCF and NAFED outlets and vehicles at a subsidised rate of Rs 25 per kg. In Delhi too, buffer onion is being sold at this subsidised rate.

A senior ministry official said the delay in kharif onion sowing due to weather reasons has resulted in less coverage and late arrival of the crop. The fresh kharif onion should have started arriving by now but it has not.

With stored rabi onion getting exhausted and delay in the arrival of Kharif onion, there is a tight supply situation, resulting in price increases in both wholesale and retail markets, the official added.

He also mentioned that the government has doubled the buffer onion stock for the current year and this should improve domestic availability and check prices in the coming days.

For the 2023-24 fiscal year, the consumer affairs ministry through NCCF and NAFED has maintained a buffer onion stock of 5 lakh tonnes and plans to procure an additional 2 lakh tonnes of onion in the coming days."

Share Market Live NSE

The data reveals a consistent upward trend in the number of Income Tax Returns (ITRs ) filed by individual taxpayers. Over the past decade, the number of ITR filings has increased significantly, reaching 6.37 crore in Assessment Year (AY) 2021-22, representing a substantial 90% increase from 3.36 crore in AY 2013-14.

For AY 2023-24, the numbers continue to rise, with 7.41 crore ITRs filed, including an encouraging 53 lakh new first-time filers. This surge demonstrates a notable expansion of the taxpayer base, primarily driven by various reform measures introduced by the Department to simplify the tax process.

Notably, the increase in individual taxpayer compliance is not limited to one income range but extends across various brackets of gross total income. In the income range up to ₹ 5 lakh, the number of returns filed by individual taxpayers increased from 2.62 crore in AY 2013-14 to 3.47 crore in AY 2021-22, indicating a 32% growth. This range of income includes individuals having income below taxable limit who may not be filing returns.

Moreover, the data reveals substantial increases in ITRs filed by individual taxpayers with gross total income in the ranges of Rs. 5 lakh to ₹ 10 lakh and ₹ 10 lakh to ₹ 25 lakh, growing by 295% and 291%, respectively, from AY 2013-14 to AY 2021-22. This suggests a positive trend in individual taxpayers' movement towards higher income brackets.

A deeper analysis of the gross total income for individual taxpayers in AY 2013-14 and AY 2021-22 reveals several important findings:

The proportionate contribution of gross total income from the top 1% of individual taxpayers, compared to all individual taxpayers, decreased from 15.9% in AY 2013-14 to 14.6% in AY 2021-22.

The proportionate contribution of gross total income from the bottom 25% of individual taxpayers increased from 8.3% in AY 2013-14 to 8.4% in AY 2021-22.

The proportion of gross total income from the middle 74% group of individual taxpayers increased from 75.8% to 77% during the same period.

In addition to these encouraging trends, the average gross total income for individual taxpayers has witnessed an overall increase of 56%, rising from around ₹ 4.5 lakh in AY 2013-14 to approximately ₹ 7 lakh in AY 2021-22.

The increase in average gross total income for the top 1% of individual taxpayers is 42%, while for the bottom 25% of individual taxpayers, it is an impressive 58%.

These statistics underscore robust income growth among individuals across different income groups since AY 2013-14, culminating in a substantial rise in net direct tax collections.

Net direct tax collections have surged from ₹ 6.38 lakh crore in the financial year 2013-14 to an impressive ₹ 16.61 lakh crore in the financial year 2022-23.

This significant progress can be attributed to the government's taxpayer-friendly and progressive policies, which aim to ensure transparency, efficiency, and trust-building efforts with taxpayers and stakeholders, Ministry of Finance said in a statement."

T he snacks industry is now seeking clarity from the government on the status of namkeen, fryums and snacks after a slew of DGGI notices, sources told CNBC-TV18 .

Share Market Live NSE

“DGGI has sent notices to industry players seeking GST at 18%. The industry is of the view that namkeen and related snacks should be treated at 12% GST under HSN Code 2106 and the uncooked and unfried snack pellets attract 5% GST,” they added.

The industry is basing its stance on the 2012 Supreme Court ruling in an excise regime-related case between the government and Pepsi Foods Ltd on Kurkure, where the apex court classified it as namkeen. After the Supreme Court order, Pepsi Foods and other industry players have been filing GST under the Namkeen category at 12%.

However, sources say that “DGGI is of a view that select namkeen and snacks such as chips attract 12%, and other namkeen and snacks which are treated as fryums or snacks cooked and involving extrusion process attracts 18% GST.”

This category has products such as Bhujia, Kurkure, Cheetos, select varieties under Bingo etc, which are treated as namkeen, snacks with process of extrusion, thus should be treated at 18%.

The confusion over the GST classification has been an issue for both the government and the industry. The CBIC circular in January 2023 clarified that snack pellets such as fryums etc made after the process of extrusion are to be classified, under HSN Code 1905 and will attract 18% GST. Not just this, another circular issued in August 2023 said that uncooked and unfried snack pellets would attract 5% GST.

Some of the impacted industry players are PepsiCo, Haldirams, ITC, Pratap Snacks, Bhikaji, Bikano, etc.

The key thing to watch out for is what view the government and GST Council take after considering the ongoing industry representation and what happens to the DGGI notices that have been issued.

Experts note ambiguity in this regard and suggest the GST Council to provide adequate clarification as the way forward.

“The endeavour of the GST council and the select committee report for rates was to levy a lower rate for essential products such as food products. The higher rate of 18% for snacks which involves extrusion process leads to disparity in taxing namkeen and snacks. In other words, there is a lack of intelligible differential to impose a higher rate of tax based on an essential process which is required to prepare such snacks”, said Abhishek A Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers, who has argued before the writ court on the differential rate of the product when it leads to arbitrariness.

“Fixation of the tax rate is certainly a policy decision of the legislature. But when such a policy decision is arbitrary, vague, or leads to absurd results, the decision may have to cross the test of constitutional validity”, he added.

""The ready-to-eat food processing industry is one of the fastest-growing in India. Moreover, the industry is very dynamic and has an ever-evolving product line, and thus is subject to varied challenges under GST law, particularly classification. The classification and tax rate of certain processed food items such as namkeen, bhujia, snacks, and similar edible food items have been a contentious issue since the introduction of GST, and multiple changes have also brought in the tax schedule in relation to the same from time to time. The law specifies definite GST rates for namkeen, bhujia, chabena and similar edible preparation (in packaged and labelled form, and otherwise) as well as un-fried/ un-cooked snack pellets; however, there is a lack of clarity as to which all products would get classified under these heads, for instance, chips, packed samosa, mathri etc. Accordingly, the industry has been taking different tax positions in terms of tax rates of such items, keeping in view the recipe, trade parlance, method of preparation, etc., and have thus been subjected to scrutiny by DGGI authorities in the recent past. It is therefore imperative that adequate clarification is provided by the GST council in terms of the classification and rates for the above ready-to-eat food items which shall provide sufficient relief to the industry and settle the debate on this issue,"" says Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner, EY."

The previous month of August also saw sales grow 9%. While the industry has begun to see some greenshoots in demand, some retailers continue to flag muted consumer sentiment.

From a category standpoint, jewellery sales grew 13% as buying picks up around the festive season. Sales of consumer durables and electronics grew nine percent, while beauty, wellness and personal sales also grew 9%.

With festivities largely moving to October and November, categories that usually see an uptick in sales around this period saw only single digit sales. Apparel sales for instance were up 8%, while footwear sales grew just 4%. Meanwhile, food & grocery sales were up 14%.

While a single digit growth in sales have been on the back of a high base, retailers too have been flagging off a weak consumer sentiment leading to lower discretionary spending over the past few quarters.

Shoppers Stop, while reporting its Q2FY24 results also flagged off weak demand but said that there are some greenshoots being seen in September. On the Q2 analyst call, newly appointed Kavindra Mishra, ED & CEO, said demand was also impacted by the adhik maas (thirteenth month of a lunar year) , where consumers tend to put off purchases, and the fact that the festive period largely shifted to Q3, along with the wedding season.

However, he added, that the demand environment remains weak across cities, towns and categories unlike last year when it was more driven by rural.

RAI said that there is anticipation among retailers of an uptick in purchases in the run up to Diwali and that retailers are betting big on the season to drive growth. In addition, the cricket season is helping in sales of sports goods, which saw a growth of 14 percent.

This pressing issue has raised red flags within the nation's economic landscape, prompting a thorough examination of the potential risks associated with this rapid expansion.

Share Market Live NSE

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor has been issuing persistent warnings to banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and fintechs regarding the alarming surge in unsecured loans.

Deputy Governor Swaminathan recently disclosed staggering statistics, revealing that unsecured credit has been growing at a remarkable rate of 23% over the last couple of years, far surpassing other lending categories, which have been growing at a more modest 12-14%.

Worryingly, data from the Credit Information Bureau of India Ltd (CIBIL) indicates that non-performing assets (NPAs) in the category of loans valued at less than ₹ 50,000 have surged to 5.4% as of June 2023, a sharp increase from 4.2% a year ago. Additionally, the number of individuals with four loans in this category has seen a significant uptick.

A panel of experts including Jairam Sridharan, Jairam Sridharan, MD of Piramal Finance, Krishnan Sitaraman, Senior Director and Chief Ratings Officer at CRISIL Ratings, and Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Advisor at State Bank of India (SBI), discussed the severity of the unsecured loan problem.

Sridharan, expressing his apprehensions, stated, ""The worries are at the same level as when I last spoke maybe 4-5 months ago. I think there is more data now that gives more credence to what we have been thinking about. What we see today is that in the smaller ticket unsecured, risk has clearly started showing. 4-5 months ago, this was speculative. Now it is a fact.""

He further emphasized that risk increases as loan amounts decrease, stating, ""The smaller you go, the higher the risk has gone. It is expected that the smaller ticket loans will be high-risk, so that is not an issue. The worry is that it has increased.""

However, Ghosh of SBI offered a different perspective, suggesting that the concerns may not be as dire as they seem. He pointed out, ""While the concerns on this are well appreciated, I think numbers do not suggest any alarm as of now because according to bank credit data for the breakup of unsecured and secured credit, the compositional shift towards unsecured is actually not correct. It is continuing at 10%.""

Ghosh argued that both unsecured and secured loans have expanded since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sitaraman from CRISIL Ratings explained, ""If we look at the unsecured portfolio, I think we can split it into certain categories – one is the less than ₹ 50,000 ticket size, then we have the ₹ 50,000 to ₹ 8 lakh ticket size, and larger than Rs 8 lakh is the last ticket size for a personal loan. In the more than ₹ 8 lakh category, the numbers are quite steady, the delinquencies are quite under control. Where we have seen some uptick among some of the players is in less than ₹ 50,000 ticket size. We have seen delinquencies move up there.""

Under these orders, items cannot be produced, sold, traded, imported and stocked unless they bear the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) mark. These orders will come into force with effect from six months from the date of publication of the notifications, the DPIIT said.

In order to safeguard the domestic small/micro industries, ensure smooth implementation of the QCO and ease of doing business, relaxations have been granted to small/micro industries as regards to timeliness, additional nine months have been given to small industries and an additional 12 months to micro industries, the department said.

DPIIT in consultation with BIS and stakeholders has been identifying key products for notifying QCO. This has led to the initiation of development of more than 60 new QCOs covering 318 product standards.

Violation of the provision of the BIS Act can attract imprisonment of up to two years or a fine of at least Rs 2 lakh for the first offence. In case of second and subsequent offences, the fine will increase to a minimum of Rs 5 lakh and extend up to 10 times of the value of goods or articles.

Various initiatives, including the development of QCO, are being undertaken by the department to develop quality sensitisation among users and manufacturers alike. These initiatives, coupled with developing quality testing labs and product manuals, would help build a quality ecosystem in the country, it said.

Mandatory QCOs help curb the import of sub-standard products, prevent unfair trade practices and ensure the safety and well-being of consumers as well as the environment. These initiatives, coupled with the development of testing labs, product manuals, and accreditation of test labs, would aid the development of a quality ecosystem in the country.

Earlier, such orders have been issued for several goods, including smart meters, welding rods and electrodes, cookware and utensils, fire extinguishers, electric ceiling fans and domestic gas stoves."

The government's order, taken in consultation with the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and Grid India, is aimed at all gencos, including Independent Power Producers (IPPs), for timely import of coal for blending purposes as well as asks for maximising production in captive coal mines.

Share Market Live NSE

The order allows gencos to continuously review their stock position and opt for blending as per their requirements if the shortfall in domestic coal supply is more than 6%.

While reviewing the status of power supply across India, the government has observed a consistent rise in power demand coupled with an inadequate supply of domestic coal. This has resulted in the rapid depletion of coal stocks at domestic coal-based (DCB) plants.

Noting that the gap between receipt of domestic coal and consumption (which includes both domestic and an equivalent domestic of imported coal) from September 1 to October 9, 2023, was around 12 metric tons (MT), which puts an additional burden on coal-based thermal generation.

The situation was exacerbated by an 11% fall in hydropower generation in the first half of FY24, compared to the corresponding period of FY23, owing to variable monsoon rainfall. While 2 GW of hydropower capacity was lost due to damage to several dams in the recent floods in Sikkim, the reservoir levels in the northern, eastern, and southern parts of India were also lower compared to the previous year as on October 9, 2023.

Earlier this week, the Coal Ministry said that the total coal stock as of October 21 was 71.35 million tonnes (MT) as against 60.44 MT on the same day last year. While year-on-year (YoY) coal production has risen 12.73% and the current daily coal supply is higher than consumption, the Coal Ministry has said that there's already a strategy in place to ensure the normal production of coal during the current festive season. While India’s power demand in August 2023 rose 21%, much more than any other large country, the power demand in July 2023 grew by 10%, which was 40,000–50,000 MW more than the previous year on a daily basis.

On September 5, Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy, RK Singh, told CNBC TV18 that the coal stocks on pitheads were 18 MT, ample for nine days of consumption. He had said that the daily arrivals of domestic coal were less than the daily consumption as demand had outstripped production, adding that imports for blending will continue to ensure that there's no load shedding."

""..compared to the last six months, we are expecting the next six months will be better, including IT,"" said Dathi.

However, the CFO pointed out that currently, the IT sector stands out as an exception as it is experiencing a decline in hiring. This low hiring trend within the IT sector is projected to persist for the next few quarters, with potential implications for campus fresher hiring within the technology domain.

Dathi explained, "" IT companies are the only segment where we are seeing a drop in overall hiring trends because the rest of all other industries – be it banking or consumer segments, telecom, across all industries we are seeing a good trend in overall hiring.""

She further revealed that attrition backfilling within the IT sector is also decreasing. This drop in hiring extends to campus recruitment, as IT companies have indicated that they won't be visiting campuses during the upcoming quarter.

Infosys, The impact of these trends is particularly pronounced among India's largest IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Wipro , and HCLTech . Collectively, these firms reported a substantial decrease in their headcounts, amounting to 22,000 fewer employees. Both TCS and Infosys have hinted at further reductions in headcount in the next quarter.

Vijay Sivaram, CEO at Quess IT Staffing, highlighted that non-tech hiring continues to show promise, experiencing steady growth. ""IT services hiring is definitely low, and we are continuing to see a lack of new hires as well as replacement hires. But we continue to see some fair amount of neutral behavior or some amount of small growth happening in the Global Capability Centre (GCC) for technology hiring,"" explained Sivaram.

While IT hiring faces challenges, the broader non-IT job market appears to be relatively stable. Sivaram noted that there may be a shift in freshers' salary expectations, as there could be lower demand for IT positions. Fresh graduates might consider positions in startups or other roles related to IT-enabled jobs

Despite these challenges in the IT sector, experts like Sivaram believe that the situation will likely improve in the coming months. ""It is the volume of demand that is coming down, which will push people to move outside of pure software roles, potentially leading to a decrease in their average salaries,"" Sivaram explained.

ICRIER's report advocates an enhancement of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme instalment, which has been operational since December 2018.

Share Market Live NSE

It said that PM-KISAN instalment limit should be hiked to ₹10,000 per family, from the current annual transfer limit of ₹6,000. The basis for this proposed hike takes into account the eroding effect of inflation on the initial ₹6,000, which, by 2023, effectively translates to ₹8,000. Moreover, the report acknowledges the losses incurred by farmers due to restrictive marketing policies, emphasising that an annual sum of ₹10,000 is the bare minimum necessary to support the agricultural community.

Ashok Gulati, professor at ICRIER and an author of the report, emphasised that the majority of beneficiaries under the PM-KISAN scheme are small landholders, owning less than 2 hectares. While talking to CNBC-TV18.com, he said that large farmers with significant surpluses make up only a fraction of the recipients.

""Keeping the policy simple and accessible for all is crucial,"" he told CNBC-TV18.com.

Notably, the PM-KISAN scheme aims to provide income support to land-holding farmer families. The financial burden of this support falls entirely on the government. State governments identify eligible farmer families based on scheme guidelines, and funds are directly transferred to their bank accounts.

In a recent development, the central government reported substantial savings of ₹10,000 crore under the PM-KISAN scheme, attributed to the removal of ineligible beneficiaries after a thorough ""clean up"" of the database, sources earlier informed CNBC-TV18. This revelation raises the possibility of extending the scheme to include landless farmers, such as sharecroppers and tenant farmers, potentially broadening its impact.

While the savings provide room for increasing instalments, it is crucial to note that there has been no official proposal from the government regarding any changes to the scheme. Any such proposal is expected to originate from the agriculture ministry.

Furthermore, the government is anticipated to release the 15th instalment of the PM-KISAN scheme between November and December 2023, although no official announcement has been made. The 14th instalment, disbursed on July 27, 2023, reached approximately 85 million farmer beneficiaries, pushing the total amount transferred under the scheme beyond Rs. 2.59 lakh crore."

92,CNBC,India's direct tax-to-GDP ratio rising on better data from demonetisation and GST,https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/direct-tax-to-gdp-ratio-india-rising-better-data-demonetisation-gst-18126911.htm,"Oct 25, 2023 1:21 PM","The Central government’s tax collections have been steadily growing faster than the nominal GDP for the past two-and-a-half years; and from what one learns from the Finance Ministry mandarins, this trend is a product of years of interfacing multiple data sets starting with demonetisation and continuing through GST. These mandarins say this trend of taxes growing faster than GDP may continue for a few more years.

Share Market Live NSE

First the numbers:

RATE OF GROWTH OF TAXES (%) VS GROWTH IN NOMINAL GDP Nominal GDP Corporate Tax Growth Growth in Income Tax Tax Buoyancy 2021-22 19.5 55.6 43 2.52 2022-23 15.4 16 20 1.1 2023-24(Apr-Aug) 8 15 35.7 -

It’s clear now that, for the third year running, a rise in direct taxes is far higher than the rise in nominal GDP. Within direct taxes, the growth in income tax is showing much higher buoyancy.

So, what’s going right here? Highly-placed finance ministry officials say it’s the combined effect of demonetisation and GST and the intensive efforts of the tax departments to chase suspected evaders.

Post demonetisation, the income tax department made a list of millions of new taxpayers and searched across this data for common addresses, common directors, promoters and other such parameters. In many cases they found 40-50 companies registered from a one-room address in Kolkatta or Jaipur or other cities. They found a bunch of companies connected via common promoters or directors.

After repeated notices to these suspicious entities over the past four years, the department has found that many of these new filers are making higher income declarations, knowing the tax-dogs have caught their scent.

GST was always expected to have a salutary impact on indirect taxes as more companies would prefer to only buy from and sell to companies that are in the tax bracket, so they could take credit for the GST they pay. This expectedly led to more “unregistered” companies or those in the cash economy, registering and paying taxes.

As one of the early proponents of GST, fiscal economist Govinda Rao pointed out, GST will bring higher direct taxes when those who shift from cash to the “formal” or “taxed” system, are forced to declare what would have hitherto been “black” incomes. Many lawyers and doctors also fall in this category. And though the GST will not lead to these professionals declaring all their income, they are still declaring more than they did earlier as tax authorities have more data on them.

The GST data is a treasure trove, a top bureaucrat said, explaining that tax authorities have been fleshing more details of those who paid little or no tax. He did not wish to be named.

Finally, tax exemptions allowed on EPFO and insurance premia have been capped over the last few years. Before the 2021-2022 fiscal year, the interest credited to the EPF account on any amount of contribution was tax-free. A cap of Rs 2.5 lakh was introduced in the 2021-2022 fiscal year. This also led to an increase in tax collections, albeit slightly, said the bureaucrat referred to earlier.

Likewise in this year’s budget, tax for insurance policies issued after April 1, 2023, the tax exemption on maturity benefits will only be applicable if the aggregate premium paid by the individual is less than Rs 5 lakh. Tax exemptions to debt mutual funds have also gone. The benefits of these measures will be seen in the coming years, but again these will be small gains.

However, senior finance ministry officials believe that the benefits from getting habitual evaders into the tax net, thanks to demonetisation and GST, may continue to flow for a bit more.

India’s direct tax to GDP ratio has been slowly crawling up from an average of 5.5% from FY12to FY21, to a high of 5.97% in FY22 and 6.08% in the last fiscal. But this is still lower than the 6.3% of direct tax-to-GDP ratio that the country achieved in 2007-08.

The moral here is, fewer exemptions and better tax administration help garner more taxes, but the best trigger for higher taxes is higher growth. The 2007-2008 financial year witnessed the highest ever tax-to-GDP ratio in India’s history, simply because the year was preceded by three consecutive years of 8% real GDP growth."
93,CNBC,View: The importance of remittances,https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/view-the-importance-of-remittances-18139301.htm,"Oct 25, 2023 1:19 PM","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has, in a September 2023 paper ‘Resilient Remittances ‘authored by Dilip Ratha, the World Bank lead economist, highlighted the critical role that remittances play in developing economies.

Share Market Live NSE

Migrant workers send money back home; this provides vital income to millions of families, and their contribution is often overlooked. As per the paper, 2022 saw global remittances reach a record $647 billion and very significantly three times the official development assistance (ODA) from multilateral agencies.

Remittances, as has been observed, are stable, even when there is a crisis in the source or receiving country. For instance, during COVID-19 in 2020, while global income fell by 3%, remittances fell by just 1.1%.

India is the world’s largest recipient of inward remittances. In 2022, it became the first country to receive more than $100 billion. The World Bank’s latest Migration and Development Brief pegs the figure at $111 billion, growing at a rate of more than 12%.

This has substantially helped boost the foreign exchange reserves, which today stand in the region of $586 billion. The contribution of inward remittances from the large Indian diaspora constitutes, in effect, more than 18% of the country’s foreign exchange reserve. Remittances account for nearly 3% of India’s GDP. They certainly act as a buffer for our external sector, especially when the trade deficit increases which today stands at $19.37 billion.

The USA (and not the UAE, as is popularly believed) is the major source country for India’s remittances. Nearly 23% of the total remittances come from the USA, reflecting the profile of Indians working in the USA, all or most of whom are highly educated, well-placed professionals. This is in sharp contrast to the profile of the Indian community in the Gulf countries: less educated, low-skilled, and informally employed.

Section 3 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) prohibits receiving 'otherwise through an authorised person, any payment by order or on behalf of any resident outside India in any manner' — in other words, all inward remittances must be received only through authorised channels.

How much inward remittances are we losing to informal channels, or more popularly known as hawala? The exact quantum will always be only an informed estimate. The White Paper on Black Money laid before Parliament in 2012, while presenting different facets of black money, made mention of the estimates as per various studies conducted in the past. It suggested that, as per these studies, it could range from 5% to 14.4% to 20.7% of the GDP. This is huge. This covers all aspects of black money, not just money received through hawala channels.

The frequent seizures made by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the customs formations that are indicative of gold smuggling have increased alarmingly. With Diwali around the corner, smuggling is only bound to increase. A collateral impact of gold or any smuggling is that all accounts are settled largely through hawala. What this suggests is that correspondingly and consequently, there is a loss of foreign exchange. According to the details available on the website of the Enforcement Directorate, more than 32,000 investigations have been initiated under FEMA in 2022–23 (till January 23). Newspaper reports highlight raids across the country on Hawala operators and illegal forex dealers. The investigations initiated also mention the 'detection of suspected laundering of undisclosed income running into thousands of crores'.

This raises the larger question: why hawala continues to be a popular mode of sending remittances despite the dramatic growth and easy availability of banking channels? The immediate answer is that illicit channels are easier, faster, more flexible, promise delivery of cash to your residence, and are less expensive. Even though, in most cases, the money being remitted is money earned by migrants from legal sources, illegal means are used to remit the money to their homes. This is unfortunate and reflects poorly on banking channels. Banks must compete not only with each other but with illicit channels that are freely available. They must ensure better service than these informal channels.

An issue often cited is that licit channels have too many regulatory requirements to fulfill, and consequently, even genuine customers shy away from using them. Every remittance transaction is treated with great suspicion. Banks should follow a risk-based approach to allow for less cumbersome legal requirements. The rate of exchange is another factor. Banks undoubtedly have less control over this. However, the fact remains that every migrant keenly watches this and would like to get as good a rate as possible—licitly, failing which—illicitly. The growing reach and popularity of digital wallets via smartphones is one answer. It is possible to access your digital wallet held in India from abroad and transfer money from your account locally; however, if digital wallet facilities are available abroad for you to transfer money from there to India, it will help reduce the menace of hawala.

Migration is only going to increase. The Indian diaspora spread between various categories as per the Ministry of External Affairs, as non-resident Indians, persons of Indian origin and overseas Indians will increase from the 210 countries they are currently residing in. Remittances will also increase. It will be in the government’s interest to make remittances through licit channels more convenient. It will substantially add to our foreign exchange reserves and reduce black money within the country.

Government sources have disclosed that states have been advised to make full use of their unspent funds before requesting additional financial support.

Share Market Live NSE

The primary message from the central government is one of fiscal responsibility. Presently, states are being urged to diligently assess and utilise their idle funds, ensuring that all unspent funds are exhausted before seeking further financial assistance from the central government.

Additionally, the government is working to address its debt levels, aiming to reduce overall expenditure as a long-term goal. This approach aligns with the Finance Minister's statement that fiscal profligacy should be avoided to prevent leaving a burdensome debt for future generations. However, the government's options for achieving this goal are limited, primarily involving adjustments to expenditure at some point.

Thirdly, it is important to acknowledge that the central government may not be able to maintain the high rate of capital expenditure witnessed in the last two years. For instance, the direct central government capital expenditure was around six lakh crore in FY22, but the budget allocates 10 lakh crore for this purpose . The actual figures will depend on the revised estimates (RE).

The central government is now indicating that sustaining such elevated levels of capital expenditure may not be feasible, thereby emphasising the need for private sector participation.

Lastly, regarding the current financial year, the government anticipates staying within the food subsidy budget. There may be some additional allocation for The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA), but this will be done within the established fiscal limits. The central government remains committed to its fiscal deficit target of 5.9% for this financial year."

Share Market Live NSE

CNBC-TV18 had earlier reported that the government is considering a proposal by exporters for a reduction in MEP for basmati rice from $1,200 per tonne.

Sources told CNBC-TV18 that recommendations were made by rice exporters from Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh before inter-ministerial committee. Further, the industry had urged govt to reduce MEP for basmati rice to boost export competitiveness

According to the latest media reports, the government has decided to reduce the MEP for basmati rice shipments to $ 950 per tonne from $ 1,200 per tonne fixed on August 25.

Shares of KRBL and LT Foods are up 1.5% while Chaman Lal Setia is up over 1% on BSE on the BSE. Kohinoor Foods shares surged over 5% and are trading at ₹ 36.

Rice industry stakeholders have been urging the government to lower the MEP for basmati rice to enhance their export competitiveness. They cite recent challenges, where they could not secure orders at global food fairs in Istanbul and Iraq due to the relatively high MEP of $1,200 per quintal.

Consequently, Indian rice exporters lost orders to competitors from Pakistan and Thailand, undermining the nation's position in the international rice market. The proposed reduction in MEP aims to address these concerns and bolster India's standing as a leading exporter of premium basmati rice.

It's expected that this move will not only benefit the rice industry but also ensure that Indian consumers continue to have access to affordable rice options while supporting the country's rice farmers in obtaining competitive prices for their produce

Share Market Live NSE

""One thing that the MPC has been trying to communicate is that all regulators and authorities with price-setting power, such as the CACP, should internalise the 4% inflation target,"" Goyal said in an interaction with Moneycontrol. The Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices, or CACP, is an advisory body that recommends the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for 23 agricultural products.

After food inflation hit a 42-month high of 11.51% in July, the government had restricted the export of a number of food items, including wheat, rice, and onion. While food inflation, along with the headline retail inflation rate, has eased significantly since then.

Goyal said that a move to a more market-determined system will ensure reduced interventions. ""But it takes time to gradually move towards such a system. We have seen some convergence in prices across parts of the country. As India becomes a developed country, it will lose certain safeguards and we will see more convergence between domestic and international prices,"" she said.

According to Goyal, the inflation can return to target earlier than RBI's forecasts given the various factors at play: falling core inflation, recurrent supply shocks, and volatility in the Middle East, among others. ""…you never know what effect this combination can have... So, we will wait and watch the data,"" she said."

Share Market Live NSE

Varma further said India should be willing to accept inflation between 4% and 5% for several quarters as the price of avoiding a growth shock.

""I am a little more optimistic about growth than I was 2-4 months ago. My cautious optimism stems from improved consumer confidence and various indicators that point to the continuation of the growth momentum,"" he told PTI in a telephone interview.

While keeping the global growth projection for FY24 unchanged at 3%, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently revised its growth projection for India upwards by 20 basis points to 6.3% in October.

""However, the outlook remains fragile because demand is now disproportionately dependent on household spending with other components of demand encountering headwinds,"" the eminent economist emphasised.

Explaining further, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member said, the external demand is weak due to the sluggishness in the world economy; the revival in private capital expenditure is still too tentative and muted.

""Fiscal consolidation amounts to a withdrawal of the pandemic era government spending stimulus,"" Varma, currently a professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad noted.

India's GDP growth in 2022-23 was 7.2%, lower than 9.1% in 2021-22.

According to the Reserve Bank of India's projections, India's GDP is likely to grow at 6.5% in the current fiscal year.

Asked when inflation will fall back to the RBI's target of 4%, Varma said August inflation was high, but September inflation is within the band and October inflation is also expected to be low.

Pointing out that India has been experiencing a lot of volatility in commodity and food prices over the last couple of years, he said in this context, a sharp rise or drop in inflation in one or two months does not mean anything.

""I am confident that we will achieve this goal, but I think it will take a few more quarters... We should be willing to accept inflation between 4% and 5% for several quarters as the price of avoiding a growth shock,"" Varma said.

The eminent economist noted that a more rapid pace of reduction could impose an intolerable growth sacrifice.

Annual retail inflation, called CPI or consumer price index, rose 5.02% in September from 6.83% in the previous month on the back of softer vegetable prices.

Recently, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das has said that the fundamental goal of the monetary policy is to align inflation with the 4 per cent target and anchor inflation expectations.

RBI MPC in its last meeting earlier in the month, decided to keep the benchmark lending rate at 6.5%, for the fourth time in a row, in a bid to keep retail inflation under check.

Responding to a question on the implication of high crude oil prices on the government's subsidy figure and inflation, Varma stressed that there is no question that the conflicts in the Middle East pose risks to the world economy.

""What I find reassuring is that oil prices have remained range-bound in the face of these conflicts,"" he said, adding this is in his view suggestive of depressed global demand putting a lid on prices.

Varma, however, warned that of course, a bigger flare-up in the region that takes us back to 1973 would be a very different situation, but as of now there is ground for guarded optimism.

""These conflicts would slow the fall in inflation but would not reverse its decline,"" he opined. The Israeli military has been carrying out retaliatory air strikes on Gaza following the unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 by Hamas."

""We own it and we believe that it is worth much more than it is right now but the growth has to show the way. In the next two years, that will happen,"" he said.

The bank recently announced the appointment of Ashok Vaswani as the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD and CEO) of Kotak Mahindra Bank. Vaswani will succeed Uday Kotak, who resigned after a 21-year tenure at the bank.

Shenoy said Vaswani's appointment has reinstated his confidence in the bank.

In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a net profit of ₹ 3,191 crore, marking an impressive 23.6% increase compared to the previous year. This result closely aligned with the expectations of the CNBC-TV18 poll, which had estimated a net profit of ₹ 3,124.2 crore.

Shenoy is also positive on ICICI Bank as the second quarter growth overall has been fantastic.

ICICI Bank, India's second-largest private sector lender, has received a thumbs up from analysts following a robust second quarter show.

ICICI Bank's Q2FY24 net profit surged to ₹ 10,261 crore, marking a substantial year-on-year growth of 35.8%. This exceeded the expectations of analysts, who had anticipated a net profit of ₹ 9,513.3 crore, according to a CNBC-TV18 poll. In the previous quarter, Q2FY23, ICICI Bank reported a net profit of ₹ 7,557.8 crore.

Diwan keeps both ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank at the top of his investment priorities, with a keen eye on HDFC Bank as an interesting opportunity in the near future.

Shenoy is also bullish on Jio Financial Services from the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) space, noting his ownership of Jio Financial shares and long-term expectations for growth. ""I don’t expect any surprises in the shorter term. So it is a small part of our portfolio, next two years, you should wait for them to grow,"" Diwan explained, suggesting that the future holds potential for the company.

Contributing 13% to global GDP, the industry has remained resilient amid multiple challenges. The emergence of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D Printing, and Robotics, offer the potential to help the industry address its challenges more effectively and capitalise on emerging opportunities.

Share Market Live NSE

The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years, with an estimated CAGR of 11% from $8.2 trillion to $17 trillion by 2029, experts say. This growth is driven by certain factors such as government initiatives, lower interest rates in a few developed economies, demand for renewable energy, public private partnerships, new age technology and higher disposable income.

This year's edition of World of Concrete India brought together over 10,000 industry experts and more than 200 exhibitors from around the world. The three-day event featured a comprehensive showcase of the latest products, technologies, and innovations in the concrete sector, with a focus on sustainability. The expo also featured over 70 speakers delivering insightful sessions on a wide range of topics, including sustainable concrete construction practices, digital and automation technologies in construction, and Net-Zero concrete.

Some of the key companies that participated at the event include Ambuja Cement, Reliance Industries, Asian Paints, Godrej Constructions, Sika India, Penetron, QGreen, MconRasayan, Amchem Products, Shree Premix Industries and many more.

Speaking at the launch of the White Paper on the construction industry, Pradeep Mukherji, Managing Partner, Tauran Advisors said, “In the rapidly evolving landscape of the construction industry, the adoption of digital technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and Robotics & Automation, is heralding a new era of transformation. AI is poised to play a pivotal role in reshaping the sector by addressing a range of challenges and delivering significant advantages. This paper delves into the critical role of AI within the construction industry, emphasizing its relevance and outlining the advantages it brings across construction processes. The paper also explores AI trends, opportunities, and areas where AI can provide a new dimension to the industry.”

To meet industry needs, AI has the potential to accelerate growth and add value at all project stages, from design and financing to construction, operations, and business model changes. AI is estimated to boost industry productivity by increasing it from 1% to 1.5% annually.

Sharing his insights, Gaurav Karnik, Real Estate National Leader, and Tax Partnership at EY India, highlighted ""India's position as the fifth-largest global economy, poised to reach $26 trillion by 2047 with a per capita income of $15,000. The construction sector, contributing 9% to GDP and employing almost 50 million, is instrumental in India's remarkable growth. Government support for capital projects has fuelled this growth over the last five years. Key initiatives include smart cities, data centres, and reducing logistics costs to 8% of GDP by 2030. Challenges like low productivity and safety persist, but digital innovations like modular manufacturing and drones offer solutions. The concrete industry can surmount these challenges and achieve its ambitious growth goals by leveraging platforms such as the World of Concrete India Expo. This event showcases state-of-the-art concepts and technology within the concrete sector.""

With rapid urbanisation and investments, the Indian construction industry is expected to be among the third largest construction markets in the world by 2025. At present, only 20% of the infrastructure that will be needed by 2050 exists. This presents a significant opportunity for the construction industry to play a leading role in filling this gap in the coming decades.

Emphasising on the significance of the event, Yogesh Mudras, Managing Director, Informa Markets said “World of Concrete India 2023, a prominent event in the construction industry, takes centre stage amidst significant developments in India's construction sector. The sector employs an estimated 71 million workers as of 2023 and aims to reach 100 million by 2030 to support the national economic growth. Government initiatives like Housing for All and Smart City Projects are propelling urban infrastructure and construction development. The surge in demand for residential housing, driven by increased urbanization and rising household incomes, further underscores the industry's potential.”

Emphasising on digital transformation and infrastructural development, Sanjay Bhatia, IAS, Upa Lokayukta, Maharashtra said, ""India's commitment to massive infrastructure development is evident with plans for 600 new modern railway stations and the construction of 100 new airports, reflecting a profound dedication to modernization and nationwide transformation. Trust in public-private partnerships and decision-making is paramount, ensuring the smooth execution of projects and fostering a win-win environment for all stakeholders. World of Concrete India, has played a crucial role in bringing together industry leaders and fostering collaboration, making these ambitious endeavours even more successful.""

Stressing on sustainability and lowering the carbon footprint, Mr V Ramgude, Chief Engineer, PWD, Government of Maharashtra said, ""With the construction industry's rapid expansion, life cycle cost considerations and sustainability have become paramount. Material selection must prioritise sustainability, functionality, and durability, and meeting Indian standards. Construction depletes vital resources like metals and sand, so we're exploring geosynthetics and ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete to reduce our carbon impact. Our goal is to build architectural wonders, but the shortage of skilled engineers and labour poses safety risks.""

Underscoring the significance of the US-India commercial connection, Mr John McCadams Commercial Officer, US Consulate Mumbai said, ""The US-India commercial relationship is critically important to both of our economies and to the future of global trade. The World of Concrete India event is an excellent illustration of how the United States and India are working together to expand infrastructure globally while also creating jobs in both nations. With 3.3% of GDP allocated to infrastructure in India's budget for 2023–2024, there are many prospects for creative solutions. The U.S. Mission in India is dedicated to encouraging sustainable and economical practices and supporting this progress.""

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the industry and revolutionize various processes in the construction project lifecycle. AI facets such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Robotic Process Automation offer diverse capabilities for the industry to harness."
101,CNBC,China’s solar exports rise but PV Modules trade sharply falls with India: Report,https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/chinas-solar-exports-rise-but-pv-modules-trade-sharply-falls-with-india-report-18119161.htm,"Oct 21, 2023 2:20 PM","It's been a difficult year for China in terms of trade. According to the recent data released by the country’s customs authority, exports and imports for China have seen a sharp fall consistently.

However, it's not just semiconductor devices and computers which have seen a drop in exports from China to countries like US over the past few months. Interestingly, exports of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules to India from China have seen a decline of over 70% on yearly basis, as per UK-based energy think tank Ember’s report.

Rising trade barriers

Unlike the Europe where solar PV module imports from China have significantly increased for the first half of 2023, Sam Hawkins, Data Lead at Ember attributes the fall in PV module exports to India due to the introduction of stringent tariff policies.

Additionally, the Union Government had also introduced measures like the Production-Linked Incentive Scheme and mandated approvals for solar manufacturers in India in a bid to boost domestic manufacturing.

“Basic customs duty of 25% on solar cells and 40% on solar modules, which is applicable on importing modules from China, is making the move an unviable option compared to the domestic players,” said Jyoti Gulia, Founder, JMK Research & Analytics.

Similarly, the norms on the Approved List of Module Manufacturers (ALMM) are currently put on hold, however, once in effect, it can further vitiate imports of solar PV modules from China.

“From April 2024, only ALMM-listed modules have to be there across projects installed in India. So, again that time from China, it makes no sense (to import) because none of the Chinese players are part of that list as of now,” added Gulia.

China’s dominance in solar manufacturing

Elements like solar cells, which include unassembled components needed for making solar panels, form 10% of China’s solar exports in value. Despite a decreasing trade of solar PV modules from China, Ember’s report points out that India is the second largest importer of solar cells from China after Turkey.

“India is increasing its base on the module side. But to build those modules, they still have to get cells from China,” Gulia said.

Ember’s data further indicates that a major chunk of the world’s solar export demand is fulfilled by China. For the first half of 2023, China’s solar exports increased by 34% with 114 GW shipped globally in comparison to 85 GW for the same period last year.

Additionally, Europe which is increasingly transitioning away from fossil fuels for power generation, stood out to be the biggest importer of solar PV modules from China.

”China has a massive head start when it comes to manufacturing solar panels. Traditionally, China's exports have been around the apparel, and furniture industries but now, it's around solar, electric vehicle batteries etc. As a matter of state policy, there is this big push to kind of support manufacturing capabilities,” Gulia said.

Highlighting India’s heavy reliance on China in making solar panels, Gulia added, “We still have to import polysilicon wafers to support the current manufacturing. There is no other way. I think 97% of the polysilicon base is still in China, anyone who sets up facilities be it the US or Europe has to be dependent on China. So we still have to wait and watch and see how alternate strategies will play out.”

Diversifying solar supply chains

China’s share in solar module production has come to 70% for 2021-22, as per a report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

Today, it is widely accepted that China has a strong foothold in solar manufacturing but countries like the US are aiming to provide impetus to domestic players.

The US Inflation Reduction Act, 2022 is the latest effort in not only lowering emissions but also incentivising solar panel manufacturing via tax credits.

Similarly, according to IEEFA’s data, India’s solar exports are seeing a surge in demand with growth of 5x for FY2023 against FY2022. India’s solar industry players also anticipate a greater impetus to domestic manufacturing and categorise it as a need.

“Covid-19 has been a reality check for all of us and has exposed our dependency or rather vulnerability on our solar supply chain. It is time for us to become more self-reliant and bet on our domestic capabilities, not just for us, but also for the greater good of energy transition and ensuring we are more inclined towards our own energy security,” said Subrahmanyam Pulipaka, CEO, National Solar Energy Federation Of India.

While India’s solar exports are dominated by countries like the US, China’s solar supply chain has maintained its share of exports to Europe and is increasing trade to Africa with each year. Supply chain shocks from China remain concerning, and issues relating to skilled workforce are still unresolved.

“There is a lack of skilled manpower, a lot of manufacturers have to still rely on other technicians or experienced professionals from China only to set up their module lines or cell lines,” said Gulia.

Similarly, the production apparatus is another area of concern for India’s solar manufacturing ambitions. “We have huge plans for increasing our manufacturing capacity, but the technology and demand for equipment are an integral part of the requirements for us to scale up our manufacturing. We need emphasis and focus on that,” added Pulipaka."

In recent developments, sources suggest that internal discussions are ongoing between the governments of India and the UK to find common ground on these thorny matters. Several prominent business houses and trade chambers have also been consulted to offer their insights.

As of now, there is no official confirmation from either the Indian government or the UK regarding when or if a formal agreement will be reached. The UK Department for Trade, in a statement to CNBC-TV18, emphasized their commitment to an ambitious trade deal but stressed that any agreement must be fair, balanced, and in the best interest of the British economy.

Notably, the UK government has refrained from making comments on live negotiations or speculating about potential visits by high-ranking officials. It's worth mentioning that no official announcement has been made regarding a visit by the UK Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, at this point.

The trade office overseeing the negotiations has indicated that the talks have entered their most complex phase, addressing aspects related to goods, services, and investments. Historically, the most challenging aspects of trade negotiations tend to surface towards the conclusion of talks, and these discussions are proving no different.

While both sides express a desire to expedite the process, uncertainty surrounds the timeline for concluding the India-UK FTA. The negotiations are poised at a critical juncture, with experts and stakeholders closely monitoring the developments, hoping for a resolution in the near future. However, the lack of clarity regarding the timeline leaves many questions unanswered, and the prospect of a formal announcement hangs in the balance.

In the coming weeks, the international business community and stakeholders from both nations will continue to watch closely, eager for any signs of progress in these crucial trade negotiations.

103,CNBC,US and UK say 'concerned' by departure of Canadian diplomats from India,https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/india-canada-united-states-united-kingdom-urges-dont-insist-on-diplomatic-reduction-18118621.htm,"Oct 21, 2023 11:00 AM","The United States and Britain on Friday urged India not to insist Canada reduce its diplomatic presence in India and expressed concern after Ottawa pulled out 41 diplomats amid a dispute over the murder of a Sikh separatist. Canada has alleged Indian involvement in the June murder in a Vancouver suburb of Canadian citizen and Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar, whom India called a ""terrorist."" India denies the allegation.

""We are concerned by the departure of Canadian diplomats from India, in response to the Indian government's demand of Canada to significantly reduce its diplomatic presence in India,"" US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

We have urged the Indian government not to insist upon a reduction in Canada’s diplomatic presence and to cooperate in the ongoing Canadian investigation. https://t.co/TZ84j5ox0M — Matthew Miller (@StateDeptSpox) October 20, 2023

Washington has said it took Canada's allegations seriously and, along with London, urged India to cooperate with Canada in the murder probe even as Western powers have been reluctant to openly condemn India.

Analysts say the US and the UK do not want to damage ties with India, which they view as a counterbalance to their main Asian rival China. But Friday's statements from the US State Department and Britain's Foreign Office have been the most direct criticism by Washington and London of India thus far in this case.

""We do not agree with the decisions taken by the Indian government that have resulted in a number of Canadian diplomats departing India,"" a spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office said.

Canada withdrew 41 diplomats from India after New Delhi last month asked Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic presence following Canada's allegations over Nijjar's killing. Canada on Friday said it was temporarily suspending in-person operations at consulates in several Indian cities and warned of visa processing delays.

""Resolving differences requires diplomats on the ground. We have urged the Indian government not to insist upon a reduction in Canada’s diplomatic presence and to cooperate in the ongoing Canadian investigation,"" the US State Department said, adding that it expects ""India to uphold its obligations under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.""

Britain's Foreign Office also cited the Vienna Convention. It said ""the unilateral removal of the privileges and immunities that provide for the safety and security of diplomats is not consistent with the principles or the effective functioning of the Vienna Convention."""
104,CNBC,India's GDP growth projected at 6.5% in FY 2023-24 despite global headwinds: RBI governor ,https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/indias-gdp-growth-projected-at-65-oc-in-fy-2023-24-despite-global-headwinds-rbi-governor-18117471.htm,"Oct 20, 2023 11:55 PM","Share Market Live NSE

on Friday, October 20, said that global economic activity is facing deceleration due to stringent financial conditions, however, in contrast, the domestic economic situation in India presents a more optimistic picture, and is projected to grow at a rate of 6.5% for the fiscal year 2023-24. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das

The RBI on Friday released the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting held on October 6. In his statement at the meeting, Das noted that major economies continue to grapple with elevated inflation levels, potentially leading to a prolonged period of tight monetary policy in advanced economies. However, he said that the resilience displayed by the global economy has exceeded prior expectations.

""Headline inflation is moderating, but it remains above target levels in major economies. Monetary policy settings could remain tighter for longer in major advanced economies. Growth remains uneven in many of these countries,"" he said.

Against the backdrop of this challenging global environment, Das said, ""domestic economic activity in India has exhibited resilience, with growth projected at 6.5 percent during 2023-24. India is poised to become the new growth engine of the world backed by its strong domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers.""

He further said that the balance sheets of banks and corporates are strong and healthy. Various sectors, including construction, travel, transportation, and financial services, continue to perform strongly, and the upcoming festival season is expected to further boost consumer spending. Moreover, private sector investment is on the rise, thanks to easing input cost pressures, and consumer outlook surveys have taken on a more optimistic tone.

""Both ma nufacturing and services PMI readings indicate a healthy expansion in these sectors. The external sector has remained eminently manageable, despite global headwinds,"" the Governor added.

In terms of inflation, India experienced heightened pressures during July and August 2023, primarily due to a spike in vegetable prices. This situation underscored the vulnerability of headline inflation to recurring food price shocks, often driven by adverse weather events. ""Adverse weather events – unseasonal rains, skewed monsoon rainfall and unprecedented heat waves – have been major sources of food inflation pressures in recent years,"" Das said.

However, he added that with corrections in vegetable prices and other measures, inflation is expected to fall below the upper tolerance level of 6%.

""The spike in vegetable prices has likely corrected substantially in September and inflation is expected to fall significantly below the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent. The moderation in inflation in September would also be aided by the sharp reduction in household LPG prices in end-August. The projections suggest that throughout much of Q3:2023-24, food inflation pressures may not see a sustained easing, but ample buffer stocks of food grains, softening edible oil prices, and government’s proactive supply side interventions are expected to keep check on unusual price spikes of key food items,"" he said.

Nevertheless, uncertainties persist, particularly in the inflation outlook, influenced by factors like adverse weather events, global food and energy prices, and financial market volatility. The RBI's monetary policy aims to ensure the smooth progress of the ongoing disinflation process.

The RBI anticipates that liquidity in the banking system will remain adequate to meet the economy's productive requirements. Despite uncertainties, ""the Reserve Bank has maintained a flexible and adaptive approach to liquidity management. It will remain nimble footed and ensure that liquidity is actively managed by undertaking whatever operations are necessary from time to time, including open market operation sales (OMO-sales),"" Das said."
105,CNBC,RBI MPC member Jayanth Varma says reduction in repo rate will only occur when inflation subsides to 4% target,https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/inflation-repo-rate-reserve-bank-of-india-mpc-minutes-18116461.htm,"Oct 20, 2023 10:21 PM","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has published the minutes of its monetary policy meeting held on October 6. A prevailing concern among RBI members is the potential impact of recurrent food and fuel price shocks on inflation expectations. As a result, they emphasise that monetary policy should prioritise the ongoing disinflation process until the 4% inflation target is achieved.

Share Market Live NSE

Jayanth R Varma, an External Member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), in an interview to CNBC-TV18 stated that a reduction in the repo rate will only occur when inflation subsides. He stressed that a few quarters of inflation below 6% would not suffice as a reason for a rate cut. Varma reiterated that the RBI's inflation target is set at 4%, not below 6%.

""Our inflation target is 4% and not below 6%. We have to keep real interest rates high enough to drive inflation down to 4%. The repo rate will come down if inflation comes down. For couple of quarters where inflation is below 6% is not a reason for a cut,"" Varma said.

During the October 6th monetary policy meeting, the RBI decided not to increase its lending rate (repo rate), aligning with the consensus expectations of market analysts and economists. The repo rate remains unchanged at 6.5%, consistent with the August policy announcement.

Another external MPC member, Shashanka Bhide, concurred with Varma's perspective, highlighting the need for sustained decrease in inflation rate for any interest rate cut, given the potential impact of a weak monsoon on agricultural and food prices.

""We have had shocks coming externally and also the weather related supply disruptions over the past few months, but concern is also that it should not get generalised into the prices. The shocks that we saw in July and August seem to be transitory but there is this potential for continued effect of weak monsoon this year on agricultural prices, food prices and so on. So it is important that we see the inflation rates going down in a sustained manner for interest rates to be cut,"" Bhide said.

India experienced ""below-average"" cumulative rainfall during the four-month monsoon season from June to September, with a recorded measurement of 820 mm, deviating from the long-period average (LPA) of 868.6 mm. This deviation was attributed to strengthening El Niño conditions. In the four years leading up to 2023, India had witnessed ""normal"" and ""above-normal"" rainfall during the monsoon season.

Contrarily, MPC external member Ashima Goyal argued that India historically did not witness generalised inflation despite multiple supply-side shocks. Therefore, she sees no reason to believe that external shocks will lead to generalised inflation in the future.

""In the past India has seen multiple supply shocks but inflation has not generalised in Indian conditions because we have softness of demand, we don't have a tight labour market, we don't have excessive fiscal spending. So far we have seen that core inflation has not generalised due to the recurrent supply side shocks. So why should we think that it will generalise in future? I think inflation targeting is working, expectations are getting anchored. I think in India we are getting used to 4% inflation now,"" Goyal said.

Even though some of the country's top information technology (IT) companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, and Wipro, have reported good deal pipelines, the overall atmosphere suggests that the deals are relatively lower in value. This, he argued, will affect consumption behaviour in the near future.

He pointed out that the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector has already indicated lower volume growth, reflecting a lack of balanced growth expectations post- COVID-19

Sakshi Gupta, Deputy Vice President and Senior Economist at HDFC Bank, agrees with Pan on a 6.4% growth rate for the next year.

She noted that the formal sector employment data reveals a mixed hiring landscape. While urban unemployment rates are increasing, there has been a slight moderation in the unemployment rate in rural areas.

Gupta prefers to retain a 6.3% target for the year. She anticipates tighter financial conditions in the future, indicating that the latter part of the year may see a decrease in economic growth compared to the first half.

Share Market Live NSE

The conclave, organised by the Institute of Economic Growth (IEG), is taking place in Mumbai from October 20-22 and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das will also be speaking there.

Here are some key takeaways from Sitharaman's speech:

# Effectiveness of multilateral institutions

FM Sitharaman expressed concerns about the inadequacy of major multilateral institutions, including the United Nations, the World Health Organization , the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the UNSC.

""Interventions by these organisations, other than multilateral development banks, are currently less effective than ideal, especially since they were first instituted. This decline in effectiveness is reshaping strategic blocks across the world, impacting supply chains, and has far-reaching consequences,"" she said while adding the world has not yet recovered from COVID.

# Climate change and clean energy transition

India doesn't have answers yet on the transition energy, she said, adding that the path from fossil to renewable is complicated. ""Till today no one is able to tell us which is that one energy which can be used for transition. Low-income, developing countries cannot afford big money for energy transition,"" she said.

The government is constrained by limited financial resources, she said, and natural gas is no longer considered a viable solution for the energy transition. This underscores the need for innovative and cost-effective solutions

# Food security template

India is working on establishing a template to maintain food security, she said. ""There should be a regional balance for basic staples for sufficiency and security,"" she said.

This effort goes beyond India's borders, as the Finance Minister highlighted the importance of regional balance for basic staples to ensure food sufficiency and security, particularly in the context of global uncertainties.

# Regulation of crypto

Cryptocurrency is not something where any one country can succeed, the finance minister noted in her remarks. She added that the matter was taken up with the recently concluded G20 group for consensus on whether crypto should be regulated and if so, how. The G20 is now coming out with a template for the crypto world, she added.

# Debt reduction and fiscal responsibility

The FM said the Indian government is actively working on reducing debt levels, taking inspiration from how other economies manage their debts.

""The government is conscious of the debt burden. Our efforts are very well streamlined and I am sure we will be able to bring it down. Need to be sure that the money spent is well used. Bang for the buck is well in our minds,"" she said.

# Global terrorism as a primary business risk

Sitharaman also touched upon the pressing concern of global terrorism, acknowledging that it has become a ""permanent uncertainty"" with a high-cost risk associated with it. This serves as a primary risk for businesses worldwide and economic policies alone are insufficient to address it. Companies need to factor in the impact of terrorism on their operations and strategies, she said.

Winding up her remarks, Sitharaman pointed out that the government is conscious of macroeconomic stability and fiscal management in its decision-making. This comes at a time when India is gearing up for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and the Budget announcement in February."

He was addressing the Kautilya Economic Conclave 2023 on Friday, October 20.

""I think interest rates will remain high. How long they will remain high only the evolving world situation can tell,"" he said.

He mentioned that though macro stress tests reveal India's scheduled commercial banks will be able to comply with regulatory cap levels even under serious scenarios, there is a need to stay vigilant as ""it’s during good times that vulnerabilities may creep in"".

Das highlighted insights into the challenges and intricacies of managing the country's monetary policy and ensuring financial stability.

Maintaining a Pause on Policy Rates

The RBI governor said the RBI has paused policy rates in 2023 so far. He pointed out that the 200 basis point hikes implemented in recent times are still working their way through the system.

Global Economic Headwinds

Governor Das acknowledged the global headwinds, including a slowdown in global growth and stubborn inflation. Despite these challenges, he noted that the Indian economy has exhibited remarkable resilience.

Inflation Dynamics and Food Prices

Highlighting the RBI's vigilance on inflation dynamics, the RBI governor expressed concerns regarding the uncertainties surrounding food inflation. He highlighted the need for caution in this regard. ""We remain extra vigilant on inflation dynamics; outlook on food inflation is beset with uncertainties,"" he said.

Global Economic Challenges

Governor Das outlined a ""triad of challenges"" facing the global economy, including slowing growth, risks to financial stability, and a slower pace of inflation easing. These challenges have made the task of central banks even more complex.

Challenges in Monetary Policy

Monetary policy, according to Das, has always been a challenging task. He stressed that there can be no room for complacency at any point in time. The central bank faces a delicate balance between promoting growth and maintaining financial stability, with the potential for conflicts between these objectives.

Financial Markets Sensitivity

He also noted that financial markets have become highly sensitive to even the ""slightest piece of information"". The reaction of financial markets to policy changes and economic data has become a crucial aspect of policy-making.

Maintaining Financial Stability

In light of these challenges, Das emphasised that central banks, including the RBI, have a larger responsibility to maintain financial stability. However, he admitted that quantifying financial stability remains an intricate task.

Resilience of Banking Sector

He mentioned that macro stress tests indicate that Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) are expected to comply with regulatory capital levels even under severe economic scenarios.

He emphasised the importance of identifying vulnerabilities during good times to prevent future crises. ""NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) must remain vigilant... roofs need to be built, walls need to be fixed,"" he warned."
112,CNBC,IMF says India in a sweet spot but cautions against a rise in corporate stress from 'higher for longer' rates,https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/imf-krishna-srinivasan-oil-prices-interest-rates-laptop-imports-india-pli-china-growth-18099111.htm,"Oct 19, 2023 10:15 PM","The International Monetary Fund believes the Asia & Pacific region is at the risk of facing higher inflation and lower growth on the back of the ongoing war between Israel and the Hamas.

Share Market Live NSE

In an exclusive chat with CNBC-TV18, IMF Director for Asia and the Pacific region, Krishna Srinivasan, said that while the IMF was still evaluating the impact of the recent Israel-Hamas conflict , one potential channel through which the Asia and Pacific region might be affected was an increase in oil prices.

""A 10% increase in oil prices could lead to a 0.15% reduction in global GDP the following year and a 0.4 percentage point increase in inflation… the impact of rising inflation is expected to be higher in Asia, given its status as an oil-importing region,"" Srinivasan said.

The sharper the rise in oil prices, the more severe the impact could be, he added.

In its latest release on the regional economic outlook for Asia and the Pacific, the IMF says that economic activity in the region remains on track to contribute around two-thirds of global growth in 2023, despite a challenging global environment.

Growth for the region is projected at 4.6% in 2023 and thereafter, moderate to 4.2% in 2024, with risks tilted to the downside. China and India are projected to contribute jointly to about half of world growth in both 2023 and 2024.

The fund had forecast a GDP growth rate of 6.3% for both FY24 and FY25. In its last World Economic Outlook update, IMF had revised India’s FY24 GDP growth estimates up by 20 basis points, due to “resilient domestic demand and strong investment inflows.”

When asked when India would outpace China and become the largest contributor to global growth at the current rates, Srinivasan said India's contribution to global growth is expected to increase to 18% from 16% over the next five years. He expects China to maintain a growth rate higher than the global average for the next five years as well.

Higher-for-longer rates

Srinivasan said the Asia-Pacific's share of global debt had increased to 40% currently from 25% pre-global financial crisis.

“A prolonged period of higher interest rates implies that borrowing costs will rise, putting pressure on debt servicing. The impact will vary depending on the size of each country's balance sheet,” he said.

He believes India, with its reduced non-performing assets (NPAs) and strong financial buffers, is currently in a favourable position. However, he cautioned that as interest rates continue to rise, there could be stress due to the inability of corporates to repay their debt, potentially impacting the financial sector. India should carefully monitor these developments, he warned.

Impact of rising protectionism and the ""China+1"" strategy

Srinivasan also highlighted the growing risks of fragmentation, friend-shoring, and re-shoring in the global economy. Friend-shoring refers to countries increasing trade with alliance partners while re-shoring entails a more inward-looking approach.

“Both scenarios have the potential to reduce global GDP, with a 1.5% reduction in the case of friend-shoring and a 4.5% reduction in the case of re-shoring. While some countries might benefit from trade diversion in the short term, the long-term effects could lead to reduced global demand,” Srinivasan said, highlighting the importance of mitigating these risks.

Asked if India would necessarily benefit from the China+1 strategy , Srinivasan said that any fundamental shift in global supply chains will take time, but there are some signs of trade and investment diversifying into other countries. This shift, however, is expected to be gradual. To benefit from the ""China+1"" strategy, countries would need to undertake deep structural reforms that make them more attractive for both investment and trade.

India’s PLI and import ban strategy

While it was too early to make an assessment of how impactful India’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme is in terms of getting investments and generating jobs, Srinivasan said that one area where India has shone really brightly is the whole issue of digitalisation, and creating digital public infrastructure.

“Given the impressive strides India has made in that context (digital public infrastructure), limiting imports of laptops and IT equipment is not the right way to go,” cautioned Srinivasan. “If India wants to reach its potential, it has to do much more to eliminate these restrictions,” he said.

Terming the government's trade policy in the past few months along with OMSS, stock limits and duties, responsible for stable food retail prices, the Secretary told CNBC-TV18 that the Customs Department has been advised to ensure stricter checks at ports to ensure no export of non-parboiled rice.

Share Market Live NSE

Export of wheat and rice continues to remain banned, with a few exceptions allowing government-to-government export, even as sections of exporters have urged a review of the decision.

Responding to the demand for relaxation in export conditions and several other issues, some sections of traders and exporters approached the government for relaxation on several counts. He said that government policy should be measured against the touchstone of fulfilling the needs of the entire 140 crore population of India.

With 57 lakh tonnes (LT)) of sugar stocks available as of October 1, sufficient for 2.5 months of domestic consumption, more stocks are expected to start arriving from November as the sugarcane harvest and crushing has begun. Stating that exports of sugar will continue to be restricted, the Food Secretary reason that the stress of moisture in the existing sugarcane crop may impact production in the next season, and the government is trying its best to protect consumers from price shocks.

With 3.5% annual inflation observed in wheat, the government said it is prepared to increase the sale under OMSS from the current available stock of 87 LT if the need arises.

While the Food Secretary described wheat prices as ""stable"" in the wholesale and retail market, he pointed out the inflation in rice has been hovering around 11% over the past few months, and the government expects a sharp drop in prices on the back of the 210 LT rice stock available with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the newly harvested Kharif crop for which milling is expected to start soon.

The Union Government is also considering proposals by exporters from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for a reduction in MEP (minimum export price) for basmati rice from the current level of $1,200 per ton.

The industry had urged an interministerial committee to reduce the MEP for basmati rice to boost export competitiveness, with exporters claiming that they couldn't win orders in global food fairs due to a higher MEP of $1,200 per quintal."

Resilient supply chains have become a vital component in the current geopolitical landscape. ""There is an urgent need to diversify supply chains, and India is a natural partner in this endeavour,"" said Arun Kumar.

Celesta Capital, a prominent investment firm, is keen on bolstering India's manufacturing sector, particularly in the areas of deep and advanced manufacturing. Their recent investments in Agnikul and IdeaForge underscore their commitment to India's growth as a manufacturing hub.

Furthermore, global logistics giant FedEx has taken note of India's emergence as a pivotal player in the new world order. Kami Viswanathan, President - Middle East, Indian Subcontinent and Africa (MEISA) Operations, FedEx, highlighted the rise of e-commerce as a key driver for cross-border trade.

""FedEx is witnessing increasing demand from small- and medium-sized businesses seeking to tap into global markets,"" Vishwanathan remarked. She also stressed the importance of a conducive regulatory environment to facilitate these businesses' expansion into global markets through e-commerce.

Vishwanathan praised India's progressive actions in the form of Gati Shakti and National Logistics Policy (NLP) but called for further acceleration in these initiatives. ""More can be done to expedite Gati Shakti and NLP,"" she urged, emphasising the need for streamlining express exports by removing value restrictions and implementing a single-window clearance system.

Congestion at airports for cargo operations and transhipment regulations also came under scrutiny, as Vishwanathan suggested that these bottlenecks need to be addressed promptly.

“This is the overshooting of the fair value of the 10-year rate,” he said.

Emerging markets are reasonably comfortable due to strong monetary policy, Aziz said, adding, that there is a possibility of the Indian economy slowing down in the second half of the current financial year.

Aziz's comments come in the backdrop of the turmoil in financial markets worldwide following a significant overnight increase in US yields. The 10-year yield reached a 16-year peak, at 4.95%, and nearly the entire yield curve, ranging from one month to 30 years, surpassed the 5% threshold. This surge in yields is primarily a reaction to robust retail sales data.

The escalating yields are exerting downward pressure on financial markets over concerns that a substantial portion of funds will be redirected towards treasuries, attracted by their risk-free returns of over 5%.

He will speak to the Economic Club of New York at noon ET.

With the next US Federal Reserve meeting scheduled from October 31 to November 1, investors and analysts are eagerly awaiting crucial insights into the central bank's stance on monetary policy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent remarks have underscored the need for a persistent restrictive policy, signaling cautious optimism amid signs of easing inflation.

The September jobs report released last week delivered a surprise, revealing the addition of 336,000 jobs, nearly double the anticipated figure. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.8%. This robust performance has prompted traders to adjust their expectations, with increased bets on an interest rate hike by the year's end.

Despite the labour market's 33rd consecutive month of growth and an unemployment rate remaining below 4%, concerns loom about the economy's resilience.

Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, has moderated to approximately 3.7% from last year's 9%, influenced by the Fed's proactive approach with a series of interest rate increases over the past 18 months.

The Fed, tasked with maintaining 2% inflation, faces a delicate balancing act. They must determine the optimal number of rate hikes to curb inflation while deciding how long to uphold firm borrowing costs.

US treasury yields have spiked up close to their 230-year average for the first time since 2007, a Reuters report noted quoting Deutsche Bank data. This highlights the challenge of adjusting to higher rates. Bond yields determine the funding costs of governments. So the longer the yields remain high, the more the interest burden.

“The Fed needs to recognise that the incredible increase in the bond yield is already a form of tightening. The bond markets doing a lot of the work for the Fed from here on; I mean, 10-year bond yield is close to 5% is quite a disaster for commercial real estate . So, we have had this rolling recession that is now rolling through commercial real estate, and I do not think the Fed needs to do anymore,” Ed Yardeni, President of Yardeni Research told CNBC-TV18.

At the last policy in September, the US central bank kept the policy rates steady. As per the Fed’s projections released in September , rates are likely to be hiked to a median of 5.6% by the end of 2023, slightly higher than the current range. The current range between 5.25% and 5.5% is the highest in nearly 22 years.

There are two more policy meetings left in the year. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee expects two rate cuts in 2024, taking the rate to around 5.1%.

“The Fed has to recognise that the economy is still very resilient, they don't want to push this thing too far. I mean, if wage inflation is coming down, and if we get a decent consumer price index (CPI), the expectation is 0.3% - couldn’t be lower if the rent inflation finally comes down. I think inflation is coming down without a recession, if that is the case then I don't think the Fed should not push this thing too far,” Yardeni said.

As the Fed officials gather for the October-November meeting, they confront the challenge of interpreting mixed signals from the job market and the broader economic landscape. The strong jobs data alone might not drive another rate increase this year. The Fed will also watch other incoming data including an inflation report to be released on October 12.

“The message from the Fed, when they last spoke, was it's going to be data dependent. Data has not worsened, but it's not improved in terms of a significant slowdown in the economy, which would be considered an improvement that the economic action slowing down. So, the Fed, on the margin, will still be looking at data,” Sandeep Bhatia, Head-Equity and Country Head-India, Macquarie Group told CNBC-TV18 in a recent interview.

“I don't think the Fed increase cycle has completely gone away. Even if it doesn't happen in the upcoming meet, it can happen in the first quarter of next year,” he said.

The upcoming meeting will be a pivotal moment, offering valuable insights into the Fed's strategy for sustaining economic growth and managing inflation pressures."

Stressing on the need to have quick ramp up and ramp down energy sources for grid balancing, the minister described hydroelectric power's role as essential in the path to energy transition as wind energy is intermittent and the sun doesn't shine 24×7. He gave an example of the Bhakra Nangal and Beas dams, which made the green revolution possible in Punjab & Haryana and brought prosperity to these states.

Speaking at the curtain raiser of the sixth Assembly of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), Singh said that the idea to set up a multilateral development bank for solar energy hasn't yet been given up as the alliance wants to de risk investments in solar projects by means of a payment security mechanism apart from insurance.

Singh, who is also serving as the President of the ISA, described the observer status for the body at the United Nations (UN) as a shot in the arm for energy transition while calling for swifter reduction of greenhouse emissions. ISA's Director General, Dr. Ajay Mathur, has described the role of solar energy as ""pivotal"" in achieving the target of tripling of renewable capacity by 2030, as has been emphasised by the COP 28 Presidency.

Leaders from 116 countries are expected to attend ISA's 6th Assembly in New Delhi from 30th October to 1st November 2023. The Assembly is the apex decision-making body of ISA, in which each member country is represented.

The Assembly meets annually at the ministerial level at the ISA’s seat to assess the aggregate effect of the programmes and other activities in terms of deployment of solar energy, performance, reliability, cost and scale of finance. 109 countries are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement, of which 90 countries have submitted the necessary instruments of ratification to become full members of the ISA. Currently, India holds the office of the President of the ISA Assembly, with France as the co-president.

ISA's 6th assembly is slated to deliberate on initiatives that impact energy access, security, and transitions with a focus on universalisation of energy access through solar mini-grids, mobilising finance for accelerated solar deployment and diversification of supply chains.

The ISA Secretariat has planned a high-level conference on new technologies for clean energy transition in collaboration with India's Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Solar Energy Society (ISES) on November 1, with a focus on issues concerning climate change and solar energy deployment.

Share Market Live NSE

The flat reading reported by the Office for National Statistics was disappointing as most economists had predicted another, albeit modest, fall.

It means that the UK's inflation rate remains more than three times higher than the Bank of England's target rate of 2%. The bank, though, is not expected to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in early November, opting instead to keep its main borrowing rate unchanged at the 15-year high of 5.25%.

Last month, the bank brought an end to nearly two years of interest rate rises as inflation fell from multi-decade highs above 11%.

Most economists expect a sizeable decline in inflation next month.

“Progress on falling inflation has stalled, for one month at least,"" said James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank. “It should fall sharply next month to below 5%, as energy prices fall for most people.”

The Bank of England, like other central banks, has raised interest rates aggressively from near zero as it sought to counter price rises first stoked by supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy costs.

Higher interest rates, which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow and bearing down on spending, have contributed to bringing down inflation worldwide. Though most economies have avoided falling into recession, fears remain that the British economy could start to see output shrinking in coming months, hardly the best backdrop for the governing Conservative Party ahead of a general election.

The UK has the highest inflation rate among the Group of Seven leading industrial economies — the US's rate for example is 3.7%.

Some economists attribute that to Britain's departure from the European Union, which has created worker shortages in some sectors and frictions in trade, raising costs for businesses.

The flat reading will raise concerns, certainly among homeowners, that rates will stay higher for longer. Because there is a lag between actual rate hikes and mortgage rates, lots of homeowners and renters have yet to see increases in their housing costs.

Unlike in the US, for example, most homeowners in Britain lock in mortgage rates for only a few years, so those whose deals expire soon know that they face much higher borrowing costs in light of the sharp rise in interest rates over the past couple of years.

Though no official statement has been issued yet, there are speculations that the long-awaited announcement might come to light on Wednesday, October 18.

Media reports suggest that the central government is considering a 4% DA hike, potentially increasing the current 42% to 46%. The final decision will, however, be made by the government and subject to cabinet approval.

The increase in dearness allowance is poised to take effect from July 1, 2023, with the DA rate being determined by the All India Consumer Price Index (AICPI) from January to June.

Let's break down the salary calculations based on the minimum and maximum basic salaries:

For those with a minimum basic salary of Rs 18,000, the current DA at 42% provides a monthly increase of Rs 7,560. With the new DA rate at 46%, this monthly increase will reportedly rise to Rs 8,280. Therefore, employees with this basic salary can anticipate an annual salary increase of Rs 8,640.

For individuals with a maximum basic salary of Rs 56,900, the current DA at 42% adds Rs 23,898 to their monthly earnings. Following the DA hike to 46%, this monthly increase will reportedly escalate to Rs 26,174. Consequently, those with this higher basic salary can look forward to a substantial annual salary increase of Rs 27,312.

What are DA and DR?

Why does the government revise DA/DR?

The government routinely revises the DA/DR rate every six months to counteract the diminishing purchasing power of monthly salary and pension wealth caused by inflation.

How is DA calculated?

DA is calculated as a percentage of the basic salary. The formula for central government employees is as follows:

Dearness Allowance percent = ((Average of AICPI (Base Year 2001=100) for the past 12 months - 115.76) / 115.76) * 100"

Experts say the GST notices sent to the online gaming and casino industry have brought back the ghost of the controversial Vodafone retrospective tax case, which had soured both foreign and domestic investor sentiment.

Share Market Live NSE

The recent slew of notices has raised demands for the past five years, from July 2017 to March 2022. Experts say notices coming after five years, actually point fingers back at the government and its administration.

Questions emerging are, “Why was the government sleeping? These companies have been in business for a long time, as per the law of the land. These companies have been filing monthly returns, followed by annual returns, filed after due reconciliation with the financial records. Then there is a process of audit and scrutiny too, which happens every year. Despite all these practices, why have these notices suddenly appeared?""

“There was enough time with the tax administration to assess these returns and if they were of the view that the filings have been made with an 18% rate and the rate applicable should be 28%, then they should have flagged it then?” said a senior tax advisor, who did not wish to be quoted.

Delta Corp on October 14 disclosed that the company has received fresh notices of alleged shortfall in the payment of Goods and Services Tax (GST) to the tune of Rs 6,384 crore. The notice was received by Deltatech Gaming Ltd, a subsidiary of the company, from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence , Kolkata, on October 13.

Prior to this, there were two notices issued – the first pertaining to a tax demand of Rs 6,236.8 crore for the period between January 2018 to November 2022, and another notice of Rs 147.5 crore for the period between July 2017 to October 2022, the company said.

On September 25, Delta Corp received a notice from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) for a tax shortfall of Rs 11,140 crore, whereas, three of its subsidiaries were issued notices for an amount totalling Rs 5,682 crore. The notices pertain to the period between July 2017 and March 2022.

Online gaming companies, Gameskraft, Dream 11 and Games 24X7 have faced GST notices.

In September last year, a similar show cause notice was served to online gaming company Gameskraft for recovery of Rs 21,000 crore GST. The company had approached the Karnataka High Court which had quashed the show cause notice.

Following this, the revenue department in July filed a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court on the Karnataka High Court ruling in the Gameskraft case.

Given this, where are we?

Experts, who are not only questioning the genuineness of the notices but also feel that these demands are excessively arbitrary in nature, believe that the government might not even be able to realise these demands.

A former GST officer who did not wish to be quoted told CNBC-TV18, “The rate and the value to be applied for online gaming and casinos, have got clarity only in July 2023 by introduction of specific amendments to the law. Applying this amended provision for the past 5 year period, especially when the courts have held online gaming as a game of skill and therefore would not fall under actionable claims, these high-pitched demands appear to be arbitrary and brought uncertainty in the new tax regime, which has is touted as a forward-looking tax regime.”

“Even the amendments brought in which prescribe the valuation rules, even they will face legal challenges, with respect to the amount refunded, as this cannot be treated as a transaction value unless it is applied for playing games.”

Not just the tax officers, even legal experts feel the same.

Abhishek A Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers, who argued for the gaming and casino companies, said, “The tax effect for the period prior to October 2023 will have to be decided by the Supreme Court based on technical, judicial, interpretational and constitutional aspects. The moot point to value the entire amount will have to cross the constitutional validity test on several counts including valuation of actionable claim.”

“Even prospective amendments tax the gaming companies in a particular fashion and inconsistently for the prior period will certainly raise concerns, thereby making the valuation as not only manifestly arbitrary but also against the GST framework which taxes consideration received by the service provider as a basic rule,” added Rastogi.

“Legally they (tax authorities) can send notices but arbitrary notices are subject to judicial review and that is the main question,” Rastogi said.

Another tax practitioner, who is working with a leading tax advisory firm, added, “In wake of significant demands being raised on the gaming industry, it may be worthwhile to note that the recent amendments to GST laws empowering taxability of online gaming industry should have a prospective application only. Moreover, it is rather suggestive that GST was applicable on the GGR (ie service fee or commission) prior to the said amendment, akin to any other service sector.”

“The legal framework of classifying such online games and casinos as actionable claims, explicitly, for the purpose of taxability was not in place. At best, the tax formations can argue that GST was payable retrospectively on the amount deposited in wallets/ value of chips or tokens purchased (as the case may be) and not on deal/ bet value. It may be critical for the government to provide a clear line of sight by way of a clarification on the taxability of past transactions which should provide adequate relief to the industry, and unnecessary litigation could be done away with.”

The fear in the industry is such that many of them while talking to CNBC-TV18 requested anonymity.

Another tax expert, with a global MNC firm, shared, “While the Government has been remarking changes made with effect from 1 October as being clarificatory, the said is not completely aligned to the pre-amendment legislative provisions. Pre-amendment, the deemed value of GST being payable on the face value of the bet was on the supply of actionable claims only and clearly, the platforms are not engaged in the supply of actionable claims. They are a mere platform which arranges various online games.”

“The Government always well recognised the distinction between a platform which merely arranges a supply and the supplier themselves and which is why various provisions were explicitly introduced to hold online platforms in certain cases accountable for payment of GST on certain supplies like Uber/ Ola for passenger transport, Zomato / Swiggy for restaurant supplies through their platform, etc. No such provisions were prescribed pre-amendment for making the online platforms accountable for supplies, if any made through their platform.”

He further added “Separately, there was a tacit acceptance already under the pre GST regime where platforms have always been paying on the platform fee earned by them. And even beyond, the deeming fiction of face value of bet was always only applicable to games in the form of chance and now the stand on creating an artificial distinction between online and offline modes of conducting such games with unsettling settled jurisprudence on these being games of skill is irrational and reprehensible. Such large demands with lingering uncertainties have entailed this blooming industry falling prostrate to India’s taxation mandate.”

So was the decision of the GST council to come up with tax clarity for the online gaming and casinos, retrospectively, right or wrong?

This was the next question that CNBC-TV18 asked.

Here’s what experts had to say.

A former taxman, again who did not wish to be quoted, clearly said, “I don’t blame the DGGI - they are merely implementing the decision of the GST council. I think the decision of the Council is wrong. To suggest that the clarification being given in the 51st & 52nd meeting which needed amendments in the law is reiterating what was always the intention of the law is quite astonishing. The DGGI had no choice but to issue the demand on the full value from 2017.”

“In effect, the clarification made the demands retrospective. The Council could have instead said that this would be prospective only. Yes, there would have been challenges since some notices had been issued, there was no uniformity of practice etc. But this is still better than the present situation where there is bound to be long litigation & uncertainty for the trade till the final outcome.”

Expressing similar sentiments, Dinesh Kanabar, founder and CEO of Dhruva Advisors, a tax and regulatory boutique firm, shared, “The notices sent by the authorities to the gaming companies are of an astronomical amount. If these demands are sustained, many of these companies will not be able to survive. While per se that cannot be the reason why these demands should be criticised, the fact is the law was amended to tax gaming companies in a gross amount at stake. Until then, there was a belief, duly supported by judgements that this stand of the authorities was incorrect.”

“No such demands were raised by the authorities until the amendment to the law. The law is clearly not retrospective and to say that even before the amendment the law always so applied is, in effect, making the law applicable retrospective!! The gaming companies have not collected this tax from their clients shows that this was not their interpretation prior to the amendment. The government needs to seriously rethink the issue.”

Pratik Jain, Partner, Price Waterhouse & Co LLP, added, “ Industry was hoping that 28% GST on the gross amount would be imposed going forward and for the past, the Government might accept the earlier practice. However, it appears that there would be a long-drawn litigation for the past which would get settled only at the Supreme Court level. The GST council should perhaps reconsider this issue again as it may be virtually impossible for the authorities to recover huge demands which have been raised.”

So now, what? What will happen to these demands? Will it just increase litigation? What about the industry, how will they function?

Well, a former tax officer said, “Given such slew of notices, the absence of the GST Tribunal, which has to start functioning urgently because all these notices will be going to the Tribunal. And in case the tribunal is not going to be there the high courts will get clogged unless the Supreme Court can give a decision before that.”

Amit Maheshwari, Tax Partner, AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm states, states that “The 28% GST on the entire bet value, compared to just the platform fee, amplifies the tax liability for online gaming platforms. Implementing such a structure, especially with retrospective effects, could financially strain many industry players. It is imperative to maintain tax compliance, but when tax demands overshadow a company's actual revenue, the system appears imbalanced.”

“Drawing from lessons like the Vodafone case, it's evident that clarity, consistency, and fairness in taxation are paramount to fostering trust and promoting business growth in any sector. A balanced approach, which ensures rightful revenue to the government without hampering business prospects, would be more conducive to fostering a thriving online gaming ecosystem in India.”

Furthermore, Anita Rastogi, an Indirect Tax partner at PWC, commented on this issue, saying, ""Amendments in GST law are usually prospective in nature. Online gaming companies are in the process of implementing these going forward. However, GST notices for demands relating to past periods have been issued. The legality of past-period demands will be decided by the court. Having said that, these demands pose a huge practical challenge for the online gaming industry because taxes for past periods cannot be collected from customers now. The fact that these amounts do not represent the revenue earned by such companies, if they are forced to pay it out of their pockets, their survival is at stake as amounts involved are humongous.”

To be seen is which way these notices finally take the industry."

U.S. crude stocks fell by about 4.4 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 13, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. That was much steeper than a 300,000 barrel draw that analysts had forecast.

Tension in the Middle East escalated after about 500 Palestinians were killed in a blast at a Gaza City hospital on Tuesday that Israeli and Palestinian officials blamed on each other.

U.S. President Joe Biden is set to visit Israel on Wednesday to show support for the country in its war with Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group Hamas. The White House said he will make clear he does not want the conflict to expand.

On the demand side, China's economy likely slowed in the third quarter, data is expected to show on Wednesday, weighed by persistently weak demand, although increased stimulus has improved the prospects Beijing might be able to hit its full-year growth target.

Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in September, spurring expectations of another interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve by year-end. Interest rate hikes to curb inflation can slow economic growth and reduce oil demand.

Venezuela's government and its political opposition on Tuesday agreed to electoral guarantees for 2024 presidential elections, paving the way for possible U.S. sanctions relief that could boost oil supplies.

Share Market Live NSE

A decision on the issue will be taken by an interministerial committee, the date of whose meeting is yet to be known. The current MEP stands at $1,200 per tonne, and the proposed cut could bring it down to $850 per tonne, sources privy to the developments told CNBC-TV18.

The Department of Food and Public Distribution has said the review of the FOB (free-on-board) price of the contract for the issue of RCAC (Registration cum Allocation Certificate) by APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) for export of basmati rice is under active consideration.

This decision comes in response to recommendations put forth by rice exporters from key agricultural states, including Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, before an interministerial committee.

Rice industry stakeholders have been urging the government to lower the MEP for basmati rice to enhance their export competitiveness. They cite recent challenges, where they were unable to secure orders at global food fairs in Istanbul and Iraq due to the relatively high MEP of $1,200 per quintal.

Consequently, Indian rice exporters lost orders to competitors from Pakistan and Thailand, undermining the nation's position in the international rice market. The proposed reduction in MEP aims to address these concerns and bolster India's standing as a leading exporter of premium basmati rice.

It's expected that this move will not only benefit the rice industry but also ensure that Indian consumers continue to have access to affordable rice options while supporting the country's rice farmers in obtaining competitive prices for their produce.

Share Market Live NSE

“It's still early days. But on current trends, yes, it is reasonable to expect that we will do better than the projected 10.5%,” said Nageswaran in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

While acknowledging that the world is undergoing swift changes, Nageswaran emphasized that India's economy is on a positive trajectory.

One of the prominent challenges the Indian economy faces is the surge in Brent crude oil prices and the subsequent tightening of financial conditions. These developments have led to concerns, but Nageswaran believes that India can navigate through these challenges effectively.

“The world has been changing quite rapidly and not necessarily in the best of directions. There are uncertainties with respect to what is happening to the crude oil price. A couple of months ago it was $70/bbl and now it is $90/bbl; the Brent crude oil price, which matters to India. The global financial conditions are tightening and the fact that stock markets around the world don't seem to be getting it, is actually a cause for concern,” he said.

Crude prices have jumped close to 6% since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Experts have warned against a significant surge in prices if the currently-local conflict escalates.

Talking about net exports, Nageswaran indicated that this time the net exports might not play a pivotal role in the growth story. Instead, other dynamics are shaping India's economic outlook.

According to him, money on the ground is being put to work, with investments on the upswing. He said, “I am quite confident that private sector capital formation is not a futuristic story, but a current story. It is unfolding as we speak. So, I am confident, therefore, that these domestic drivers would pick up whatever slack that may arise from the external side.”

CRISIL's just-released Infrastructure Yearbook 2023 forecasts a significant surge in India's infrastructure spending over the next seven years.

Following are the key takeaways from the discussion:

The textile sector's anticipated gains:

With the removal of import duties, Indian textiles, known for their quality and competitive pricing, stand to gain a stronger foothold in the UK market. This sector, a significant contributor to India's exports at nearly $5 billion, could witness a notable boost in its trade volume with the UK.

Support from the domestic alcohol industry:

A reduction in duties from the current 150% to 100% over the coming years, possibly even leading to a phased reduction to zero in the long term is widely anticipated. Such reduction could unlock new opportunities for Indian alcohol producers in the UK market.

On August 30th, Hina Nagarajan , the Managing Director of United Spirits, discussed with CNBC-TV18 the possible ramifications of a UK-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on the alcoholic beverages industry.

She said, ""The impact could range from 5% to 15% depending on the maximum retail price (MRP) of the spirits."" If this possible cut in duty is passed on to buyers, it could be good news for the entire industry. This could mean higher sales volumes.

This came after Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) turned net sellers in September and pulled out Rs 14,767 crore.

Share Market Live NSE

Before the outflow, FPIs were incessantly buying Indian equities in the last six months from March to August and brought in Rs 1.74 lakh crore during the period. This inflow was largely due to the reduction in US inflation from 6% in February to 3.2% in July. The temporary pause in the US Federal rate hike from May to August also played a role, Kislay Upadhyay, smallcase manager and Founder of FidelFolio Investments, said.

Going ahead, the trajectory of FPIs' investments in India will be influenced not only by global inflation and interest rate dynamics but also by the developments and intensity of the Israel-Hamas conflict, Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director - Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Adviser India, said. Geopolitical tensions tend to elevate risk, which typically hurts foreign capital inflows into emerging markets like India, he added.

According to the data with the depositories, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares to the tune of Rs 9,784 crore this month (till October 13). The recent flow trend points towards FPIs adopting a cautious stance towards investing in emerging markets like India.

The sustained rise in US bond yields was the principal factor driving the FPI selling, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said. Additionally, the prevailing uncertain environment resulting from the Israel-Hamas conflict, which has generated heightened geopolitical tension in the Middle East region also played a main factor in FPIs selling, Morningstar's Srivastava said.

This development has sparked concerns about potential disruptions in oil-related activities. This could give rise to inflationary shock and FPIs seem to be bracing for it, smallcase's Upadhyay said. As Israel engages and prepares for a possibly long-drawn battle, FPIs perceive this as an apt time to book profits and show risk-off after a few months of exuberance, he added.

In the current scenario, experts believe that there could be an enhanced focus on safe-haven assets such as gold and US dollars. On the other hand, FPIs invested Rs 4,000 crore in the country's debt market during the period under review.

With this, the total investment by FPIs in equity has reached Rs 1.1 lakh crore and over Rs 33,000 crore in the debt market this year so far. In terms of sectors, FPIs continued to sell in financials, power, and IT, however, they continued to buy capital goods and automobiles.

A government order on Saturday said it would maintain the MEP, initially in place until Sunday, until further notice.

Share Market Live NSE

According to sources, “the GST authorities are issuing notices in large numbers to companies so as to ensure that the notices are issued in a time bound manner.”

However, the fear of the industry is that the first adjudicating authority will confirm the demand and hence there will be an additional burden of litigation cost and pre-deposit amount for filing an appeal.

The matter of blocked credit has been a major issue, the apex court has been hearing the industry’s plea on the matter and recently has concluded the hearing on the crucial section 17 of CGST Act.

Supreme Court, yesterday has however, reserved orders with the direction to the petitioners – industry — to file the written submission so that the matter could be comprehensively addressed.

In this matter, the plea was filed by several industry players having commercial complexes, malls, warehouses, factories, pharmaceutical companies and several other diverse sectors, who had raised the matter before several High Courts and then later it was taken up at the Supreme Court with respect to the statutory provision of blocking credits under the GST regime.

The credits are disallowed for works contract services, other services and goods which are used for construction of an immovable property.

“Revenue is of the view that the construction of an immovable property results in an asset which is not subject to GST and hence the credit must be denied. The industry is of the view that the credit cannot be denied , as the ultimate objective is not to create an immovable property but to render taxable services such as leasing services which are taxable, sources in the know of the development on the condition of anonymity added.

Abhishek A Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers, argued for a dozen of tax payers that blocking of credit will defeat the fundamental objectives of GST framework and will lead to tax cascading. Rastogi had argued that “the objective of GST is seamless flow of credits and any blocking will ultimately defeat the basic objective. The procurement of goods and services, even if these are used in construction of a property, are ultimately used for rendering of taxable services/supplies.”

He added that “the non-obstinate clause used for the purpose of blocking the credit cannot go against the statutory framework. Accordingly, the provisions must be read in such a manner so as to block the credits, only for personal use or consumption, and that the credit must not be blocked when these transactions are for B2B cases.”

Abhishek Jain, Indirect Tax Head & Partner, KPMG said, “With normal period of limitation ending on 30th September for adjudication of issues linked to FY 17-18, multiple notices were issued to taxpayers including substantive interpretative ones like taxation of online gaming, taxation of intra company supplies without a consideration, sector specific issues including rate of GST, credit reversals, etc.""

""Similarly, various notices have been issued on routine reconciliation matters like differences in auto populated inward supplies qua credit claimed by businesses, inward supplies which were blocked under Section 17(5) but have not been reported as ineligible credit, etc. Businesses have been reconciling the actual credits claimed qua those disputed by authorities to substantiate their claim or dispose off any genuine dues,” he added."

Sitharaman also explained that the crypto assets reporting framework will be established by 2027. This framework will provide a structured system for tracking and reporting cryptocurrency transactions, enhancing transparency and regulatory oversight.

Sitharaman also expressed concerns about the possible fallout of the fierce Middle East conflict on fuel prices and the uncertainties surrounding peace.

The minister said, ""...the recent crisis in the Middle East and concerns on fuel are worries which do hold and expressed as well. So the concerns and the uncertainties are about the peace, as a positive factor, fuel concerns affecting the food security aspects and therefore inflation to that extent and then the fragmentation of the supply chains.

Initially introduced on August 25 with an expiration date of October 16, this export duty, set at 20% for parboiled rice, was implemented to ensure a sufficient local rice stock and to control domestic prices.

Share Market Live NSE

The finance ministry, through a notification, has extended this duty until March 31, 2024. With these curbs, India has now placed restrictions on all non-basmati rice varieties.

Non-basmati white rice makes up approximately 25% of the country's total rice exports. To boost domestic supply and manage retail prices during the festive season, the government had previously banned the export of non-basmati white rice in July.

In addition to this, exports of broken rice were prohibited in September of the previous year. Notably, in the first quarter of this fiscal year (April-June), India exported about 15.54 lakh tonnes of non-basmati white rice, a significant increase compared to the 11.55 lakh tonnes in the same period of the previous year.

The ban on non-basmati white rice exports was implemented due to escalating foodgrain prices and higher export volumes.

It's important to mention that India's annual retail or consumer price inflation in September reached a three-month low of 5.02%.

Regarding rice exports, India recorded total basmati rice exports valued at USD 4.8 billion in the 2022-23 fiscal year, with a corresponding volume of 45.6 lakh tonnes.

Non-basmati rice exports in the last fiscal year were valued at USD 6.36 billion, with a total volume of 177.9 lakh tonnes.

During his address, Banga acknowledged the challenges faced by the rapidly changing world and called for collaboration between countries.

Expressing his concern over the declining progress in the fight against poverty, the World Bank president also pointed towards the existential climate crisis, food insecurity, and the impact of conflicts worldwide such as the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

One of the key points in Banga's address was the decline in economic growth in the developing world. He pointed out that economic growth has been falling from 6% to 5% over two decades and is on track for just 4% over the next seven years. Banga highlighted the grim consequences of this, with every lost percentage point pushing millions into poverty.

The speech also emphasised the importance of focusing on women and young people, particularly in the workforce. Banga called for gender equality and youth employment, recognising the demographic challenges faced by the Global South.

Banga also unveiled the World Bank's new vision and mission — to create a world free of poverty on a liveable planet. He stressed the urgency of this mission and highlighted the need for innovative approaches to finance a different world where a ""perfect storm"" of climate change, post-pandemic consequences and poverty is brewing.

""We face declining progress in our fight against poverty, an existential climate crisis, food insecurity, fragility, a fledgling pandemic recovery, and are feeling the effects of conflicts beyond the front,"" Banga said. ""A perfect storm of intertwined challenges and geopolitical complexity that taken together exacerbate inequality.""

Further, Banga discussed the importance of collaboration with the private sector to mobilise resources and drive sustainable progress. He outlined the World Bank's initiatives, such as the Private Sector Investment Lab, aimed at increasing private investment in renewable energy and the energy transition in developing countries.

""Though we don’t have all the answers now, and those we are working toward will take time, we do have desire, energy, and focus,"" Banga said.

The speech ended with a call to action, urging governments, shareholders, and philanthropies to step up and support the World Bank's efforts. Banga emphasised the need for a new, streamlined approach that focuses on achieving impact at scale.

The plenary was also attended by Ukraine's Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.

""We are custodians of an institution with a tremendous responsibility at a time of uncertainty and great consequence,"" Banga said, referring to the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank."

Share Market Live NSE

""It would be a very welcoming, positive surprise if the Fed were to come in and say they are going to pause for now. But, looking at the CPI print numbers, we should brace for another rate hike.""

However, recent developments have shown a divergence of opinion within the Federal Reserve. The minutes from the September 11th meeting indicated a consensus among officials that they intend to uphold restrictive policies until they are confident that inflation is making its way toward the coveted 2% target range.

Despite this consensus, there exists a division among policymakers regarding the necessity of additional interest rate hikes to achieve this goal.

This difference in opinion has been evident in recent statements from various Fed representatives. Some have left the door open for further rate increases, while others believe that the current rate adjustments are sufficient.

When analyzing the individual members' expectations through the dot plot, it becomes apparent that approximately two-thirds of the committee has indicated that one more rate hike may be required before the year's end.

Since March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has raised its key interest rate a total of 11 times, reaching the current targeted range of 5.25% to 5.5%, marking the highest level in 22 years.

On October 12, the financial markets experienced an increase in Treasury yields , with the yield on the 10-year Treasury witnessing an 11-basis point uptick to reach 4.707%. This uptick came as investors assessed recent economic data indicating persistent and elevated inflation, sparking speculations about the Federal Reserve's future actions.

Chetan Ahya , Chief Asia Economist at Morgan Stanley, discussed unforeseen challenges faced by bonds and currencies in India and across Asia in an interview with CNBC-TV18 on October 11. The primary concern is the significant increase in US yields, which has surged by approximately 130 basis points since May. While there has been a slight reduction in US yields, recent geopolitical changes in the Middle East have raised fresh concerns about oil prices, impacting Asian bonds.

Upadhyay believes growth for FY24 will be lower than the Reserve Bank of India forecast of 6.5%.

Key takeaways from the discussion:

How inflation could pan out

Abhishek Upadhyay believes inflation is likely to hover around 5% in the second half of FY24. He did not anticipate a significant upside risk in terms of food inflation.

Bhardwaj forecasts inflation for FY24 at 5.2%. She highlighted food prices as a potential area of concern and cautioned about the clear upside risk associated with food inflation.

Performance of some sectors will be robust

Upadhyay noted that certain sectors, such as capital goods, continue to exhibit strong performance sequentially, underlining their resilience in the current economic landscape

Consumer demand is a point of worry

Bhardwaj remained skeptical about the trajectory of consumer demand, emphasising the need for caution when assessing how it will evolve in the coming months.

According to data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on October 12, India's retail inflation, as gauged by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), decreased to a three-month low of 5.02% in September, primarily due to a decrease in food prices. This marks a return to the Reserve Bank of India's desired level of inflation, which is below 6%, following a two-month gap. In July 2023, India's CPI was at 7.44%, and in August 2023, it stood at 6.83%.

In contrast, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) reported a robust growth of 10.3% in August 2023. This is a notable improvement from August 2022 when factory output, as measured by IIP, had contracted by 0.7%.

A CNBC-TV18 Poll of economists had projected CPI at 5.5% and an IIP at 9.5% for August.

However, this decline in the trade deficit was mirrored by a decrease in overall merchandise exports, falling from $35.39 billion in September 2022 to $34.47 billion in September 2023. The Commerce Ministry attributed this export decline to weakened global demand and other contributing factors.

Share Market Live NSE

Citing a decline in unit value realisation from export of petroleum products from $1094.28/ton last year to $727.76/ton this year, the Ministry said that despite a rise noted in the volume of petroleum exports compared to last year, the amount being reflected in trade data was far lesser due to decline in global prices.

The government attributed the decline in exports of gems and jewellery to lower global demand, issues in sourcing of diamonds and a huge duty on gold imports apart from geopolitical factors like the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, and Israel and Palestine.

Excluding gems, jewelry, and petroleum product exports, September 2023 recorded a 1.86% increase in year-on-year exports, the ministry said. Importantly, merchandise imports from April to September 2023 registered a substantial 12.23% decline.

Despite the WTO forecast for global growth falling from 1.7% to 0.8% by October 2023, the government said that green shoots are being noted in India's exports, particularly in the photovoltaic and electronics sector due to improved export competitiveness after the advent of PLI schemes.

The next US Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting is scheduled from October 31 to November 1.

Key takeaways from US CPI Data

US consumer prices in September rose slightly faster than expected due to higher gas prices and rental costs. This has raised the possibility of the Federal Reserve initiating another round of interest rate increases.

CPI for September rose 3.7%, per data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on October 12.

However, core inflation, which excludes the volatile components of energy and food prices, remained stable with a 0.3% month-on-month (MoM) increase, aligning with analysts' forecasts. On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, core inflation saw a slight decline from 4.3% to 4.1%.

The September jobs report released last week delivered a surprise, revealing the addition of 336,000 jobs, nearly double the anticipated figure. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.8%. The robust performance had already prompted traders to adjust their expectations, with increased bets on an interest rate hike by the year's end.

Kim said it would come as a shock if the US Federal Reserve were to unexpectedly declare a halt in their ongoing series of interest rate increases. Such a move has the potential to create a profound ripple effect in the worldwide financial markets, especially considering that numerous individuals were anticipating further rate hikes to address inflation concerns.

US treasury yields also jumped as investors assessed recent economic data indicating persistent and elevated inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bonds saw an uptick of approximately 11 basis points, reaching 4.707%, rebounding from its earlier session lows.

“The US Treasury bond auction that went on this week, the demand was weaker than expected prompting the yields to elevate,” Kim added.

Contributing to the anxiety is the anticipation of the upcoming earnings reports from major financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo.

The US markets slipped on Thursday, following a two-day surge and in response to the latest inflation data.

The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq lost half a percent each. Dow Futures were down marginally at 33,775 early Friday.

Share Market Live NSE

The consumer price index was unchanged last month from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday, weaker than expectations for a slight increase and edging closer to the deflationary level it fell to in July. Core CPI — which strips out volatile food and energy costs — rose 0.8%, same as August. Producer prices fell 2.5%, moderating slightly from the prior month’s decline.

September inflation data came out below consensus, suggesting a long way to go for the PBOC’s fight against deflation,” said Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., referring to the central bank. “The government has announced hundreds of counter-cyclical measures to boost domestic demand. But consumer confidence remains weak.”

China’s economy has shown signs of stabilization in recent weeks, with factory activity picking up and declines in exports easing. But there’s lingering concern over the recovery, which still faces drags from a property crisis and waning sentiment. Chinese consumers traveled and spent less over the recent Golden Week holiday period than the government had hoped, while lukewarm home sales stirred concerns about whether more support will be needed to bolster growth.

Chinese stocks declined in early trading on Friday, with the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index losing as much as 1.9%, poised to end a six-day winning streak. The onshore benchmark CSI 300 Index of stocks also fell nearly 1%.

Golden Week may have accounted for slower growth in food prices, according to Dong Lijuan, chief statistician with the NBS, who in a statement attributed the softer rate to ample food supply prior to the holiday. She also cited a high base of comparison with last year as a reason for the flat CPI.

“CPI inflation at zero indicates the deflationary pressure in China is still a real risk to the economy,” said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. “The recovery of domestic demand is not strong, without a significant boost from fiscal support.”

Earlier this week, Bloomberg News reported that the government is considering raising its budget deficit for the year as part of a plan to spend more on infrastructure — a form of stimulus to help the economy meet an official growth target of about 5%.

Economists also expect policymakers to consider other measures before the end of 2023, including another cut to policy rates. That may not come for another month or two, though: Analysts expect the People’s Bank of China to hold the rate on its one-year medium term lending facility steady on Monday.

Monetary policy room may be constrained depending on future moves by the Federal Reserve. US consumer prices advanced in September at a brisk pace, reinforcing the Fed’s intent to keep interest rates high to bring down inflation.

The IMF recently cut its growth forecast for China for this year to 5% from 5.2%, and for next year to 4.2% from 4.5%. The economy is losing momentum because of declines in real estate investment and housing prices that endanger government revenues from land sales, as well as weak consumer sentiment, according to the Fund.

Additional data next week will also provide more clues on the state of the economy in the third quarter, including gross domestic product figures and indicators on retail sales, industrial output and unemployment."

Puri was speaking at the launch of the 12th City Gas Distribution (CGD) bidding round in New Delhi on Thursday, October 12.

Puri said he is quite happy with the pace of domestic gas production, which is increasing by 18% year-on-year (YoY). The minister said, “At present, an about 23,500-km long gas pipeline network is under operation in the country and around 12,000-km pipeline is approved/under construction. Efforts are underway to complete the vision of One Nation One Gas Grid by 2030.”

The government expects an approximate investment of $67 billion in natural gas infrastructure in next 5-6 years with India’s daily domestic gas sales likely to grow over four times from the current 35 MMSCMD (million metric standard cubic meters per day) to around 150 MMSCMD by 2028, as per the Petroleum Natural Gas Regulatory Board or PNGRB.

Echoing a similar sentiment, Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain said the government’s current priority is expanding the city gas distribution and piped natural gas network but there is also huge unmet demand in thermal power, fertiliser and industries.

“We think that demand for both PNG and LPG will grow — we are adding 75 lakh new Ujjwala connections. There is space for both LPG and PNG customers to grow.”

Oil Minister Puri also said he expects import dependence on gas to come down as India is on track to achieve 'atmanirbharta' (self-reliance) in gas production. He also said global demand for gas may soften after 2025, and he doesn't expect production cuts in global gas supplies like in crude oil.

On the impact of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war on gas prices, Puri said, ""I don't expect supply lines to be disrupted, so I am not worried."" India imports about 50% of its gas requirements.

The inflation has come back to the Reserve Bank of India's comfort level of below 6% after a gap of two months. In July 2023, India's CPI stood at 7.44%, while in August 2023, it was at 6.83%.

Industrial output as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) was 10.3% in August 2023. Factory output measured in terms of the IIP had contracted by 0.7% in August 2022.

The data showed that the manufacturing sector's output increased by 9.3% in August 2023. Mining production rose 12.3% during the month under review. Power output grew 15.3% in August 2023. The IIP grew by 6.1% in April-August 2023 compared to 7.7 percent in the same period of 2022-23.

According to the CNBC-TV18 Poll of economists, the forecast CPI was estimated at 5.5%, and the August IIP was pegged at 9.5%.

The Reserve Bank of India mainly factors in retail inflation while arriving at its bi-monthly monetary policy. Industrial output, or factory output, is the closest approximation for measuring the economic activity of the country's business landscape.

Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist and Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said, ""The significant decline in retail inflation in September 2023 was unexpected, as was the significant increase in July. Positive and negative surprises in the last three months have been primarily influenced by food prices.""

""The core inflation, however, remained essentially benign during this roller coaster ride of retail inflation in India. The reduction in inflation would reassure the Reserve Bank of India and validate the central bank's decision to maintain its recent stance of unchanged policy rate. Nonetheless, even at this level, retail inflation remains significantly higher than the RBI's stated monetary policy target of 4%,"" Hajra added.

Rohit Arora, CEO and Co-Founder, Biz2Credit and Biz2X, said, ""The recent dip in the retail inflation rate to 5% in September, down from 7.4% a year ago, marks a welcome relief for consumers and the broader economy. This gradual easing of inflation, reflected in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), underscores the resilience of our financial ecosystem.""

""A lower inflation rate boosts purchasing power, giving consumers more confidence in their spending decisions. For the fintech sector, it means a more predictable environment for interest rates and lending conditions, setting the stage for continued growth and innovation.

Credit growth also continued to rise, signalling robust demand conditions in the Indian economy, as well as banks’ improved appetite towards retail borrowers, according to the seventeenth round of the FICCI-IBA survey.

The survey was carried out for the period January to June 2023. A total of 24 banks including public sector, private sector and foreign banks participated in the survey. These banks together represent about 79% of the banking industry, as classified by asset size.

The health of the banking sector has witnessed an encouraging turnaround, marked by healthier bank balance sheets and a gross NPA ratio at a decade-low.

The survey findings show that long-term credit demand has seen continued growth for sectors such as infrastructure, textiles and chemicals. food processing and metals. Iron and steel have also witnessed accelerated long-term loan disbursements in the past six months. Infrastructure is witnessing an increase in credit flow with 67% of the respondents indicating an increase in long-term loans as against 57% in the previous round.

The survey suggests that the outlook on expectation for growth of non-food industry credit over the next six months is optimistic with 42% of the participating banks expecting non-food industry credit growth to be above 12% (as compared to 36% in the previous round), the survey said.

Given the higher rates of interest, a shift towards term deposits has been observed. Over half of respondent banks (57%) reported a decrease in the share of CASA deposits in total deposits in the current round of the survey. The term deposits have picked up pace as reported by the respondent banks.

According to the survey, 54% of respondent banks reported that the credit standards for large enterprises have remained the same (83% of the banks reported so in the last round). In the current round of surveys, 29% of participating banks reported easing of credit standards, indicating continuous improvement in funding. For SMEs too, 68% of the respondents have reported no change in credit standards in the current survey round.

Turning to asset quality, 75% of the respondent banks reported a decrease in the NPA levels in the last six months as compared to 90% of banks that reported so in the previous round. 90% of public sector banks have cited a reduction in NPA levels while amongst participating private sector banks, 80% of banks have cited a decrease.

Amongst the sectors that continue to show high levels of NPAs, most of the participating bankers identified sectors such as infrastructure, textiles and food processing. Other sectors identified as high NPA sectors include metals, iron and steel and engineering goods.

Respondent banks were more sanguine about the asset quality prospects in the current round of the survey, cushioned by policy and regulatory support and this was reflected in the survey results. 54% of the respondent banks in the current round believe that Gross NPAs would be in the range of 3-4% over the next six months.

A resilient domestic economy, a pick up in credit growth supported by Government capex, robust recovery mechanism, high provisioning and high write-offs were cited as the key factors by respondent bankers who expect asset quality to further improve over the next six months. As per respondents, some of the sectors that may continue to show NPAs over the next six months include Textiles and garments, MSME, Aviation, Agriculture and Retail Trade.

Banks were further asked to share their level of preparedness regarding startup funding. Most banks reported that they are well-equipped in terms of capital and some of them have also set up start-up verticals catering to this requirement. Banks also suggested some additional measures that can be taken by banks to further improve the funding for the start-up ecosystem.

These included streamlining loan application and approval processes for start-ups which may be done in collaboration with fintech, establishing specialised divisions catering to special financial needs of start-ups, exploring alternate forms of collateral such as IPR, equity stakes, etc, partnering with incubators, accelerators and VCs; organising financial education workshops specifically for start-ups. In addition, it was also suggested that RBI may consider a separate liquidity window, wherein banks can source funds for on-lending to start-ups."

Foreign orders worth crores of rupees are now halted, and even orders which are ready could not be dispatched due to the war, according to a CNBC Awaaz report.

Firozabad is world-famous for its glass products, such as bangles and glassware. Before the Israel-Hamas conflict , the business was running smoothly as glass items made here were exported while the traders also received fresh overseas orders. They used to get orders for items like hanging decorations for Christmas, wax-filling flower pots, and numerous other glass products. However, this time, these orders have been put on hold, and it's estimated that the losses could range between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 crore, according to a CNBC Awaaz report.

The exporters and businessmen in Firozabad receive a majority of their orders during the festive season, especially for Christmas, from Israel, Palestine and many European countries. Due to the conflict, there is uncertainty over the orders already received and moreover, there is no scope for fresh orders. Apart from Israel, exports to other European countries have also been impacted significantly, according to the Firozabad glass manufacturers.

Santosh Agrawal, a glassware manufacturer, explained that earlier this year, they had received orders from foreign countries for glass products, but these deals are currently on hold. Reportedly, a significant number of orders had come from Palestine and its neighbouring countries, which are not being dispatched now due to the ongoing conflict, reported News18.

He noted that the Firozabad glass industry has been fearing a loss of thousands of crores as the overseas income accounts for about 50 per cent of their earnings. Many manufacturers and exporters had earlier received payments in advance for these orders and now, since the shipment is on hold, the exporters fear that they will have to return the money."

“I’m definitely in the school that rates will stay high for as far as the eye can see,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s David Westin and Romaine Bostick for Wall Street Week. “It seems the fundamentals point to having higher interest rates for a long time.”

The US Treasury 10-year yield has surged from 4.1% at the start of September to a peak of 4.88% last week, its highest level since 2007. The selloff has been spurred by resilient jobs data and sticky inflation.

Concerns that growing Federal deficits require higher yields to absorb more Treasury supply has been illustrated by a sharp rise in real or inflation-adjusted Treasury yields that suggest investors are demanding a higher premium to hold US debt.

“I think there are a lot of fundamentals pointing to high real rates,” said the Harvard University professor. He added that the US will need to spend more on defense, the green transition “is going to involve a lot of big investments,” and that the retreat of globalization is another factor “if only because China is slowing.”

What might reverse the current trend of higher rates? Any signs that they “start feeding back into the real economy and you start having an effect on investment,” Rogoff said

Asked whether the US economy can live with 5% interest rates, Rogoff replied, “Interest rates have gone up and maybe we will hit recession at some point, but the economy has not fallen apart as much as you think. The economy is adjusting.”

In June, Rogoff told Bloomberg the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would average above 4% for the rest of the decade."

Share Market Live NSE

""We are expecting just about a 50-bps cut. So, it will be a shallow rate-cut cycle,"" he told CNBC-TV18.

Ahya also shared his thoughts on the bond market and geopolitical changes in the Middle East.

Bonds and currencies in India and across Asia have encountered unforeseen challenges. The primary concern is the significant increase in US yields, which has surged by approximately 130 basis points since May.

Even though there has been a slight reduction in US yields, recent geopolitical changes in the Middle East have raised fresh concerns about oil prices, which, in turn, affect Asian bonds.

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:

Q: We have a plateful over here in terms of issues. But first, let me begin with the US bond yields. This time Asia, according to your report is not going to be impacted much.

A: Yes, that is right. I think the bulk of the rise in real rates that we have seen in the US has been driven by the fact that term premiums have gone up, and market expectations on the Fed policy rate hikes have not been much. So that is one important difference in terms of the rise in the US yields this time.

The second is that Asia's inflation outlook has been still quite comfortable. We are expecting that Asia is going to see 80% of the region’s central banks having inflation within their comfort zone or closer to target by the end of this month, when you get the data for the September quarter, everybody's inflation will have looked like it's within central bank's comfort zone. So, Asia does not have that big an inflation problem and so usually the way we think about this dynamic when US rates are going up is the fact that whether Asian central banks have their policy setting in a way that the macro stability indicators like inflation and current account balance are in a good position.

And when you try to answer that question, the answer is yes. Most of the countries in the region except for the Philippines have inflation and current account balances in a shape that central banks do not have to take up interest rate hikes.

And so, this is the main thought process behind which we are saying that Asia’s macro stability indicators are in good shape. We do not think central banks have to respond to this rise in US interest rates with higher policy rates.

Q: They may not do it with higher policy rates, but will they have to postpone rate cuts? I mean, can you really cut, say Indian repo rates, if the US yields are still climbing? Never mind even if the Fed has stopped; if the yields are climbing, will that be a bit of a challenge for the currency, and therefore will RBI desist from rate cuts?

A: That is right. We do not think that the central banks in the region will be able to cut interest rates when the US rates are rising up or the dollar is strengthening too much with Fed rate hike expectations going up. That is the reason why we have most of the region's central banks, which are about to be able to cut rates will be delayed till Q2 of next year. So that is the quarter ending June 2024 because we also expect that by that time Fed would have indirectly or directly indicated that they are not taking up more rate hikes and that they are actually about to cut interest rates.

So, we will need confirmation from the Fed that the Fed is done with this tightening cycle and it's about to embark on an easing cycle for Asian central banks to also be able to cut rates.

But the reason why we are thinking about some modest rate cuts in the region is that you will have a dynamic where inflation would have decelerated quite a lot and real rates would have been rising. That would be away from the policy stance that various central banks would have is that real rates would have implied that you are tightening monetary policy when it may not have been warranted.

Q: I will come back to Asia and India, but what is Morgan Stanley’s house view on US yields itself? This move in the 10-year from 3.5% in May-June, all the way to 4.85% was quite unexpected. And there has been a kneejerk 20 basis fall. So is a significant retracement expected, or is the medium-term range likely to be towards 5 because there is fiscal oversupply?

A: We are expecting rates to moderate from here and our thought process is that if you break up the 10-year bond yield trends into policy rate expectations and term premium. Both those aspects, we think, will support 10-year bond yield to go lower.

But the most important driver to our lower rates forecast is that the Fed will be cutting rates in the next calendar year by about 75 to 100 basis points. And that is what will create that environment for US 10-year rates to go down.

So, we have been of that view, and you are right, the recent rise was a surprise, and it was not in our forecast. But our US rates team is still maintaining that the trajectory of the 10-year bond yield is downward, closer to four-handle rather than staying at 5%.

Q: Four-handle, that is still a long way if we have to get closer to 4%, but coming back to India, how do you assess the Reserve Bank's response to the monetary policy? Why would they announce such an important step like an OMO, an open market sale that has pushed up yields considerably? Should that be read as a defense against US yields?

A: Yes, I would think so. I think the way we are seeing various Asian central banks - some of them are explicit like BoK, which mentions the Fed policy path and what is happening to the US rates. And RBI has been sort of more focused on the domestic inflation.

But it's very clear that somewhere in the back of the mind, the developments in the US rates and the Fed policy outlook are weighing on the RBI’s mind as well, and in an environment where oil prices had been rising, at least at the time when monetary policy decision got taken. They would have to consider the fact that you have a combination of higher US rates, higher dollar, and higher oil prices weighing on the inflation outlook.

So, they didn't want to sound in any way indicative that they are done, and they are going to cut rates because that will ease financial conditions and that will risk that the currency will depreciate, and I think that's really the main driver behind RBI’s increased hawkishness.

We do not think that the underlying inflation dynamic in India is right now warranting that shift and hawkishness but it's the outlook of that inflation affected by this, potential dollar rises, and higher oil is that has weighed on RBI’s mind.

Q: I am not trying to ask you your view on the new geopolitical problem in the Middle East, the Israel-Hamas war, but will Asia have to struggle with higher crude prices? Is that one of your base cases?

A: Right now, our oil analyst is not forecasting oil prices to rise meaningfully. Our forecast is that oil prices will average around $95/bbl in the fourth quarter of this year, and then head towards $85/bbl next year.

So, we are not expecting all prices to go up in our base case. But if it does go up because of these geopolitical tensions, it will definitely complicate the monetary policy management in the region.

And so, in that scenario, while I mentioned our base case, we are not expecting rate highs; in fact, we are expecting rate cuts to be happening, though in a delayed manner. In this risk scenario, where oil prices shoot up, we will see that there is a possibility that some of the central banks may have to pick up a rate hike.

Q: What is your RBI rate cut date?

A: We are forecasting a rate cut in the second quarter of 2024, and we are expecting just about a 50-bps cut. So, it will be a shallow rate-cut cycle.

Q: When you say second quarter you mean second calendar quarter, right? April-May-June?

A: That is right, the April to June quarter.

Q: On growth, the US yields are high, we hear about problems in the commercial real estate and with the 10-year yields, with the term premium also rising is there a chance that US growth and therefore global growth gets impacted. What would your take be for India if the global impulses are going to be weak?

A: First, on the US, we are expecting growth to slow from this quarter itself. There are a few things that are going on in the US. One, real rates are rising, and so monetary policy is gradually tightening. Second, we do not think we will get as much fiscal support and so fiscal impulse is not going to be positive like it was in the last 12 months. Third, there is going to be the student loans, repayment that will burden the consumers. And finally, the excess saving stock for the bottom 20% has exhausted. So, we are expecting consumption slowdown and overall growth slowdown in the US. In the context, this recent real rate rise has only added to that downward pressure because the US economy is funded to a large extent with long tenure borrowing. And therefore, we think that case that we have in our base case that there will be a slowdown is only getting more confirmed. Now, as far as India is concerned, this may not be a bad thing. So as long as the US is slowing, but not going into a deeper recession, it will be good for the region and India in the sense that it takes off this pressure of dollar rise and US higher rates but brings it down into a situation where you don't have a big downside to exports growth. So soft landing in the US even if it may be a deeper slowdown, it’s fine as long as you do not get a deeper recession.

Q: So, Indian growth, what is your number now?

A: We are at 6.4% for the current financial year. And the next financial year we are at around the same number – 6.5% on an average."

Speaking exclusively to CNBC-TV18, Sankar made it clear that the RBI's licensing approach does not differentiate between non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and other individuals applying for banking licences.

The decision to grant licences to fintech companies will be contingent on their ability to meet the specified regulatory requirements, the deputy governor pointed out.

Discussing the growth of unsecured personal loans, Sankar acknowledged that there were certain challenges posed by new entrants to the sector. However, he noted that the RBI has responded by issuing relevant regulations.

As the system adapts to these changes, the central bank anticipates a more stable environment, especially as new financial products are introduced, he said.

The deputy governor also shed light on the ongoing Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot, expressing optimism about reaching a milestone of one million transactions by the end of the year.

Currently, the CBDC pilot programme records approximately 15-20 thousand daily transactions. Recently, interoperability between CBDC and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was introduced.

Addressing the discussions with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), Sankar said that they have engaged in dialogue regarding a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and its potential contents.

Niobium is a vital component for various industries due to its remarkable properties.

Share Market Live NSE

It is a high-value metal, which has multiple usages across industries. The Union Cabinet has fixed a royalty rate of 3% on the Average Sale Price.

What is Niobium?

Niobium denoted as Nb in the periodic table, is a ductile refractory metal known for its resistance to heat, wear and corrosion. This element forms a surface oxide layer that enhances its durability. Its applications are diverse, ranging from daily-use items to cutting-edge technologies.

Key Usages of Niobium

In the Steel Industry: Approximately 90% of niobium is used in the steel industry, where it acts as a micro-alloy with iron. Even in small quantities (less than 1 %), niobium significantly enhances steel’s strength and reduces its weight. This results in the production of economical, lightweight products used in construction, gas and oil pipelines, and automotive industries. The use of niobium-containing steel has led to increased fuel efficiency and improved safety ratings in vehicles.

Superalloys: Niobium is a crucial component in nickel and nickel-iron superalloys, especially in applications requiring strength and heat resistance. These superalloys find applications in aeronautics, such as turbine blades in jet engines, and in the energy sector for gas turbines.

Superconductors: Niobium becomes a superconductor at extremely low temperatures. When alloyed with titanium or tin, it forms superconducting magnets utilised in medical imaging devices like MRI scanners, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) equipment and particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

Other Applications: Niobium is used in various other applications including glass production (for corrective spectacles and camera lenses), jewellery, prosthetics, medical implants, electronic circuits (niobium capacitors), sodium vapour lamps, and cutting tools.

Global Demand and Sources

The demand for niobium has risen globally due to several factors, including the need for high-quality steel in infrastructure projects in industrialising countries like China. Additionally, its applications in emerging technologies like superconductors for nuclear fusion reactors and magnetic levitation trains have contributed to the demand surge.

The primary source of niobium is the mineral columbite, which is found in countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, and Nigeria. It is also produced as a by-product of tin extraction."

Share Market Live NSE

Speaking at the 14th edition of KPMG’s Innovation and Energy Conclave, Puri said many important oil-producing countries are showing worrying signs, and availability and affordability of oil needs to be looked at.

Puri's statement comes as key OPEC+ members Saudi Arabia and Russia have continued with their policy of voluntary cuts. Saudi Arabia announced last week that it would continue with a voluntary cut of one million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of 2023, while Russia said it would keep a 3,00,000 bpd voluntary export curb until the end of December.

This resulted in oil jumping towards $100 a barrel for Brent crude, the highest since 2022. This led to the oil minister assuring that India would be able to manage oil prices above $100 per barrel , but it could lead to ""organised chaos"".

""India's energy demand will continue to provide fuel for future economic growth, as it grows exponentially: India is the world's 3rd largest consumer of oil, 3rd largest LPG consumer, 4th largest LNG importer, 4th largest refiner, 4th largest automobile market,"" he observed.

""My belief is if you have a large amount of liquidity then high oil prices mean a problem.""

Puri on Israel-Hamas conflict

Puri remained hopeful that India can navigate through the ongoing West Asian crisis if the oil supply lines were not disrupted. As per him, the union government has maintained a close watch on the situation.

""I think in the 5 days of the Hamas strikes and Israel’s military operations which look like getting escalated, I think the global markets will factor all things into account and if the supply lines are not disrupted, hopefully we will be able to navigate through.""

""If crude oil prices go up it has a very strong and adverse impact on efforts for global economic recovery,"" he added.

Puri also said at the conclave that the world is facing multiple crises at the moment, including in the food, fuel and fertiliser sectors.

“The world of energy is riddled with challenges on multiple fronts–increasing population, dwindling resources, environmental degradation, rising food and energy prices. The global energy trilemma challenge – security, affordability and sustainability, needs a nuanced approach especially taking the needs of the global south into consideration.”

The situation in West Asia remains tense as Israel continues to conduct airstrikes in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip to avenge the Saturday invasion.

Meanwhile, the possibility of a ground invasion remains high as Israel amasses over 3,00,000 troops near the Gaza border. Local media have reported PM Benjamin Netanyahu informing the US and Egyptian authorities about the possibility of conflict running for months.

Meanwhile, the possibility of a widening conflict remains high as Lebanon-based Hezbollah continues to fire small rockets into Northern Israel, showing solidarity with their ""Gazan brothers"".

'Close to achieving 20% ethanol blending'

Puri announced that India will soon achieve its target of 20% ethanol blending, much earlier than the set target. ""Very close to achieving 20% ethanol blending, it’s within sight,"" Puri said.

The government has set the target of achieving a remarkable 20% ethanol blending program by the year 2025. At present, the petrol available to consumers for use is mixed with only 10% ethanol.

Earlier this year, PM Narendra Modi rolled out 20% ethanol-blended petrol in select gas stations in 11 States and Union Territories (UT). The advantages cited for this move include reduced emissions and fewer foreign exchange-draining imports."

The competition watchdog is continuing to deliberate on a draft law aimed at addressing the challenges posed by digital markets.

Kaur said the CCI is actively involved with the Committee on Digital Competition Law, providing information when needed. She highlighted that changes in deal value thresholds are coming soon, which will help stop unfair competition, through agreements. Kaur explained that the CCI is keeping a close eye on Big Tech, global players, and gatekeeper platforms.

She also talked about the importance of working with competition authorities from other countries, although it may not entail doing the same things as the other countries.

She also mentioned the recent changes to the Competition Act in 2023. These changes are meant to address issues in the digital market, such as too much power in one company, companies favouring themselves, and companies making it hard for others to compete. A significant change being made is about how the value of deals between companies is measured.

""Very substantive amendments have been made in the Competition Act of 2023. Some have been notified, and some are in the process. They are meant to address the challenges we have faced in the recent past. A very important change that will come through is deal value thresholds. We are finding in the case of digital markets that they are not charging for the services. But in their use of data, there are a lot of issues. Data concentration, self-preferencing, anti-steering provisions are some of the issues. With a view to addressing those kinds of mergers and combinations... one could also look at killer acquisitions. Companies may be very small startups, but with a great deal of potential and the ability to promote competition. The deal value threshold is meant to capture those transactions,"" she said.

Kaur also said the CCI is trying to make rules that people can trust and make it easy for businesses to operate. The regulator is asking people for their opinions and will use those opinions to make better rules.

""We are also moving towards trust-based regulations; we are looking at settlements and commitments. Companies can come forward and make commitments so that markets can be corrected much quicker. We would play along as we are promoting ease of doing business. We have already started public consultation, and whatever inputs we have received, we are going to be working on them,"" Kaur added.

When asked about how artificial intelligence (AI) affects competition, Kaur said the regulator is very interested and is studying the market to understand it better.

""We can look at the possibility of any anti-competitive practices, and if so, how they can be addressed, whether we can do any self-regulation, so that also is going to be looked at by the Commission,"" Kaur said."

Share Market Live NSE

The industry revenues are estimated to grow, helped by volume growth and product mix benefits, the report based on a sample set of domestic alcobev companies said.

""Industry operating profit margin (OPM) to contract by ~90-140 basis points in FY24 due to input cost pressure, especially grain prices and packaging materials,"" it said.

The alcobev industry witnessed a strong revival in the last fiscal in FY23 led by a healthy demand across both segments -spirits and beer, after two consecutive pandemic-hit years of FY21 and FY22.

""During Q1 FY2024, the spirits industry reported a 13 percent YoY increase in revenues despite being the lean season for the segment, while the beer industry, despite being the peak season, witnessed a marginal decline of ~1%, due to the unseasonal rainfall,"" it said.

However, despite a steady demand, OPM of ICRA's sample set companies is poised to contract further by ~90-140 basis points in FY2024, following a sharp 300 basis points decline in FY2023,"" it said.

The primary reason for the expected margin contraction is the elevated prices of key inputs in the current fiscal, like non-basmati rice and other grains such as maize, used to produce extra neutral alcohol (ENA), the base to manufacture spirits.

The impact of a sub-par monsoon, the El Nino conditions, and the government measures on grain prices thus remain crucial to ascertain the industry cost structure. Besides, packing material costs also remain high, particularly glass, led by an increase in soda ash prices.

However, prices of barley, the key raw material for producing beer, have witnessed correction in recent quarters and are likely to remain stable in the near to medium term.

Moreover, the availability and consequent pricing pressures from the diversion of grains towards the production of ethanol, which is seeing increased demand due to the Government blending norms, is also a key influencing factor to monitor for the industry.

""While ICRA's sample set undertook a sizable capex at 5 percent of the revenues in FY2023, the same is expected to moderate to 2-3 percent in FY2024 and FY2025 as key players enhanced their capacities recently,"" it said.

Moreover, the majority of the ongoing capacity addition is attributed towards beer manufacturing, which is expected to come up in the near to medium term with some players looking to expand to new states and deepen penetration in the existing regions.

""ICRA expects the industry to continue to demonstrate stable and healthy credit metrics supported by strong cash flow generation and limited debt addition,"" it said."

Share Market Live NSE

“Growth in India is projected to remain strong, at 6.3 percent in both 2023 and 2024, with an upward revision of 0.2 percentage point for 2023, reflecting stronger-than-expected consumption during April-June,” the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook report for October, released on Tuesday during the ongoing IMF Annual Meetings in Marrakech, Morocco.

This compares with Reserve Bank of India’s projection of a 6.5 percent GDP growth for India for the current financial year, 0.2 percentage points higher than IMF’s latest forecast.

Over the medium term, the fund has forecast a 6.3 percent GDP growth for India by FY29. India’s consumer price inflation (CPI) is seen easing from an average of 6.7 percent in 2022 to 5.5 percent in 2023 and 4.6 percent in 2024, the IMF said.

Global Growth Outlook

The global economy is limping along, not sprinting, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in its report. It expects the world economic growth to slow from 3.5 percent in 2022 to 3 percent this year and 2.9 percent next year, a 0.1 percentage point downgrade for 2024 from its estimates released in July.

“The global economy continues to recover from the pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis. In retrospect, the resilience has been remarkable. Despite war-disrupted energy and food markets and unprecedented monetary tightening to combat decades-high inflation, economic activity has slowed but not stalled. Even so, growth remains slow and uneven, with widening divergences,” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the Economic Counselor and Director of the Research Department at IMF said in a blog.

For advanced economies, the expected slowdown is from 2.6 percent in 2022 to 1.5 percent in 2023 and 1.4 percent in 2024, amid stronger-than-expected US momentum but weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area. Emerging market and developing economies are projected to have growth modestly decline, from 4.1 percent in 2022 to 4.0 percent in both 2023 and 2024, with a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point in 2024, reflecting the property sector crisis in China, the fund said in its report.

“Forecasts for global growth over the medium term, at 3.1 percent, are at their lowest in decades, and prospects for countries to catch up to higher living standards are weak,” said the IMF.

Three forces are at play, noted Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas in a blog:

1. The recovery in services is almost complete and the strong demand that supported services-oriented economies is now softening.

2. Tighter credit conditions are weighing on housing markets, investment, and activity, more so in countries with a higher share of adjustable-rate mortgages or where households are less willing, or able, to dip into their savings. Firm bankruptcies are increasing in some economies, although from historically low levels. Countries are now at different points in their hiking cycle: advanced economies (except Japan) are near the peak, while some emerging market economies that started hiking earlier, such as Brazil and Chile, have already started easing.

3. Inflation and economic activity are shaped by last year’s commodity price shock. Economies heavily dependent on Russian energy imports saw a steeper increase in energy prices and a sharper slowdown. The passthrough from higher energy pri"

Policymakers are weighing the issuance of at least 1 trillion yuan ($137 billion) of additional sovereign debt for spending on infrastructure such as water conservancy projects, said the people, asking not be identified discussing a private matter. That could raise this year’s budget deficit to well above the 3% cap set in March, one of the people said. An announcement may come as early as this month, another person said, though deliberations are ongoing and the government’s plans could change.

The discussions underscore mounting concerns among China’s top leadership over the trajectory of the world’s second-largest economy and how growth compares to the US. It would also mark a shift in Beijing’s stance as the government has so far avoided broader fiscal stimulus despite a deepening property crisis and rising deflationary pressure that have put the growth goal of around 5% for the year at risk.

The country’s economic slowdown has weighed on everything from Chinese stocks to commodity prices and the results of multinational companies such as Nike Inc. and LVMH.

China has long been trying to keep its official fiscal deficit — which excludes special bonds or debt borrowed by local government financing vehicles — under 3% of GDP partly to control financial risks. But calls to loosen the limit by state-linked think tanks and economists at global firms have grown louder in recent years as fiscal stress built up in a slowing economy.

The plans, led by the Ministry of Finance and the National Development and Reform Commission, are subject to final approval by the State Council and legislators, the people added. The MOF and the NDRC didn’t immediately reply to faxes seeking comments.

The Chinese government has stepped up stimulus in recent months with piecemeal actions. It has lowered key interest rates, freed up more long-term cash into the banking system, added support for housing sales and household consumption, and accelerated the issuance of special local government bonds since August.

While some sectors have shown initial signs of a pickup, the broader economic outlook remains uncertain. Home sales continued falling and the recovery in domestic consumption was slower than expected over this month’s critical holiday period, underlining subdued confidence that’s holding back households and private businesses from spending.

Economists have repeatedly cut their growth forecasts for this year to 5%, now in line with China’s annual goal that was deemed conservative when it was set in March.

A further deceleration in growth would add more depreciation pressure on an already-weak Chinese currency, leading capital to leave the country and exposing the nation’s financial markets to potential turmoil. Anemic economic expansion also means fewer new jobs to be created, worsening the unemployment situation and endangering social stability.

Using a large chunk of income from treasury note issuance to fund infrastructure spending — a key way Beijing taps to drive economic growth during down-cycles — has been unusual since Chinese provinces were allowed to sell special bonds for that purpose in 2015.

By raising the budget deficit ceiling, the government can sell more general-purpose bonds to fund infrastructure construction, and reduce the interest payment pressure on local authorities which mainly rely on the more costly special bonds for such funding, some economists have said.

Share Market Live NSE

Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson on Monday told a conference that he would “remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields” in assessing “the future path of policy,” echoing similar comments from other policymakers in recent days.

The key question for officials is whether the recent increase in borrowing costs reflects investor expectations for a stronger economy or just extra compensation required to bear interest-rate risk. Parsing it will probably keep them on hold at least through their next rate decision on November 1.

“The markets all of a sudden are doing all the dirty work for the Fed,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, a senior US economist at BNP Paribas SA. “It seems like the majority, including some of the more hawkish policymakers, are OK with proceeding more cautiously.”

Yields on 10-year Treasury securities have risen about 40 basis points since the Fed’s September 19-20 policy meeting — to 4.8% as of Friday’s close. (Cash trading was closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday.) Projections published after the meeting showed most officials expected one more rate hike this year — and fewer cuts next year — would be needed to return inflation to 2%.

Earlier on Monday, speaking at the same conference as Jefferson, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan indicated that if risk premiums in the bond market are on the rise, that “could do some of the work of cooling the economy for us, leaving less need for additional monetary policy tightening.”

Logan’s comments at the National Association for Business Economics gathering jibed with similar remarks from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who said on October 5 that “if financial conditions, which have tightened considerably in the past 90 days, remain tight, the need for us to take further action is diminished.”

Investors currently see little chance of a rate hike at the October 31 - November 1 meeting, and are assigning less-than-even odds to any additional tightening in 2023, according to futures.

Policymakers aren’t ready to put an official pin on the tightening cycle just yet. Jefferson on Monday said he was “particularly attentive to upside risks to inflation, such as those associated with the economy and labor market remaining too strong to achieve further disinflation.”

Still, inflation has come down this year, and forecasters generally expect a monthly BLS report on consumer prices due Oct. 12 to show it decelerated further in September, according to a Bloomberg survey.

“The improvement in inflation is why they can be patient, and the run-up in yields is the reason why they should be patient,” said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC.

A broad increase in borrowing costs across many debt securities amplifies the impact of monetary policy, and raises the risk “of a nonlinear response in terms of fragility and financial stability,” Crandall said."

The GST Council on Saturday decided to exempt extra-neutral alcohol (ENA), a key ingredient used in manufacturing alcohol for human consumption, from the levy. The Council gave states the exclusive right to tax them.

Share Market Live NSE

According to the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC), the reduction of GST on molasses from 28% to 5%, has the potential to save Rs 400-500 crore per annum for the industry. Still, since states control the prices of alcohol in India, the benefit is unlikely to be passed on.

“The reality is that most of the ENA is used in alcoholic beverages, so very little goes to the pharma industry or cosmetic industry. The biggest impact will be on the Indian-made foreign liquor sector. The prices are not within the control of the companies so they may not be able to pass on any reduction in cost to the consumer,” Vinod Giri, Director General, CIABC told CNBC-TV18.

Elaborating on it further, Giri said, “In India mostly, 70% of states decide the price of the alcohol. And they are reluctant to cut it as their excise revenue collections are based on certain pricing and volume. So they are a bit reluctant to experiment with that, they are risk averse, so states normally don't allow any price reduction.”

The 52nd meeting of the GST council took place on Saturday in New Delhi wherein the body decided to exempt ENA from the levy when used for human consumption and left it for states to decide. Similarly, when ENA is supplied for industrial use, states will not levy any tax and it will be taxed at 18% under GST. Another crucial decision taken by the council was to reduce GST from 28% to 5% on Molasses.

Giri shared that just the reduction in molasses rates alone will likely save Rs 400-500 crore per annum for the industry.

“IMFL industry uses roughly about say 140 -150 crore litres of ENA every year. Nearly 65% of that, which is 100 crore litres, is actually traded. So someone produces and someone else is busy bottling it and making it into their products. Now a GST of 18%, if applicable, would have hit this Rs 100 crore litre of ENA. Looking at today’s price of about Rs 68-70 per litre, we are looking at ENA traded at Rs 6800-7000 crore and with an 18% levy, we are looking at around Rs 1,000 crore of GST burden every year on the industry.""

Giri added, ""However, unlike any other industry where a manufacturer can pass on the GST to consumers, if applicable, in the case of alcohol, most states control its pricing. One-third of ENA used in the country is from molasses. And about 65% is being bought from other parties. We are looking at 65% of 50 crore litre, on that 23% of savings, would mean Rs 400-500cr in annual savings.”"

Currently, Henry Lee Professor of Economics at Harvard University, Claudia Goldin has been awarded the ultimate honour for, “providing the first comprehensive account of women’s earnings and labour market participation through the centuries,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in its press release.

Share Market Live NSE

Indeed every inch of Goldin’s work is devoted to when where and why women have been paid less than men and under what circumstances can the gender gap be reduced.

In her early years, she trawled through the archives and collected 200 years of data from the US and demonstrated how and why there are gender differences in compensation and in types of jobs.

Goldin’s path-breaking research showed that female participation in the labour market decreased with the transition from an agrarian to an industrial society in the early nineteenth century, but then started to increase with the growth of the service sector in the early twentieth century.

Goldin explained that this change came about because of a change in social norms and medical advances. For instance, access to the contraceptive pill played a revolutionary role in helping women plan their careers.

Social acceptance of family planning helped, but the gender gap continued due to the influence of parents and family. According to Goldin, part of the explanation for the gender gap is that educational decisions, which impact a lifetime of career opportunities, are made at a relatively young age. Often expectations of young women are formed by the experiences of previous generations — for instance, their mothers, who did not go back to work after the birth of children.

Harvard University, where she teaches lists over 80 research papers from Goldin covering a wide swathe of issues related to the nature of women’s employment and compensation.

Her recent books include:

1)Women Working Longer—Increased Employment at Older Ages Edited by Goldin along with Lawrence F. Katz and published by University of Chicago Press, 2018.

2)The Race Between Education and Technology written by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, published by Harvard University Press, 2008

During the twentieth century, women’s education levels continuously increased, and in most high-income countries they are now substantially higher than for men, Goldin proves in some of her papers. Her latest book published in 2021 by Princeton University Press titled “Career & Family: Women’s Century Old Journey Toward Equity” tackles what is holding women back from equal pay even after better education than men. The book shows how many professions are “greedy,” paying disproportionately more for long hours and weekend work, and how this perpetuates disparities between women and men.

The book includes her work during the Covid years when she says women suffered because daycares and schools closed. Goldin says COVID-19 impacted women’s employment and labor force participation more relative to men. But the big divide was less between men and women than it was between the more- and the less-educated. The more educated could work from home. The less educated in service jobs lost.

Contrary to many accounts, she proves that women did not exit the labor force in large numbers, and they did not greatly decrease their hours of work. The aggregate female labor force participation rate did not plummet. The real story of women during the pandemic concerns the fact that employed women who were educating their children, and working adult daughters who were caring for their parents, were stressed because they were in the labor force, not because they left

Goldin concludes that book with the hope that the acceptance of remote working may be the pandemic’s silver lining, But that’s not enough. Career and Family explains why we must make fundamental changes to the way we work and how we value caregiving if we are ever to achieve gender equality and couple equity.

One hopes that the award of the ultimate prize to Goldin will force employers, governments and societies to discuss and consider Goldin’s advice and ensure a better blend of work ethic and caregiving."
