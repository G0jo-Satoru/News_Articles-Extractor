Start your day with everything you need to know about the markets and economy

Avoid “all forms of exuberance”, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das warned the country’s lending institutions on Wednesday.

Last week, the central bank had increased risk weights on unsecured personal loans, credit cards and lending to non-bank finance companies by 25 percentage points. On Wednesday, the RBI governor said the tightening was “pre-emptive in nature; they are calibrated and targeted.”"

US Treasury yields are still near two-month lows and oil prices are edging lower. All of this, the finance ministry says in its latest monthly economic report, is good news for India.Does it mean we are out of the woods? Not entirely. The optimism is tempered with some caution — the Indian government and central bank are on “high alert” because of the downside risks from inflation. In fact, uncertainties related to higher food and energy prices, and geopolitical tensions mean a recession could appear in 2024, the finance ministry says."

The next calendar year will be of two halves, wherein the government spending before the upcoming General Elections will be the key driver for growth, while after the elections, it will be the re-acceleration in investment growth, especially from the private sector, Goldman Sachs said in a report.From a fiscal year perspective, the brokerage said it expects growth to accelerate to 6.5 per cent for FY25 from the 6.2 per cent it has projected for the ongoing FY24, it added.""India has the best structural growth prospects in the region. We believe GDP growth is likely to stay robust at 6.3 per cent y-o-y (year-on-year) in 2024,"" the brokerage said, adding the country is less sensitive to potential external shocks like longer rates globally, persistent dollar strength and geopolitical uncertainties.The brokerage said risks around the growth outlook are evenly balanced but added that ""the main domestic risk"" is emanating from political uncertainty, with elections approaching in the April-June quarter of 2024.The election season is already underway with Assembly polls in five states, which will be followed by the General Elections later, it said, adding that outcomes of these elections will be ""keenly watched"" by investors from the standpoint of economic reforms and/or policy continuity.It expects headline consumer price inflation to come at 5.1 per cent for 2024, against 4.7 per cent estimated by the Reserve Bank. This will, however, be lower than the 5.7 per cent expected in 2023, it added.""We expect the government to intervene through subsidies or other measures to keep a lid on food prices in an election year,"" it said.The ""somewhat elevated"" inflation relative to the target will limit the room for monetary easing, and the RBI will cut rates by only 0.50 per cent to 6 per cent by early 2025, the brokerage said, adding that there will be a cut of 0.25 per cent each in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025.The current account deficit will widen to 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2024 from the 1.3 per cent expected in 2023, but the rupee is set to appreciate to 82 against the dollar at 2024-end against the 83 level at the end of 2023, it noted."

Digital transactions recorded by Unified Payments Interface surged about 40% in October from a year earlier.India’s festive season usually runs for several weeks until the Hindu religious holiday of Diwali — which takes place on November 12 this year — with millions of Indians often binging on food, gifts and home improvements.The sales are a key indicator of the health of consumption, which makes up about 60% of India’s gross domestic product.Economists point to an easing in inflation and a pickup in wages, especially in the rural countryside, where a majority of India’s population live. Consumer confidence reached a four-year high in September, the latest central bank figures show, while demand for bank loans is hovering near a 12-year high despite interest rate hikes this year.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is also targeting farmers ahead of elections, giving them higher guaranteed prices on some crops and curbing cooking gas costs.“Both urban and rural consumption are entering the festive season on a much stronger footing,” Yuvika Singhal and Vivek Kumar, economists at Quanteco Research, wrote in a report last week. The continuing fiscal support directed toward rural areas ahead of polls could further boost consumption in the sector, they said.Stronger spending is helping to drive manufacturing activity in Asia’s third-largest economy and underpinning growth of more than 6% in the current fiscal year that ends in March. The International Monetary Fund predicts India’s economy will grow 6.3% in both 2023 and 2024 — the fastest pace among major economies.Consumer businesses are reporting stronger sales, while banks like Axis Bank Ltd. are betting on a pickup in business momentum in the next few months. Reliance Retail said in a statement last week that it saw “strong shopping” during recent festivals.On top of the festive period, consumption will likely also get a boost from the Cricket World Cup and the upcoming wedding season.The cricket tournament is being hosted in cities across India until November 19, with some economists estimating it could add $2.6 billion to the economy as fans spend on travel and eating out. The Confederation of All India Traders, the country’s largest traders group, expects the wedding season, which runs from November 23 to December 15, will result in $50 billion of spending on items like gold jewelry, clothing and other consumer goods.“The festive season is expected to be followed by a robust wedding period, both of which combined should support near-term growth,” Teresa John, an economist at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities Pvt, said last week. “Easy availability of credit and expectations of cooling inflation should also aid a gradual recovery in discretionary spending particularly in the mass market.”Online sales from Amazon, Flipkart and others reached 47 billion rupees ($565 million) in the week through October 15, consulting firm RedSeer said in a report. Mobile phones, electronic goods and large appliances drove around 67% of the sales, it said.UPI, which records real-time digital payments, processed transactions worth 16.46 trillion rupees from October 1-30, an increase of more than 40% from a year earlier. Credit card payments jumped 16% to 1.42 trillion rupees in September, data from the Reserve Bank of India shows.Other high frequency indicators paint a similar picture of strong consumption:Goods and services tax collection rose 10% from a year earlier to 1.6 trillion rupees in SeptemberPeak electricity demand, a key barometer for activity in industrial and manufacturing sectors, surged to an all-time high of 240 gigawatts in September, topping the government’s forecastsFactory floors are also buzzing, with manufacturers adding more capacity to keep up with the strong demand.“We have healthy orders across most of the verticals led by mobile phones, LED televisions and washing machines,” Saurabh Gupta, chief financial officer at Dixon Technologies Ltd., one of the country’s largest contract manufacturers, said earlier this month. Dixon had introduced multiple shifts across the majority of its 20 factories to meet its order pipeline."

In the new report, the economists at the country's largest lender SBI also pitched for a ""reinterpretation of old-fashioned rhetoric"" while looking at a subject like employment.""India's unemployment rate is at a record low, India's labour market is undergoing a deep structural transformation with self-entrepreneurship across all echelons and higher educational attainment emerging as key enablers,"" the report said.It ruled that the jump in self-employed populace within the employment estimates (57.3 per cent in FY23 now against 52.2 per cent in FY18) with the main traction coming from the rising share of household helpers evidentially has been wrongfully interpreted by labour economists and others as a signal of shrinking employment opportunities.The government's emphasis on entrepreneurship through the Prime Minister's Mudra Yojana (PMMY) and post-pandemic schemes like PM-SVANidhi for those at the bottom of the pyramid is ""imparting a structural transformation in labour markets in India through the formalisation of credit for such family enterprises"", the report said.Earnings have increased across all categories, the report said, adding that with primary subsistence needs like food, shelter, and medical needs being taken care of by the government through free ration for 80 crore people, PMAY and Ayushman Bharat, apart from additional state schemes, such people are making a clear trade-off between earnings and working in family enterprises."

The index has since dropped around 3% but was still up almost 8% for the year.While that run puts India as one of the best performing markets - the BSE index has risen in nine of the past 10 years - it also makes it expensive compared to regional peers and other major indices.The BSE's current price-to-earnings ratio of 21.45 was only second to the US S&P 500 ratio of 23.11 according to LSEG data.But still nearly 90% of analysts, 22 of 25, who answered an additional question in the November 10-22 poll said Indian stocks would hit record highs in the coming six months.The sensex was expected to gain over 6% from Monday's close of 65,655.15 to a lifetime high of 70,000 by mid-2024, an upgrade from 68,578 in an August poll.It was then forecast to add another 3.6% to reach 72,500 by end-2024, according to the median forecast of 29 analysts.India's economy is the fastest growing among major economies and is expected to grow over 6% in the next couple of years.

But having said that, I think India remains one of the well-favoured markets,"" said Rajat Agarwal, Asia equity strategist at Societe Generale.""Growth is resilient and the macro momentum has been strong and that should continue to be the case in 2024 as well.""The strong run-up in domestic equity prices may be due to the rise in young Indian investors fuelling the boom at a time when the country has overtaken China as the most populous in the world.""A combination of better financial literacy and increased access to financial services has led to a surge in mutual fund accounts (typically used by retail investors), from under 60 million in 2016 to over 150 million now,"" noted Shilan Shah, deputy chief EM economist at Capital Economics.Asked about expectations for corporate earnings over the coming six months all 27 respondents said they would increase.""Earnings actually extended by more than 20% this year. So we already have a high base. I think earnings should increase, but we might not really have the kind of growth we saw in the last year,"" added Agarwal.Two-thirds of analysts, 16 of 24, said value stocks would perform better over growth stocks in the coming six months.""In an environment where interest rates are high, or are expected to be high if not go up further, value typically does better,"" said Nishit Master, portfolio manager at Axis Securities.""We are not going back to the 0% interest rates or 1% or 2% global interest rates any time soon.

A travesty repeated again with the unplanned, sudden lockdown on 24th March, 2020 which led to lakhs of migrant workers walking hundreds and thousands of km back home,"" he said.""Who can forget the Prime Minister mocking people's suffering, laughing and saying 'ghar mein shadi hai, paisa nahi hai'? Who can forget the hundreds of poor and middle-class people who died waiting in long lines to convert their notes, even as the wealthy managed to exchange their banknotes with ease,"" he said.""Demonetisation along with a badly designed and hurriedly rushed through GST finished off India's job-generating small and medium businesses, caused a 45-year unemployment high, and ended the economic recovery that had begun in 2013, all while failing to achieve any of its stated objectives.""It led to a record concentration of wealth and power, particularly among a handful of large monopolies that have sustained the BJP financially even as the people continue to grapple with joblessness and price rise caused by the same monopolisation,"" Ramesh charged.""In addition to devastating the economy and concentrating wealth in the hands of a few people, the Modi government has 'blood on its hands' for a reckless demonetisation. India will not forgive the prime minister for this monumental disaster,"" he said.The Congress leader claimed that demonetisation led to destruction of the economy and the GDP growth momentum created from 2011 onwards was completely reversed. India's GDP growth rate increased steadily from 5.2 per cent in 2011 to 8.3 per cent in 2016.Then, the demonetisation disaster hit, and growth started to slow, all the way to four per cent just before the Covid-19 pandemic, he noted.He said the economic damage of demonetisation is obvious no matter what data you look at and an IMF report from August 2018 said there was a “severe and long-lasting” impact on growth, with a “disproportionate impact on the informal sector.”A study from Brown University found that demonetisation led to a large drop in consumption, forcing poorer households to go into debt, he claimed.The MSME sector, which depends on the cash economy and provides the majority of employment in India , was devastated, he alleged.Ramesh also said it led to the failure to achieve objectives, saying, ""Demonetisation was a monumental blunder that failed to achieve any of the shifting goalposts that the Modi government had proposed as objectives—whether reducing the spread of black money, ending counterfeiting or making India cashless.""He also claimed that that 99.3 per cent of the demonetised notes were returned to the RBI making it a complete and total failure of exposing any black money.Demonetisation, he charged, was carried out ""with haste, incompetence, and with a total and complete disregard to expert advice from the RBI"".He also noted that over 100 people died in queues and stampedes, trying to access their own money."

This is why, within just one month, employment opportunities under MGNREGA have decreased by more than 28%.The reason for the decline in employment is the reduction in the budget for MGNREGA by the central government.Selja said that the CMIE ( Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy ) report reveals that the unemployment rate among people aged 15 years and above has increased to more than 10% in the country after 29 months. This is the highest rate after the COVID period. Before this, in May 2021, it was 11.84%. The recent increase in the unemployment rate is due to the rise in unemployment in rural areas. She said that in September, MGNREGA provided employment to 19.53 crore people, but in October, this number decreased to 14.03 crore. This means that employment decreased by 28.16% in just one month.

This is why, within just one month, employment opportunities under MGNREGA have decreased by more than 28%.The reason for the decline in employment is the reduction in the budget for MGNREGA by the central government.Selja said that the CMIE ( Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy ) report reveals that the unemployment rate among people aged 15 years and above has increased to more than 10% in the country after 29 months. This is the highest rate after the COVID period. Before this, in May 2021, it was 11.84%. The recent increase in the unemployment rate is due to the rise in unemployment in rural areas. She said that in September, MGNREGA provided employment to 19.53 crore people, but in October, this number decreased to 14.03 crore. This means that employment decreased by 28.16% in just one month.

Home, Car Loan RBI new guidelines: Latest RBI rules for EMIs, loan switch, penalty explained

EMIs set to go up further? Global markets are closely watching the tense geopolitical situation in Europe and the Middle East. There have been fluctuations in oil prices in recent weeks, raising concerns of a potential spike. Experts suggest that this could prompt the Reserve Bank of India to take action on interest rates, an ET report states.RBI’s rate hike cycle, which started in May 2022, has seen a pause in the last few MPC meetings.Since last year, RBI has hiked the repo rate by 250 basis points, resulting in banks increasing their lending rates, hence impacting the EMIs of loan borrowers. Any further repo rate hikes by the central bank will potentially lead to higher EMIs for loan borrowers.According to Morgan Stanley, India, as a net oil importer, is seen as a promising option with one of the best long-term prospects globally. However, there are challenges to this positive outlook. Morgan Stanley 's Chief Asia Economist, Chetan Ahya, has highlighted that if the US raises interest rates while oil prices continue to rise and sustainably cross the $110 per barrel mark, it could strain India's economic stability and put pressure on its currency.Despite the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, crude prices have remained relatively stable over the past month. Nevertheless, on Monday, prices rose after Saudi Arabia and Russia announced their commitment to maintain oil supply restrictions of over 1 million barrels per day until the end of the year.While the US Federal Reserve recently decided to keep interest rates unchanged, it has made it clear that it will not hesitate to raise rates if inflation is above comfort.As of November 2, India's average crude oil basket price was $87.09 per barrel, slightly lower than the October average of $90.08. On Monday, Brent crude oil was trading at over $85 per barrel.Morgan Stanley's note has emphasized that if oil prices sustainably rise to $110 per barrel, it could strain India's macroeconomic stability, leading the Reserve Bank of India to resume its rate hike cycle. Despite inflation exceeding the central bank's median target, it has maintained the interest rates unchanged in the past four meetings. The RBI's inflation forecasts are based on the premise of a crude oil price at $85 per barrel in the second half of FY24.Morgan Stanley has warned that oil surpassing the $110 per barrel threshold could have destabilizing effects on India's economy. This could result in higher domestic fuel prices and secondary inflationary pressures. Additionally, the current account deficit may exceed the comfortable threshold of 2.5% of the gross domestic product.Morgan Stanley's base case scenario assumes that oil prices will sustain at $95 per barrel, which would be more manageable for the Indian economy . In this case, the Reserve Bank of India is likely to delay any interest rate cuts.The World Bank has estimated that global oil prices will average $90 per barrel in the fourth quarter. However, it has cautioned that an escalation in the Middle East conflict could significantly increase prices. The Deputy Chief Economist of the World Bank, Ayhan Kose, stated that higher oil prices would inevitably lead to higher food prices, particularly in developing countries where food price inflation is already elevated."

It has also set another record by handling 4.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in just 203 days, which is faster than the previous financial year.The port has expanded its portfolio by adding new cargo types, such as Hydrolysis Pi Gas (HPG). In 2023, it has already docked over 2,480 ships and serviced more than 11,500 rakes.Mundra Port's strategic location and deep draft capabilities have made it well-equipped to handle large vessels. In July 2023, it berthed one of the largest ships ever, the MV MSC Hamburg, which is 399 meters long and 54 meters wide, with a carrying capacity of 15,908 TEUs. In 2021, it berthed the APL Raffles, the largest container vessel to call at any Indian port, with a length of 397.88 meters and a width of 51 meters.The port also enjoys strong connectivity with the hinterland, particularly to the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC).

India is highly vulnerable to rising crude prices as it is the third-largest consumer of oil. A $10 increase in oil prices leads to higher inflation and widens the current account balance. If oil prices rise above $110, it would result in higher domestic fuel prices, inflationary effects, and a widening current account deficit."

Murthy made this request to youngsters in the debut episode of “The Record”, a video series by 3one4 Capital. My request is that our youngsters must say: ""This is my country, I want to work 70 hours a week.”In conversation with former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai , Narayana Murthy stressed on the need to pick the right habits from the West.“Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the west and then not helping the country,” he said.Talking about the rise of emerging markets and especially that of China, Murthy said, “If we can look at countries that have made significant progress in the last 25-30 years. Why I'm saying 25-30 years is then they would have gone through some ups and downs, they have gone through some difficulties. If they can look at a country like China, if they can look at other countries that have made significant progress economically, and then say what are the policy decisions they took so that they could grow very well, then I believe that we would also grow.”Murthy strongly advocated for bureaucratic efficiency to make India more competitive globally. “...unless we reduce the delays in our bureaucracy in taking decisions, we will not be able to compete with those countries that have made tremendous progress.""He lamented that India's work productivity is one of the lowest in the world. “Unless we improve our work productivity, unless we reduce corruption in the government, you know some level, because we have been reading I don't know the truth of that, unless we reduce the delays in our bureaucracy in taking decision we will not be able to compete with those countries that have made tremendous progress,” Murthy said.Murthy gave the example of how corporates and governments in Germany and Japan decided to rebuild their countries after the second world war. “...they made sure that every German worked extra hours for a certain number of years. So I hope our leaders too will be able to, when I say leaders, corporate leaders too, will be able to address our youngsters and say (that) for the first time India has received certain respect. This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress and for doing that we need to work very hard. We need to be disciplined and improve our work productivity,” Murthy said.According to Murthy, every government is as good as the culture of the people. “Our culture has to change to that of highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking people. That transformation has to come to youngsters because youngsters form a significant majority of our population at this point of time.

According to PTI, the report states that India's GDP is expected to reach $7.3 trillion by 2030, making it the world's third-largest economy. The Indian economy has shown strong growth in recent years, with a projected GDP growth of 6.2-6.3% in the fiscal year ending in March 2024.India's rapid economic expansion is driven by strong domestic demand and increased foreign direct investment inflows. According to S&P, the surge in foreign direct investment entering India in the last decade mirrors the positive long-term economic growth prospects for the country. This is supported by a youthful demographic structure and the swift increase in urban household incomes.India's nominal GDP, measured in USD terms, is predicted to grow from $3.5 trillion in 2022 to $7.3 trillion by 2030. This rapid expansion is expected to propel India's GDP ahead of Japan's, making it the second-largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region by 2030. Already, India's GDP surpassed that of the UK and France by 2022 and is forecast to exceed Germany's by 2030.Currently, the United States maintains the world's largest economy with a GDP of $25.5 trillion, accounting for a quarter of the world's GDP. China is the second-largest economy, with a GDP of around $18 trillion, constituting nearly 17.9% of the global GDP. Japan ranks third with a GDP of $4.2 trillion, followed by Germany with $4 trillion.S&P Global highlights several key drivers supporting India's long-term economic prospects, including its large and rapidly growing middle class, driving consumer spending. India's expanding domestic consumer market and substantial industrial sector have made it an increasingly attractive investment destination for various multinational corporations in sectors like manufacturing, infrastructure, and services, it says.The ongoing digital transformation in India is anticipated to accelerate e-commerce growth and reshape the retail consumer market over the next decade. This transformation has attracted leading global technology and e-commerce multinationals to the Indian market.S&P Global projects that by 2030, more than 1.1 billion Indians will have internet access, more than doubling from the estimated 500 million internet users in 2020. This rapid growth in e-commerce, along with advancements in 4G and 5G smartphone technology, is expected to benefit homegrown unicorn companies such as Mensa Brands (online e-commerce), Delhivery (logistics startup), and BigBasket (online grocer).India has witnessed a significant increase in foreign direct investment over the past five years, with this momentum continuing even during the pandemic years of 2020-2022. Notably, large investments from global technology giants like Google and Facebook have contributed to this trend drawn by India's substantial and fast-growing domestic consumer market. There has also been a strong upturn in foreign direct investment inflows from manufacturing firms.Overall, India is poised to remain one of the world's fastest-growing economies over the next decade, making it a crucial long-term growth market for multinational companies across various industries, including manufacturing, electronics, chemicals, banking, insurance, asset management, healthcare, and information technology, says S&P."

It is one of the world's oldest and second-largest stock exchanges by market capitalisation, after the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Knight noted that India has ""a very strong legal system...very strong universities"" and ""all the ingredients that have produced and could continue to produce great early-stage companies, innovation and technological innovation"".""But,"" he said, ""you need capital and the capital needs of India have continued to grow with its success.”As India grows from a demographic perspective and the economy advances, the country needs better infrastructure and that will require capital to be built, Knight said.""You need capital for startup companies. So from NASDAQ's perspective, we feel we could bring the global investor more directly involved in the Indian economy and bring more capital to India,” Knight said.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, he said, has already talked about putting rules in place that would allow Indian companies to list in the United States.“We have over a hundred Israeli companies that are listed in the United States. That's done with complete cooperation with the Israeli government and also with the Tel Aviv stock exchange. Their view is that capital from the United States through IPOs at NASDAQ goes back to their country and helps grow their economy. It makes the pie bigger for everyone. And I think we could have a similar dynamic in India if the rules allow it,” Knight said in response to a question.The NASDAQ official said there is a fairly obvious focus on India now as it becomes more difficult to invest in China.“So it's a natural progression and what we see in our own company and in the companies who list on NASDAQ is an increased interest in having a more secure supply chain and investing more in India,” he said.The US and India, Knight said, are making a major effort to engage through cooperation to create opportunities for the people of both countries.“Growth and jobs are important to both the countries. And those are a product often of early stage high growth companies. The conditions to create those companies and for those companies to be successful are sometimes hard to duplicate. We have them here in Silicon Valley in the United States. India has it in certain parts of its country, but we want to broaden that opportunity, learn from each other,” he said."

The Islamic Republic supplies arms and cash to Hamas, which the US and European Union designate as a terrorist group, and backs the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon.The Israel-Hamas conflict comes on top of Russia’s protracted war on Ukraine and simmering superpower tensions between the US and China. The following charts show countries more exposed to a higher-for-longer dollar and oil price.“If higher oil prices persist for a prolonged period, we see India, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia more vulnerable to terms of trade deterioration,” said Lavanya Venkateswaran, a senior economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd. “Moreover, as ‘twin deficit’ economies — current account and fiscal deficits — they may be more vulnerable to capital outflows.”Alicia Garcia Herrero at French investment bank Natixis SA said high external debt positions mean Sri Lanka and Pakistan are most at risk. Indonesia and India are also vulnerable “since they tend to run current-account deficits and need external financing for that,” she said.Compounding the problem, US Treasury yields have soared on concerns that higher oil prices will revive inflation pressures. That’s another headwind for nations running high budget deficits as they’ll likely struggle to raise funds in global markets, Garcia Herrero added.The chart above shows emerging Asian bonds have become less attractive for investors — the premiums a borrower pays to own Indian or Indonesian bonds against US debt, for example, have hit the lowest level since at least the 2008-09 global financial crisis.Strategists at HSBC Holdings Plc say they prefer the Chinese renminbi and the Korean won among low-yielding Asian currencies. They highlight Beijing’s tight focus on fine-tuning fiscal policy and recent property market measures and the Bank of Korea’s consistent foreign exchange sales and the country’s potential inclusion in a global bond index next year.“The other low-yielding currencies not only do not have these supportive factors, they also have certain individual shortcomings,” the HSBC strategists wrote, pointing to election uncertainty for the Taiwanese dollar, deteriorating fiscal metrics for the Thai Baht and overvaluation for the Singapore dollar.“Among higher-yielding currencies, we have a slight preference for the Philippine peso and the Indian rupee over the Indonesia rupiah,” they said.One country that stands to benefit from rising oil prices is Malaysia, in terms of both growth and the nation’s fiscal position, economists said.“We see increased export duties, petroleum income taxes, and dividends from the state-owned Petronas to be adding to the fiscal revenue,” said Bum Ki Son, Singapore-based regional economist at Barclays Plc. “For Indonesia, we think the fiscal position is likely to deteriorate.”Economists see some positives for India despite the higher dollar and elevated oil prices.

The Islamic Republic supplies arms and cash to Hamas, which the US and European Union designate as a terrorist group, and backs the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon.The Israel-Hamas conflict comes on top of Russia’s protracted war on Ukraine and simmering superpower tensions between the US and China. The following charts show countries more exposed to a higher-for-longer dollar and oil price.“If higher oil prices persist for a prolonged period, we see India, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia more vulnerable to terms of trade deterioration,” said Lavanya Venkateswaran, a senior economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd. “Moreover, as ‘twin deficit’ economies — current account and fiscal deficits — they may be more vulnerable to capital outflows.”Alicia Garcia Herrero at French investment bank Natixis SA said high external debt positions mean Sri Lanka and Pakistan are most at risk. Indonesia and India are also vulnerable “since they tend to run current-account deficits and need external financing for that,” she said.Compounding the problem, US Treasury yields have soared on concerns that higher oil prices will revive inflation pressures. That’s another headwind for nations running high budget deficits as they’ll likely struggle to raise funds in global markets, Garcia Herrero added.The chart above shows emerging Asian bonds have become less attractive for investors — the premiums a borrower pays to own Indian or Indonesian bonds against US debt, for example, have hit the lowest level since at least the 2008-09 global financial crisis.Strategists at HSBC Holdings Plc say they prefer the Chinese renminbi and the Korean won among low-yielding Asian currencies. They highlight Beijing’s tight focus on fine-tuning fiscal policy and recent property market measures and the Bank of Korea’s consistent foreign exchange sales and the country’s potential inclusion in a global bond index next year.“The other low-yielding currencies not only do not have these supportive factors, they also have certain individual shortcomings,” the HSBC strategists wrote, pointing to election uncertainty for the Taiwanese dollar, deteriorating fiscal metrics for the Thai Baht and overvaluation for the Singapore dollar.“Among higher-yielding currencies, we have a slight preference for the Philippine peso and the Indian rupee over the Indonesia rupiah,” they said.One country that stands to benefit from rising oil prices is Malaysia, in terms of both growth and the nation’s fiscal position, economists said.“We see increased export duties, petroleum income taxes, and dividends from the state-owned Petronas to be adding to the fiscal revenue,” said Bum Ki Son, Singapore-based regional economist at Barclays Plc. “For Indonesia, we think the fiscal position is likely to deteriorate.”Economists see some positives for India despite the higher dollar and elevated oil prices.

India GDP Growth Explained: Road To Indian Economy Becoming World’s 3rd Largest | Deep Dive Analysis

India’s impressive recent economic gains are unlikely to displace China as the world economy’s main growth engine anytime soon, according to HSBC Holdings Plc. “The numbers don’t exactly add up,” economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote in a report Friday. India, at the moment, “runs on too few cylinders,” while China is “simply too large to have its importance for the world economy readily eclipsed,” they said.HSBC expects the gap between the two economies to continue to widen in the foreseeable future, expanding to $17.5 trillion by 2028, based on IMF forecasts.That is equal to the current size of the European Union’s economy. The gap between the two stood at $15 trillion last year.The bank’s take is in stark contrast to the bullish outlook by others, such as Barclays Plc., that earlier this week said a steady 8% expansion for India will enable it to topple China as a global growth driver in the next five years. The HSBC report also hghlights the difference in consumption and investment trends between the two Asian giants.Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s, the economists wrote. Currently, China accounts for around 30% of world investment, while India’s share is less than 5%. Its share in global consumption also stands below 4%, compared to Beijing’s 14%.Despite this, the economists do expect India will make a hefty contribution to world demand for commodities, consumption and capital goods, making the HSBC economists “bullish on India.”The South Asian country will likely become a “far bigger player in global trade, possibly attaining a similar, key role in services exports as China occupies in goods supply chains today,” they said.The International Monetary Fund forecasts India’s economy to grow at 6.3% each in 2023 and 2024, while China’s economy should grow at 5% and 4.2%, in that same period."

Industries are always concerned, and they ask for consistency in policy to ensure growth in economic activities ,"" FM told students at the Shri Ram College of Commerce.She said the economy had emerged as the fifth largest due to efforts from farmers, entrepreneurs and others. The comments came ahead of crucial general elections next year where a coalition of parties, which call themselves INDIA, are seeking to end BJP's two-term run. Modi and his party colleagues have argued that they have provided stability to help the economy emerge from the Covid-crisis and become the fastest growing major economy. ""There cannot be a more volatile macroeconomic situation globally. I am talking about the global situation, not just India. In that situation, what is actually guaranteed?"" she said.The minister also flagged concern over supply disruption in certain areas, such as food and fertiliser. Since the war in Ukraine started over a year ago, governments across the world have been grappling with shortages, which have also pushed up prices of essential commodities including oil and fertiliser, and imposed a heavy subsidy burden at a time when inflation has trended up and growth in several parts of the world has slowed down significantly. High inflation has prompted central banks across most parts of the globe, including India, to raise interest rates.""You need governments that are futuristic, ready for reforms and provide consistency for businesses to grow. That's exactly the difference when it comes to the kind of decisions the Modi government has taken and which didn't happen earlier, pulling the country backward,"" Sitharaman said.The minister also said the Modi government's approach was not to ""entitle people"" but ""empower"" them, offering a choice by spending on fundamental things and providing access to resources and essential facilities like housing, roads, drinking water and toilets. She said policy continuity had helped India have a steady flow of foreign direct investment and that the recent move to include India in JP Morgan's bond index for emerging markets raised the prospects of around $23 billion flowing into the country.Sitharaman, who will travel to Morocco next week for the annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF, also called for a reform of multilateral agencies."

ICC World Cup 2023 expected to inject $2.6 Billion into India's Economy, here's how

The Cricket World Cup may boost host country India’s economy by as much as 220 billion rupees ($2.6 billion), economists at Bank of Baroda estimate.The quadrennial tournament, which starts on Thursday and runs through mid-November, is expected to draw large numbers of visiting fans domestically and internationally. With the matches played across 10 cities, that will mostly benefit the travel as well as hospitality sectors, wrote economists Jahnavi Prabhakar and Aditi Gupta in a note Wednesday.The event, which is being hosted in India for the first time since 2011, also coincides with the three-month festive season that started in September and will be particularly beneficial for the retail sector as many people will make “sentimental purchases of merchandise,” they added.The economists expect total Indian viewership for the tournament, including both on television and streaming platforms, to be far larger than the 552 million seen in 2019. That may generate 105 billion rupees to 120 billion rupees in TV rights and sponsorship revenue “on a conservative basis.”The tournament which coincides with the festive season in India would give a boost to overall retail demand, the researchers said. The three-month long festive season started in September.However, the World Cup may also fan inflation. Airline tickets, hotel rentals have surged for the period, and service charges in the informal sector in the 10 host cities could show substantial increases on top of the festive-season impact, the economists said. Overall, inflation may rise between 0.15%-0.25% for October and November, they said.The tournament will also support Indian government coffers through increased tax collections on ticket sales, goods and services taxes on hotels, restaurants and food delivery, giving the country additional fiscal space, the economists added."

A 10-second advertising slot during matches costs up to 3 million rupees, a 40% increase compared to the last World Cup in 2019, he said.""Demand for eyeballs is really strong,"" Thakkar added.Amid an economic slowdown in China and its geopolitical tensions with Western economies, India's thriving consumer market is emerging as a sweet spot for global companies looking for growth. The South Asian nation is expected to drive a fifth of world economic expansion in the next decade and become a $10 trillion economy by 2035, according to some estimates.Cricket is by far the most popular sport in India, and attracts more than $1.5 billion in sponsorship and media spend a year, according to research from Jefferies, representing 85% of all such sports-related spending.""Cricket has less fanfare globally as compared to other sports like soccer,"" said Sabnavis, ""but the kind of frenzy you witness in India around cricket is not present elsewhere.""Among the brands that are paying for airtime during the World Cup are large corporate names such as Coca-Cola Co, Alphabet Inc's Google Pay and Unilever Plc's India unit Hindustan Unilever Ltd, while the ICC 's list of official partners includes Saudi Aramco, Emirates and Nissan Motor Co.The roster of brands on display shows a shift back to more traditional sectors such as consumer goods, automobiles and phones, said Thakker, as education technology and online betting companies that were once major sponsors cut back on spending amid debt and regulatory concerns.Disney Star, which holds the exclusive TV broadcast rights for the World Cup in India, said in a statement Wednesday that it is partnering with 26 sponsors including Booking.com BV and liquor company Diageo Plc.The Indian economy will also be getting a major boost in household spending during the World Cup, as fans travel for matches, watch them in venues like restaurants and bars or order takeout at home. Hotel fares have increased by 150% on average on days India is scheduled to play, according to a note by Jefferies analyst Prateek Kumar.Companies are also expecting a strong December quarter as the World Cup coincides with India's festive season, which runs from September to January. Diwali, for example, falls in mid-November just as the tournament draws to a close.""The Cricket World Cup is the biggest sporting event of the year for fans across the country,"" said Yannick Colaco, co-founder of FanCode, the International Cricket Council 's official retail partner in India for the event.

FAQs Answered | IPO Investment Guide

Capex revival in works: This year, the fresh capital raised through initial public offerings ( IPOs ) has hit its highest level in over a decade, reports ET. This signifies the anticipated resurgence in capital expenditure by India's private sector which believes that the rapidly growing economy will soon stretch the current capacities.Out of the total initial public offering proceeds of Rs 27,435 crore announced or collected in 2023, approximately half come from fresh issues.This means that these funds will be injected into the capital structure of the issuers, either to finance capital assets or to retire existing debt garnered for capacity expansion.For instance, JSW Infrastructure's Rs 2,800-crore public offering consists entirely of primary shares. 88% of Samhi Hotels' Rs 1,370-crore public offering consists of primary shares. Recent IPOs, including those by SignatureGlobal, Yatra Online, and Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services, also feature significant fresh issue components, ranging from 70% to 85%.Bankers note that companies are gearing up for an economic expansion and are making capital investments to capitalize on the expected boom. Dharmesh Mehta, MD & CEO of DAM Capital, explained that most recent public issues come from the manufacturing sector, seeking substantial capital infusion for both capital expenditure and acquisitions. He added that these corporations are strategically preparing for growth, buoyed by a positive outlook.In 2023, around 50% of the IPOs that successfully raised funds are from the manufacturing sector, while 35% belong to other capital-intensive industries like hotels, hospitals, logistics, and construction. Notably, the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector accounted for only two IPOs this year.Abhijit Tare, CEO-Investment Banking at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, pointed out that companies, amidst the market enthusiasm, are actively securing fresh capital to strengthen their balance sheets for future growth. Many mid-level companies are expanding their capacity to align with the China+1 strategy, while others are preparing for capacity-building under Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes.In the past decade leading up to 2022, IPOs were primarily used for meeting internal financial needs, with most funds directed towards existing shareholders. In 2022, only 30% of the total funding of Rs 59,302 crore came from primary issuances, with the remaining Rs 41,643 crore raised through the sale of existing holdings by investors, according to data from Prime Database. This marked a decline from the 36% ratio observed in 2021. The ratio was a meager 13% ratio in 2020.In the first quarter of FY24, projects worth Rs 5.96 lakh crore were announced, the highest in five years. While the government has been driving investments in recent years, private capital expenditure, which has a substantial impact on economic growth and job creation, has lagged behind."

But, there is still a long way to go to realise India's full potential, Goyal added.""The UPA government inherited a strong economy and benefitted from a high growth period.""But over-reaction to the global financial crisis after 2008 and many corruption scandals weakened the economy,"" she told PTI.Goyal was asked how she would compare the performance of the UPA government's ten years (2004-14) and the Modi-led NDA government's nine years in office.""The (Modi-led) NDA inherited double deficits (high fiscal deficit and high current account deficit), high inflation and weak banks, but has improved all these, and implemented other reforms so that the economy has begun to do well now even in an unsupportive global environment,"" she asserted.Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office for the first time in May 2014. Modi led the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a majority of its own in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.On some US-based economists' claim that India is overstating economic growth, Goyal said it is absurd to over-interpret quarterly results that are subject to seasonal and base effects as well as measurement issues.""Q1 growth is high because of the base effect due to a steep fall in growth to -23.2 in Q1 FY21 during the pandemic.""Growth rebounded to 21.6 in Q1FY22, 13.1 in Q1FY23, and 7.8 in Q1 FY24,"" she explained.Last month, India recorded GDP growth of 7.8 per cent during the April-June period of 2023-24, the highest in the past four quarters.While observing that the corresponding annual rates of growth in the last three fiscal years were -6.6 per cent, 9.1 per cent, and 7.2 per cent, she said the base effect is slowly fading, but this does not mean growth is decelerating.""All kinds of data indicators suggest growth is robust,"" she said, adding that annual growth above 6 per cent is excellent during a global slowdown.Noting that some US-based Indian-origin economists had argued that the fall in Indian growth in the 2020s was because of fundamental flaws that persist, Goyal said India's robust post-pandemic recovery has proved them wrong.According to her, if there were fundamental problems, then India would not have done so well despite continuing global shocks.""They (US-based economists) are wrong again in clutching at straws in quarterly growth rates,"" she said, adding that after the pandemic, as better data comes in, growth rates have been revised upwards, not downwards as they expected.The eminent economist asserted that Indian growth is sustainable because of the growing economic diversity, resilience, strength and efforts of so many Indians and policy that is smoothing shocks.Last week, the Finance Ministry also dismissed the criticism of inflated GDP, saying it has followed the consistent practice of using the income side estimates to compute economic growth, and stressed many international agencies have revised upwards their forecast after seeing the first quarter data.The critics, the ministry had said, should have looked at other data like purchasing managers' indices, bank credit growth, increase in capital expenditure and consumption patterns to assess the growth.India's real GDP growth was 7.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis in Q1 FY24, as per the Income or Production Approach.Recently, former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, in an article, argued that India's GDP is not measured from the expenditure side rather than the productivity side.Earlier this month, Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran rejected criticism of ""statistical discrepancy"" in the first quarter GDP data, saying when the same statistical authority reported the severest contraction in the first quarter of 2020, the naysayers had called it credible as it suited their narrative.The article was written in light of debates over India's economic performance and economist Ashoka Mody, a Princeton University professor, raising concerns regarding the country's GDP growth rate for the first quarter of the financial year 2023-24."

The report is not the official view of the central bank but is authored by RBI staff, including deputy governor Michael Patra.“The Indian economy remains an outlier amidst darkening global prospects. Supply chain pressures in India remain below historical average levels despite a pickup since May 2023. Our economic activity index now casts GDP growth for Q2 FY24 at 6.6%,” the report said.It also said that private final consumption expenditure, which is the mainstay of aggregate demand with a share of 57.3% in GDP, grew 6%. It added that the government’s infrastructure thrust and ‘exuberant real estate activity’ has resulted in gross fixed capital formation growing by 8%, maintaining its share at 34.7% of GDP.“Acceleration in investment activity is also corroborated by robust growth in steel consumption, cement production, capital goods production and imports,” the report said.The report has cited rising e-way bill volumes, retailers stockpiling goods ahead of the festive season, and a rise in toll collection used as a proxy for economic activity."

The space industry plays a key role across several application areas, including weather forecasting, geological and oceanographic studies, disaster management and agriculture, to name a few.It has also played a crucial role in the country's defence and security. Currently, India accounts for about 2 per cent of the global space economy, but this share is set to grow exponentially with rising private participation.Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya L1 will boost India's capability to undertake complex space missions that contribute to the advancement of space technology for the betterment of humanity, the authors said.Small steps became a giant leap in a 'moonshot serenaded' around the world when Chandrayaan-3 touched down on the south pole of the moon on August 23, it added."

Do you expect inflation to moderate and the growth rate to pick up?

How do you see developments in China impacting growth in Asia and

the world?

What is your outlook on India, which many believe will be among the fastest growing major economies over the next few years?

There is a lot of discussion around the reform of multilateral development banks. How do you view the report of the

Independent Expert Group

, and do you see countries ready to infuse more capital?

What reforms is ADB undertaking to adjust to new global challenges?

One of the issues flagged by the Independent Expert Group is leveraging more private capital and coordinating with other MDBs. Is the bank doing enough?

Asian Development Bank president Masatsugu Asakawa is in India to attend the G20 Summit. Responding to a questionnaire from TOI, he said India is on a promising growth path and strong domestic demand will act as a buffer against external slowdown. He also elaborated on how ADB is seeking to revamp operations to meet new challenges, a key agenda item for the summit.Excerpts:Global demand will be weaker this year than in 2022, though economic activity in advanced economies has slowed less sharply than we expected. First-half growth in the US and Japan has surprised on the upside, and the euro area avoided a technical recession. Global growth will continue to slow this year and into 2024, as the aggressive hikes by the US Fed and European Central Bank feed into these economies and into global financial conditions. High interest rates and slowing demand also mean that global inflation should continue moderating this year and the next. In our region, we expect developing Asia and the Pacific's growth to be close to 5% this year and the next. But downside risks to the regional outlook have intensified, including due to weakness in the People's Republic of China's property market.The momentum from China's reopening in the first half is waning, and headwinds from weaker global demand and domestic real estate are gaining strength. Some moderation is expected. China's growth has been slowing for several years and could continue for reasons including ageing, rebalancing from investment to consumption, and shifting to a new growth phase driven less by low-cost labour and more by innovation. Chinese authorities seek ""high quality"" growth that could fend off financial risks, foster environmentally sustainable growth, and reduce rural-urban inequalities. Countries that export final goods and services to China, and those that export inputs used for domestic production, especially construction, will be most susceptible to a property-induced slowdown.Indian economy is clearly on a promising growth trajectory. The government's strong emphasis on physical infrastructure development and ease of doing business should significantly enhance competitiveness. Rapid advancements in digital infrastructure are laying the groundwork for innovative breakthroughs across various sectors. India's long-term economic growth is underpinned by the steady expansion of working population and the middle class. Nevertheless, uncertainties due to Russian invasion of Ukraine and cautious growth prospects in advanced economies could impact the Indian economy, especially if there is volatility in global commodity markets. However, domestic demand should act as a buffer against external demand slowdowns. To maintain India's growth trajectory, robust private investments would be crucial. It is important that growth is more job-intensive, less carbon-intensive, and climate resilient.It's clear that the challenges we face both in Asia Pacific and globally are immense. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) must take bold action to help address these challenges. ADB welcomes efforts by all parties to ensure MDBs are well equipped to play this role, and the Independent Expert Group is an important contributor to this conversation. Mobilising adequate resources is an important goal - that's why ADB has been optimising its balance sheet through a capital adequacy framework review, which has the potential to mobilise billions of extra dollars of support for our member countries annually.ADB has embarked on a range of reforms to respond to new challenges, including to help deliver global public goods. Financial innovations and balance sheet optimisation will be crucial. ADB has nearly completed a review of its capital adequacy framework to explore how adjustments such as redefining risk tolerance and optimising balance sheets can create more headroom for increased lending. This will help to mobilise billions of additional resources to finance critical global and regional public goods. We are also conducting a major review of our Strategy 2030, to ensure that new development challenges and public goods are fully reflected in our corporate priorities, alongside strategies for bold impact.This year, we introduced our New Operating Model, a major reorganisation which enables ADB to increase its capacity as the region's climate bank, strengthen its work to develop the private sector and mobilise private investments in the region.The balance sheets of all MDBs combined will still fall massively short compared to the huge financing needs of our region. MDBs bring billions of dollars to the table, however, trillions are needed to meet investment needs for adaptation and mitigation, disaster resilience, and broader sustainable development goals. Private capital mobilisation is the key to moving from billions to trillions. This is why a private sector shift was explicitly targeted in ADB's New Operating Model - to improve our ability to integrate private sector solutions at every level of our operations."

Although it remained strong at 60.0 it was below July's 13-year peak of 62.2.Foreign demand was its highest since the series began in September 2014.The business outlook for the next 12 months was the most robust since December, encouraging firms to hire at the fastest pace in nine months.However, inflationary pressures quickened and the prices charged index reached a peak last seen in June, even though input prices rose at a slower pace.""Favourable demand trends also led to the joint-fastest increase in prices charged for Indian services in over six years, which may prompt attention from policymakers and potentially delay cuts to the benchmark repo rate,"" De Lima added.India's inflation is expected to remain above the Reserve Bank of India's target range of 2%-6% until at least October. But the central bank is forecast to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 6.50% until end-March, followed by a 25 basis-point cut in April-June.Despite India's manufacturing activity expanding at a three-month high in August, slower services growth meant the overall S&P Global India Composite PMI Output Index cooled to 60.9 last month from 61.9."

It’s in a geopolitical sweet spot, with Modi seeking to assert leadership of the so-called Global South amid support from the US to counter Beijing.But behind the bullish population growth lies a serious youth unemployment problem, and for every billionaire there are still hundreds of thousands in poverty, unable to access the nascent consumer market that has multinational companies flocking to the country.Booming India is a salve for global investors in the face of a slowing China.

Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war, and recessions in developed countries, India came out as the fastest growing economy in the past two years. India has become the fifth largest economy in terms of size of gross domestic product,” Goyal said.While thanking industries that played a role in the economic development of the nation, he appreciated the remarkable growth of Tirupur, which he touted as the fastest growing textile hub in the country with an export business volume of ₹35,000 crore.“Two-thirds of the Indian population is in the working age. In most other countries, two-thirds of their population is dependent on the working age. In the next 30 years, India will continue to have a young population whose average age will be less than 30 years.

NEW DELHI: India's economy grew at its fastest pace in a year in the June quarter, supported by strong services activity and robust demand, data released by the government showed on Thursday. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.8% in the April to June quarter, accelerating from the 6.1% growth recorded in the March quarter.* Strong services sector growth: The industrial growth rate (PMI manufacturing) is on a continued expansion zone, which signals neither expanding nor cooling manufacturing sector.The core industry growth rates are also positive.* Urban demand remains resilient: Passenger vehicle sales grew very strongly in Q1 FY24, compared to last year. Credit & debit card spending also witnessed rapid growth.* Recovery in rural remand: Anecdotal information from high value FMCG companies shows that growth is not just concentrated in metros but even small towns & villages. There is a pickup in rural demand for FMCG items.* Services sector has been the main driver of growth while industry has remained more or less unchanged* Government's capital expenditure push is now paying off. It has been championing the capex creation bandwagon over the last 6 years.India emerges as the fastest economy. India's real GDP growth towers above various GDP estimates of other countries* There is no real cause for concern that inflation would spike out of control as both the government and the Reserve Bank are taking adequate steps to maintain supply and keep prices under check.* The external sector remains stable despite concerns. The current account deficit has further narrowed in Q4 FY 2023. It is quite stable and well within our tolerance limit.* A slowdown in the global economy and trade may moderate export growth but it may be better for India overall. Prolonged geopolitical unvertainty and tighter financial conditions also pose a risk.* Inflation trajectory, while it is being extremely well managed, will continue to require attention on the part of fiscal and monetary authorities.* GST system is now benefiting both central and state governments. It's a sign of maturation.The nominal GDP growth was 8% and real GDP was 7.8% signal that there is momentum in economic activity in general and is not related to price-related distortions.

49,TOI,Explained: Why India’s credit rating should be upgraded from lowest investment grade - watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explained-why-indias-credit-rating-should-be-upgraded-from-lowest-investment-grade-watch-video/articleshow/103193078.cms,"TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Aug 30, 2023, 09:16 (IST)","Why India’s Credit Rating Should Be Upgraded | Fastest Growing Economy But Lowest Investment Grade

India’s sovereign credit rating across all major rating agencies be it S&P Global, Fitch or Moody’s stands at the lowest investment grade. This is the case for an economy which is amongst the fastest growing in the world. Not only that, the Indian economy is set to become the third largest economy in the world in the coming years.So why then is its sovereign credit rating so low? And is there a credible case for India’s rating to be upgraded? In this week’s episode of TOI Business Bytes, Madan Sabnavis the Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda explains the importance of a good credit rating and what parameters rating agencies typically look at to decide the investment grade.Sabnavis tells TOI, “A credit rating is a rating which is given to a particular country, which tells you whether there is any possibility of a default. If a particular country is able to honor all its debt commitments, then it would ideally be in a AAA-rated stage, and as this ability to service debt keeps coming down, it could be moving downwards, right up to BBB which is considered to be the lowest level of investment grade.”Watch the video above to know why Madan Sabnavis thinks that there is a strong case for India’s credit rating to be upgraded and why emerging markets cannot be measured with the same yardstick as the developed world. He also lays emphasis on the fact that India is an attractive destination for foreign investors and how 100% of the debt is denominated in rupees.India’s credit rating currently stands at BBB- for S&P and Fitch and Baa3 for Moody’s. Any grade below this is “speculative” and the credit risk rises as you move down to the “D” rating which indicates default. Madan Sabnavis is of the view that India deserves not just a basic upgrade but one to a level of at least A. “I think that India definitely does deserve an upgrade and upgrade also of a significant level, not just from BBB- to say BBB, it's more in the level of round A at a minimum,” he says.Sabnavis also talks about how India has come a long way from the fear of being accorded the “junk” status and how despite a high fiscal deficit, a robust reforms situation and the credible handling of the global pandemic situation in terms of liquidity management all warrant a thumbs up from rating agencies in the form of an upgrade."
50,TOI,India's real estate sector to grow multifold to about $6 trillion by 2047: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-real-estate-sector-to-grow-multifold-to-about-6-trillion-by-2047-report/articleshow/103108698.cms,"ANI / Aug 27, 2023, 20:25 (IST)","NEW DELHI: India’s real estate sector is expected to expand to $5.8 trillion by 2047 when the country celebrates its 100th year of Independence, according to a report. The current real estate is estimated to be about $477 billion.The report released by real estate consultant Knight Frank India in association with the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) stated this estimated real estate output value will contribute 15.5 per cent to the total economic output in 2047 from existing 7.3 per cent.Private equity investments in the Indian real estate sector have consistently grown over the past two decades.Projections for 2023 indicate that PE investments in Indian real estate are poised to reach $5.6 billion, reflecting a YoY growth of 5.3 per cent. On India’s overall economy, the size of India’s economy is estimated to range between $33 trillion to $40 trillion. As per estimates, the Indian economy is currently at $3.4 trillion. With India’s GDP expected to reach $36.4 trillion by 2047, the private equity investments within the Indian real estate sector are projected to surge to $54.3 billion by 2047, signifying a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 9.5 per cent spanning 2023 to 2047.“Significant expansion of the Indian economy by 2047, will be powered by Real Estate. A multifold economic expansion will boost demand across all the asset classes - residential, commercial, warehousing, industrial land developments etc - will grow at a multiplier rate to accommodate the growing needs of the economy and consumption needs of the individuals,” said Rajan Bandelkar, president Naredco.According to Knight Frank India, there will be an estimated 230 million units of housing requirement in India cumulatively in the next 25 years. In terms of market value, the residential market has the potential to generate an output equivalent of $3.5 trillion in 2047, it said. It is expected that with the changing income profiles, the demand for housing will emerge across all the pricecategories. In the next few years, while the demand for housing will remain concentrated in affordable housing, it will gradually shift towards mid segment and luxury housing.""The share of lower-income households will reduce from existing 43 per cent currently to 9 per cent in 2047. Thus, a significant share of the population will shift to lower-middle and upper-middle-income categories. This will enable a significant demand for mid-segment housing. Additionally, the share of HNIs (high net-worth individuals) and UHNIs (ultra-high-net-worth individuals) households in India which will likely increase from the existing 3 per cent to 9 per cent in 2047 will generate a significant demand for luxury housing inIndia,” it said.Further, as per Knight Frank estimates, 69 per cent of the working population will be formally employed to support the economic expansion by 2047.In terms of market value, the estimated office stock is likely to generate a potential output equivalent to $473 billion in 2047. It said the office stock has grown significantly from 278 million sq ft in 2008 to 898 mn sq ft cumulatively across theleading eight cities in India in 2022.“The next 25 years are going to witness a dramatic transformation in the Indian economy and the real estate sector. Factors like demographic advantages, improving business and investment sentiments, and government policy push towards high-value output sectors such as manufacturing, infrastructure etc. will robustly support the economic expansion of India,” said Shishir Baijal, chairman & managing director, Knight Frank."

A multifold economic expansion will boost demand across all the asset classes- residential, commercial, warehousing, industrial land developments etc. - will grow at a multiplier rate to accommodate the growing needs of the economy and consumption needs of the individuals,"" Bandelkar said.The report suggests that Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) could extend beyond offices and retail spaces to include residential, warehousing, and other sectors. Developers may also explore REITs for various asset classes like data centers, hospitality, and education.The report anticipates changing income profiles will lead to housing demand across all price categories. While affordable housing will initially be in demand, there will be a gradual shift towards mid and luxury segments.The proportion of lower income households is expected to decrease from 43 per cent to 9 per cent by 2047, resulting in more middle-income and upper middle-income groups driving mid-segment housing demand.Niranjan Hiranandani, National Vice Chairman of NAREDCO, opined: ""PMO's ambitious project, Housing for All, will propel the sustainable demand for residential housing across the spectrum. A strong foundation for the upward cyclical growth of the real estate sector is being laid by the Government of India and the regulatory authorities.""""Growing GDP will stimulate commercial and industrial real estate growth, attracting global investors towards Grade A assets. Emerging alternative asset classes will also play a critical role in pooling investments and boosting investors' confidence,"" he added."

In recent years, countries across the world have erected trade barriers, which include restrictions on imports and exports.PM also underlined the need to focus on small businesses and give them equal opportunities to compete, including in ecommerce. “For us, MSME means Maximum Support to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises,” said Modi, while elaborating on how India has integrated MSMEs into public procurement through online platforms, such as, GeM (Government e-marketplace) and Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC).Speaking about the proposed ‘Jaipur Initiative to foster seamless flow of information to MSMEs, Modi said this will address the challenge of inadequate access to market, and lack of information faced by MSMEs. He added that upgrading global trade helpdesk will increase participation of MSMEs in international trade. Even though MSMEs contribute equally to the world GDP and account for 60%-70% of the workforce, they are deprived of a level-playing field , he said. Pointing to the global optimism and confidence in the Indian economy , PM said India is seen as a combination of openness, opportunities, and options."

GST revenue collection: Record Breaking GST Collection, Impact on Indian Economy | GST Reform

The Indian economy is likely to have grown at 7.8% in the April-June 2023 quarter, a recent survey of economists conducted by ET says. The GDP growth is largely expected to have been driven by strong domestic demand, government investments, and a tentative recovery in private investment. These may have acted as a buffer against the ongoing global economic slowdown.The estimated range of GDP growth stood between 7.5% and 8.5% in the poll.This GDP growth will be a step up from the 7.2% growth in the previous fiscal year and the 6.1% growth in the preceding March quarter.However, the median forecast of 7.8% from the ET poll is slightly below the 8% projection by RBI’s for the first quarter of the current fiscal. The official first-quarter GDP data will be released by the government on August 31.Experts polled by ET are optimistic about the quarter's outlook, predicting broad-based growth. Yuvika Singhal from QuantEco noted the role of agricultural value addition in this trajectory, supported by the success of the 2022-23 rabi output.Economists highlight the services sector as the prime contributor to Q1's growth, complemented by robust construction activities. Indicators of air and rail travel underline steady demand in the transport sector, though some moderation is expected due to capacity limitations, points Rahul Bajoria of Barclays.Government capital expenditure, both at the central and state levels, contributed to the acceleration of construction activities. Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist at ICRA, emphasized the positive effect of enhanced investment activity and governmentcapital expenditure on Q1 FY2024's economic activity.While there's strong momentum in various areas, challenges are evident. Certain sectors like mining and exports may be a drag to growth, says Bajoria adding that the latter may be impacted by external pressures and weakening demand. Factors like unseasonal heavy rains that disrupted production & logistics may have affected growth as well.""Unseasonal heavy rains, the lagged effect of the monetary tightening, and weak external demand exerted downward pressure on GDP growth,"" Nayar said.In the initial quarter of FY24, capital spending by states increased by 76%, with the central government's capex growing by 59.1% compared to the previous year.The manufacturing sector also demonstrated robust growth due to lower commodity prices, which bolstered margins despite rising volumes. However, corporate activity's growth wasn't broad based.Yet, analysts anticipate a shift in momentum over the upcoming quarters. The effects of higher interest rates, coupled with a global economic slowdown, are likely to temper growth. The consensus among 22 economists polled by ET points to a median growth rate of 6.2% for the full fiscal year, which is below RBI's 6.5% forecast.""Corporate performance in the (April-June) quarter pointed to a sharp pick up in profits, though not broad-based. This reflected a cooling-off in input costs, whilst sales growth eased,"" said Radhika Rao , senior economist, DBS group.Economists caution about potential challenges ahead, including the impact of food price spikes and an erratic monsoon on consumption recovery. Retail inflation escalated to 7.4% in July, exceeding the upper limit of RBI's target range (2-6%), and is expected to remain elevated in August.The revival of private investment could act as a growth catalyst, helping India make strides toward becoming the world's third-largest economy, according to Debopam Chaudhuri from Piramal Group.The finance ministry emphasized the continuing role of domestic consumption and investment demand in driving growth. However, it acknowledged persistent uncertainties on the global and domestic fronts, which might contribute to elevated inflation pressures. The ministry's monthly economic report for July emphasized the need for vigilance by both the government and RBI. Economists polled by ET forecast average inflation of 5.5% in FY24, slightly higher than RBI's revised estimate of 5.4%."

Seventy-six years after Independence, India is going places, and so are Indians. Consider this: in 1980, we were the world's 13th largest economy. Today, we are the world's fifth largest. In another four years, we will most likely be the world's third largest. The Indian diaspora is 18 million strong, and arguably one of the most influential globally.Some of the world's biggest companies are now helmed by Indians.You can say this is only the beginning and India's potential is limitless. In 2022, the median age of an Indian was 27.9 years. With the youngest population among major economies, India is best poised to reap its demographic dividend.And to top it all, there are 512 million Indians under the age of 21 - more than the population of any country except China. This young population will make India unstoppable.

Collections in July, for transactions in June, were the third highest monthly mop-up after last April (Rs 1,87,035 crore) and April 2022 (Rs 1,67,540 crore) and marked the fifth time when the kitty was more than Rs 1.6 lakh crore.Domestic transactions saw robust growth with central GST rising 15.6% in July to Rs 29,773 crore and state GST increasing 147% to Rs 37,623 crore. Integrated GST, which is levied on inter-state sales and imports, grew at around 8%, pulled down by 0.4% decline in the levy on shipments coming from abroad. Similarly, the cess on imported and luxury goods fell 15.6% to Rs 840 crore, the lowest since February.There is a clear divergence between revenues on account of domestic transactions (including imports of services) and that on account of imported goods, with the latter averaging at just 0.8% yearon-year during April-July 2023, reflecting the compression in merchandise imports .This divergence is set to continue owing to the expectation of a contraction in merchandise imports in 2023-24,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA. She, however, said that it was realistic to expect collections reaching the annual target of Rs 8.1 lakh crore, for which the monthly mop-up needs to exceed Rs 1,65,000 croreExperts attributed the rising trend to steps taken by the government, both at the Centre and in states. “Consistent growth in GST is a classic case for government investing in core tech infrastructure (with a long-term vision) and refining the system to boost revenues over time. What is heartening is that India is the only country on scale with reducing administrative costs and increasing tax revenues,” said Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder & CEO, DVS Advisors, a tax and business advisory firm."

India’s post-Covid economic recovery has been about investing for the future. It makes the country an outlier

In economic parlance, investment holds a special place in assessing the quality of overall economic growth. At an aggregate level, investment is nothing but spending by economic agents (households, private corporations and government) on creation of capital assets. It can take the form of dwellings, machinery and equipment, and intellectual property products.

In the short run, investment influences gross domestic product (GDP) via the transactional impact of generation of capital assets. More importantly, in the longer run, it boosts the productive capacity of the economy and increases overall efficiency."

India has become the most populous country in the world. How does that change the status of the country on the world scene?

Could you elaborate on what you mean by saying that India is gaining its 'rightful position in the world'?

In your view, what are the pillars of India's soft power?

There was a phenomenal rise in the relationship between India and the US in the last few years. Why is it happening now and what is India's rationale behind this?

Do you consider that India is the natural leader of the 'global south'?

You said many times that the voice of the 'Global South' was not heard in inter-national institutions. What is your plan to increase the South's presence in the international institutions?

You have been advocating for India's permanent membership in the UN security council. Is it the credibility of the UN which is at stake in this perspective?

- Nicolas Barre and Clement Perruche (correspondent in New Delhi)

Before visiting France where he will be the guest of honor of this year's Bastille Day celebrations in Paris on July 14th, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been in power since 2014, received Les Echos at his residence in Delhi, a modern ground-floor building in the middle of a vast tropical garden in the centre of the Indian capital, an oasis of calm in the heart of a bustling city.In this rare interview with a foreign media, the Prime Minister insisted on India's role as a bridge between the Global South and the western world. ""The rights of the Global South have been long denied,"" PM Modi told Les Echos. ""As a result, there is a feeling of anguish among these countries,"" he added. A strong advocate of a comprehensive reshuffle of the Bretton Woods international institutions, PM Modi claimed that India, now the most populous in the world, needs to 'regain its rightful place'. ""This is not just a credibility issue for the UN,"" he emphasized. ""How can the UN Security Council claim to speak for the world when its most populous country, and its largest democracy, is not a permanent member?"" PM Modi asked, adding that President Emmanuel Macron of France, a strategic partner in the Asia-Pacific region, shared his views on the international order.Since 2014, PM Modi introduced major economic reforms with the aim of turning India into ""a developed economy by 2047, the 100th anniversary of our independence"". India is now the world's fifth largest economy and 'on track to become the third largest very soon'.PM Modi expressed caution on the universal appeal of 'western values', saying that 'philosophies from every corner of the world' have to be considered and that ""the world makes quick progress only when it learns to let go of anachronistic and outdated notions"". There is 'one earth' but not 'one philosophy', he stressed. The Prime Minister also touched upon Indian 'soft power', pointing out the global reach of the country's cinema and music, the renewed interest for Ayurveda medicine and, as a practitioner, the universal success of Yoga,'now a household term'.India is a rich civilization that is thousands of years old. Today, India is the most youthful nation in the world. India's strongest asset is our youth. At a time when many countries in the world are ageing and their populations are shrinking, India's young and skilled workforce will be an asset for the world over the decades to come. What is unique is that this workforce is steeped in openness and democratic values, eager to embrace technology, and ready to adapt to the changing world.Even today, Indian diaspora, wherever they are, contribute towards the prosperity of their adopted homeland. The progress of one-sixth of humanity will give the world a more prosperous and sustainable future.As the world's largest democracy, with unparalleled social and economic diversity, our success will demonstrate that democracy delivers. That it is possible for harmony to exist amidst diversity. At the same time, there is a natural expectation of adjustments in the international system and institutions to give the rightful place to the world's largest democracy.I would rather term it as regaining its rightful place. Since time immemorial, India has been at the forefront of contributing to global economic growth, technological advancement and human development. Today, across the world, we see a lot of problems and challenges. Recession, Food security, inflation, social tensions are just some of them. In such a global backdrop, I see a renewed confidence in our people, an optimism about the future, and an eagerness to take its rightful place in the world.Our demographic dividend, our deep roots in democracy, and our civilisational spirit will guide the way as we move towards the future. We recognize our responsibility in contributing to addressing global challenges, building a more cohesive world, giving voice to the aspirations of the weak and advancing global peace and prosperity. India brings its own unique and distinct perspective and voice to the global discourse - and it always stands in favour of peace, a fairer economic order, the concerns of the weaker nations and global cohesion inaddressing our common challenges.India's belief in multilateral action is deep rooted. The International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, the One Sun, One World, One Grid initiative, India's Indo Pacific Oceans Initiatives are all examples of this approach. Or, our supply of Covid vaccines with over 100 countries and sharing our open source digital platform CoWin freely with others. There is a global recognition today that India is a force of good in the world and indispensable for global unity, cohesion, peace and prosperity at a time of great turmoil and risks of fragmentation in the world. As India grows, our contribution towards global good will further increase, and our capabilities and resources will continue to be directed towards the larger good of humanity, not to raise claims against others or challenge the international order.It is our civilizational ethos and heritage that provide the basis what could be termed as India's so! power. We are blessed to have this in abundance. Our exports have never been war and subjugation, but yoga, ayurveda, spirituality, science, mathematics, and Astronomy. We have always been a contributor to global peace and progress.We believe that while we progress and become a modern nation, we should take pride and inspiration from our past and that we can progress only if we do it together with other nations. We are privileged that there is renewed interest in Indian culture and civilization. Yoga is a household term today. Our traditional medicine of Ayurveda is gaining acceptance. Indian cinema, cuisine, music and dance is being sought after across the world.Our coexistence with nature drives our climate actions and drive for sustainable life-styles. Our innate belief in democratic ideals and the success of our vibrant democracy drive our desire to see a more accountable, inclusive, and representative system of international governance, and provide hope and inspiration to many. Our deeply held values of peace, openness, harmony and co-existence; the success of our vibrant democracy; the extraordinary richness of our culture, traditions and philosophy; a consistent voice for the cause of a peaceful, fair and just world ; and, our commitment to international law and peace, are the reasons that India's rise is welcomed, not feared in the world. These are also the pillars of Indian soft power.It is true that the relationship has been growing positively since the turn of the century. It has accelerated and reached new levels in the past nine years. There is widespread support for deepening our ties, from all stakeholders, in both countries - be it government, Parliament, industry, academia and of course the people. The US Congress has consistently extended bipartisan support for elevating our relationship.I have personally enjoyed an excellent rapport with US leadership, across difference administrations, over the last nine years. During my State visit to the United States in June, President Joe Biden and I agreed that the partnership between the world's two largest democracies with exceptionally strong peopleto-people ties could be the defining partnership of this century. This is because this partnership is perfectly placed in terms of interests, vision, commitments and complementarities to address the challenges of our times and contribute in a significant way to shaping the global order.As the challenges to the international order have grown, our partnership is responding with great sense of urgency and purpose. Trust, mutual confidence and belief in the relationship have been key ingredients. Advancing a free, open, inclusive and balanced Indo Pacific region, is a shared goal. We pursue this with other partners in the region and beyond.We are working together to advance standards and norms, build resilient global supply chains, including in critical and emerging technologies, pursue a successful green energy transition, catalyse manufacturing in key sectors, forge a robust defence industrial partnership. We are working together with other countries in the region and beyond and revitalising multilateral institutions. These are all important shared goals that are driving the partnership. There is much that binds our two nations together, and allows us to play a constructive role in addressing the challenges of our times and contributing in a significant way to shaping the global order.I feel that the world leader is quite heavy and India should not arrogate or assume any position. What I really feel, we need is collective strength and collective leadership for the entire Global South, so that its voice can become more strong and the whole community can take leadership for itself. In order to build this sort of collective leadership, I don't think India should think in terms of its position as a leader nor do we think of it in that sense.It is also true that the rights of the Global South have been long denied. As a result, there is a feeling of anguish among the members of Global South, that they are forced into undertaking action but when it comes to decision making they don't find a place or voice for themselves. The true spirit of democracy has not been respected vis-a-vis the Global South. I feel that if we would have worked in the true spirit of democracy and given the same respect, same rights to the Global South as well, the World could have been a more powerful, stronger community. When we can address the concerns of the vast majority that constitute the Global South, we are more likely to restore faith in the international order. We will make our global institutions resilient.Secondly, look at how India thinks of itself in the Global South. I see India being that strong shoulder that if Global South has to make that high jump, India can be that shoulder to propel it ahead. For the Global South, India can also build its linkages with Global North. So, in that sense this shoulder can become this bridge of sorts. So, I feel that what we need is to strengthen this shoulder, this bridge so that linkages between the North and South can become stronger and the Global South can itself become stronger.In January 2023, at the start of our Presidency of the G20, I convened a summit of the Global South. 125 countries participated. There was unanimity of view, expressed very strongly, that India must forcefully take up the causes of the Global South.During our G20 Presidency, under the theme of One Earth, One Family, OneFuture, we have made one of the key goals to be the voice of the Global South. We have tried bring the priorities and interests of the Global South to the centre of the deliberations and decisions of the G20. I have proposed to give the African Union permanent member-ship in the G20.In speaking for the Global South, we are not seeking to position ourselves in any adversarial relationship with the North, so to speak. In fact, this is to advance the vision of One World, One Future. The other alternative is a world that is adrift, that becomes more fragmented, a world of the West vs the Rest, a world in which we yield space to those who do not share our worldview and who seek to establish an alternative order. I think President Macron shares this view. That was the spirit behind his hosting the New Global Financing Pact Summit.The issue is not just of credibility, but something much larger. I believe that the world needs to have an honest discussion about the multilateral governance structures that were built in the a!ermath of second World War.Nearly eight decades after the institutions were created, the world has transformed. The number of member countries have grown by four times. The character of the global economy has changed. We live in an era of newtechnology. New powers have risen causing a relative shift in global balance. We face new challenges, including climate change, cyber security, terrorism, space security, pandemics. I could go on about the changes.In this changed world, many questions arise - are these representative of today's world? Are they able to discharge the roles for which they were set up? Do countries around the world feel that these organizations matter, or are relevant?The UN Security Council, in particular, epitomizes this dissonance. How can we talk of it as a primary organ of a global body, when entire continents of Africa and Latin America are ignored ? How can it claim to speak for the world when its most populous country, and its largest democracy, is not a permanent member? And its skewed member-ship leads to opaque decision making processes, which adds to its helplessness in ad-dressing the challenges of today.I think most countries are clear on what changes they would like to see in the UN Security Council, including on the role India should play. We just need to listen to their voice and heed their advice. I must appreciate the clear and consistent position that France has taken in this matter.We are working with a clear vision for 2047, the 100th anniversary of our independence. We want to see India become a developed country in 2047. A developed economy that caters to the needs of all its people - education, health, infrastructure and opportunities.India will remain a vibrant and participative federal democracy, in which all citizens are secure about their rights, confident of their place in the nation and optimistic about their future.India will be a global leader in innovation and technology. A nation with sustainable lifestyles, clean rivers, blue skies and forests brimming with biodiversity and alive with wildlife. Our economy will be a hub of opportunities, an engine for global growth and its source of skills and talent. India will be a strong testimony to the power of democracy. We will help advance a more balanced multipolar world, anchored in international law and underpinned by the discipline of multilateralism.I feel that when we look at where the world is today, the thought processes from every corner of the world, the efforts from every corner of the world, the philosophies from every corner of the world have had their relevance in their time period and have together brought us where the world is today. But the world makes quick progress only when it learns to let go of anachronistic and outdated notions. The more we let go of outdated notions, the more we can adopt new things.So, I don't look in terms of whether West or East is better, whether one thought process is better than the other. Our Vedas, written thousands of years ago, spoke of letting all noble thoughts come from all sides. We don't close ourselves off. Whatever is good in the world, we should have the ability to appreciate, accept and adopt it. Which is why if you look at our G20 theme of Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam, One earth, One family, One future, but we have not said one philosophy.Our economic development has always been guided by a people centric approach. We have tried to implement decisions that take along the most disadvantaged. Our focus on last mile connectivity, on reaching out to every household, has been extremely successful. Harnessing digital technology has been a key element in this.We have promoted an unprecedented level of social and economic inclusion and empowerment. So far, we have built more than 40 million homes for the poor and 110 million toilets for proper sanitation. We have opened bank accounts for around 500 million people & provided 400 million microcredit loans. We have provided cooking gas connection to 90 million households and 500 million people get free health insurance coverage.Use of digital technology and India's revolution in digital public infrastructure has brought universal banking to India. It has helped to disburse over Euro 300 billion in direct benefits to people, provide a measure of free food to 800 million people since the onset of Covid. Today, 46 % of real time digital payments globally happen in India.Since 2014, we have implemented economic reforms that aim to unlock the potential of each individual. We have focussed on ease of doing business, and to encourage the entrepreneurial streak in every Indian. We have promoted innovation and Start Ups. In-dia is now the world's third largest start up ecosystem.We are ensuring a predictable, transparent and stable policy regime to help investors. We have focussed on technology and education, which are the cornerstones of long-term growth and development. We aim to become a world leader in technology, to make India a leading player in AI, quantum computing, semiconductors, space, defence.We are also paying enormous attention to infrastructure development. The speed and scale of change, be it roads, railways, airports, ports, pipelines or power stations is un-precedented. The Gati-Shakti programme is bringing down the cost of logistics and facilitating planned development. Initiatives like Production Linked Incentive Scheme and the National Infrastructure Pipeline project have given a massive boost to manufacturing in India. Our economy is now the world's fi!h largest and on track to become the third largest very soon.Engagement with the world is an important part of our economic strategy. Our vision of Make in India does not aim to close India away from the world. We are also the only G20 country that reached Paris commitments on climate nine years ahead of 2030. We are committed to build India into a developed economy by 2047.Our interests in the Indo-Pacific region are vast, and our engagement is deep. I have described our vision for this region in one word - SAGAR, which stands for Security and Growth for All in the Region. While peace is necessary for the future we seek to build, it is far from assured.India has always stood for peaceful resolution of differences through dialogue and diplomacy, and for respecting sovereignty of all nations, international law and the rules-based international order. This is more important than ever for maintaining mutual trust and confidence. We believe that it is through this that a positive contribution can be made towards lasting regional and global peace and stability.India and France have a broad-based and comprehensive strategic partnership that encompasses political, defence, security, economic, human-centric development and sustainability cooperation. When countries with similar vision and values work together, bilaterally, in plurilateral arrangements or in regional institutions, they can deal with any challenge. Our partnership, including in the Indo Pacific region, is not directed against, or at the expense of any country. Our aim is to safeguard our economic and security interests, ensure freedom of navigation and commerce, advance the rule of international law in the region.We work with other countries to develop their capabilities and support their efforts to make free sovereign choices. More broadly, we aim to advance peace and stability in the region.I have spoken a number of times to President Putin and President Zelenskyy. I met President Zelenskyy in Hiroshima. Recently, I spoke to President Putin again. India's stand has been clear, transparent and consistent. I have said that it is not an era of war. We have urged both sides to resolve issues through dialogue and diplomacy. I told them that India is ready to support all genuine efforts that can help bring this conflict to an end.First of all, on behalf of 1.4 billion Indians, I wish to convey my heartfelt gratitude to France, to its government and personally to President Macron for inviting India to 14th July National day celebrations as Guest of honour. I feel grateful to visit France on this occasion. This is a special year as it marks the 25th anniversary of our strategic partnership. It is an honour for India and a tribute toIndia-France friendship.As far as 25 years of the strategic partnership is concerned, I feel we are now at a turn-ing point. If we look at the post pandemic global order and the shape that it is taking, I think the positive experience of our strategic partnership is an important step ahead. So, we look forward to working on a roadmap for the next 25 years of the strategic partnership, which I think is very important for the relationship.The relationship is in excellent shape. It is strong, trusted, consistent. It has been steady and resilient in the darkest storms. It has been bold and ambitious in looking for opportunities.The level of mutual trust and confidence we share is unmatched. It stems from shared values and vision. We share a strong sense of strategic autonomy. Both have deep commitment to international law. We both seek a multipolar world. Both of us carry an unwavering faith in multilateralism.Our partnership in sensitive areas like space and defence go back to five decades and more. It was a phase when the West did not have a friendly disposition towards India. So, it is not a surprise that France was the first Western country with which we declared a Strategic Partnership. That was a difficult time for the world, including for In-dia. Since then our relationship has transformed into a partnership that is important not just for our two countries, but is of great geopolitical consequence.Since coming to office in 2014, I have placed special emphasis on our Strategic Partner-ship with France. I made my first visit to France in April 2015, within a year of entering office. I greatly respect the manner in which the people of France honour the service of the 140,000 Indian soldiers who fought in the 1st World War in defence of liberty and peace in France. It is moving to see the manner in which the memories of 9000 Indian are kept alive in 163 cemeteries in France. I had the chance to visit the cemetery in Neuve-Chapelle in 2015. I have worked closely with French leadership, especially since President Macron was elected, to develop this partnership, not just in the bilateral framework, but for the global good.We believe that all countries have an obligation to respect the respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries, to abide by international law and adhere to the UN Charter.We are also deeply concerned about the impact of the conflict on the wider world, especially the Global South. Countries already suffering from the impact of the Covid pandemic now face energy, food and health crisis, economic slowdown, inflation and rising debt burden. The conflict must end. We must also address the challenges that countries of the South are facing.Our partnership is deepening in economic, social, cultural and people to people contacts between the two countries. Our trade has nearly doubled since 2014. Just this year, two Indian air carriers have placed order for more than 750 aircra! on Airbus. Both countries are working more closely to realize the vision of using digital public infrastructure for public good. There is strong collaboration in clean energy, including solar, wind and clean hydrogen.President Macron has taken many initiatives to deepen our co-operation. Last year, India was the country of the year in Paris Book Fair, Cannes Film Festival, VivaTech, Paris Infra Week and International Seatech Week in France in 2022. Defence cooperation has progressed rapidly. We have started a genuine industrial partnership, including on co-design and co-development, not just for ourselves but also for other countries.We cooperate and coordinate much more closely in international forums. We together launched the International Solar Alliance. We are now working together on initiatives on biodiversity, elimination of single use plastic, disaster resilient infrastructure and conserving ocean resources.Our cooperation has become especially strong in the United Nations, whether it is in reforming the UN institutions, fighting climate change or combating terrorism. Most recently, we worked closely on President Macron's New Global Financing Pact Summit. We are both leaders in the initiative on No Money for Terror Financing.I feel that President Macron's thinking really matches ours. And so we are naturally compatible to work together. And for this, I have the greatest gratitude towards him. Our partnership is vital for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. We see France as one of our foremost global partners.As I have said, India-France strategic partnership is one of the key partnerships in influencing the course of the Indo Pacific region. We are the two major resident powers in the Indian Ocean region.Our partnership aims to advance a free, open, inclusive, secure and stable Indo-Pacific region, working together and with others in the region who share our vision. There is a strong defence and security component that extends from seabed to space. It also seeks to help other countries in the region and strengthen the regional institutions for security cooperation and norm setting.We are working together not just to strengthen India's defence industrial base and our joint operational capabilities. We will also collaborate to support the security needs of other countries, including on defence equipment. But, it goes beyond that. It involves the full range of economic, connectivity, human development and sustainability initiatives. These will draw other countries into shared endeavours of prosperity and peace. This partnership opens great possibilities for regional cooperation. Further, beyond the Indian Ocean Region, we will increasingly coordinate and cooperate in the Pacific Region, as well. Our partnership will also include the EU, which has its own Indo Pacific strategy. With EU, we already have an EU-India Connectivity Partnership."

India's April-June quarter GDP grows at 7.8%, country remains fastest growing large economy

NEW DELHI: India's Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) grew 7.8 per cent in the April-June quarter of FY 24, compared to 13.1% growth rate witnessed in Q1 of FY 2022-23, data released by government showed.The Central government's NSO office on Thursday released the GDP figures for the first quarter of the new financial year.India remained the fastest-growing major economy as China's GDP growth in the April-June quarter was 6.3 per cent.The South Asian nation overtook Britain last year to become the world's fifth-largest economy, and recently surpassed China to become the most populous country.Its growth has rebounded since the Covid-19 pandemic - up 7.2 percent for the year to March - and has remained near the top of the pack among the world's biggest economies.Thursday's figure was the highest in four quarters, with official statistics showing on-year growth of 12.2 percent for the financial, real estate and professional services sectors.As per the NSO data, the agriculture sector recorded a 3.5 per cent growth, up from 2.4 per cent in the April-June quarter of 2022-23.However, the growth in the manufacturing sector decelerated to 4.7 per cent in the first quarter of the current fiscal compared to 6.1 per cent in the year-ago period.The nominal GDP or GDP at current prices in Q1 2023-24 is estimated at Rs 70.67 lakh crore, as against Rs 65.42 lakh crore in Q1 2022-23, showing a growth of 8 percent as compared to 27.7 percent in Q1 2022-23, data showed.The growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during the January-March quarter of 2022-23 was 6.1 per cent and 4.5 per cent in October-December.The rise in Q1 GDP numbers come amid strong demand, robust service sector growth and increased government expenditure.The figures have beaten certain estimates that had pegged the growth at 7.7% in the June quarter.Meanwhile, the growth of eight key infrastructure sectors rose to 8 per cent in July 2023 compared to 4.8 per cent in the same month last year on expansion in production of coal, crude oil, and natural gas, according to the official data released on Thursday.Addressing media after the release of the GDP numbers, CEA V Anantha Nageswaran said that the figures are in line with expectations.On rising inflation due to recent spike in vegetable prices, the CEA that it is no cause of concern as the government as well as RBI are taking measures to maintain adequate supply.""Food inflation is likely to subside with arrival of fresh stock and govt measures ... impact of deficient rains in August will be watched,"" he said.""There is momentum in economic activity in general and it is not driven by price-related distortions. Therefore our projections still are very comfortably placed at 6.5 per cent for the current financial year,"" he said.Risk is evenly distributed to around 6.5 per cent growth projection for FY2023-24, he said.Rising crude prices may warrant attention and prolonged geopolitical uncertainty and likely tighter financial conditions can pose risk to growth, he added.The CEA also said that at the moment, there is no threat to the 5.9% fiscal deficit target announced in Union Budget 2023-24.India’s economy shined in its latest report card primarily on strong services growth and a modest pick up in manufacturing despite still-high interest rates, Bloomberg reported.“The data shows today that domestic factors, especially services, remain in the driver’s seat as far as economic activity is concerned for India,” said Rahul Bajoria, an economist with Barclays Plc.Companies in the information technology, hotels and transport industries are expanding and could bring more business to the the services sector, which contributes to more than half of GDP. Double-digit credit growth in the financial services sector is also helping.However, slowing exports weighed on manufacturing growth despite easing supply chain bottlenecks and global commodity prices.

Sales were unchanged month-on-month, the data showed.Petrol and diesel sales have been on the rise since the second half of March on the back of a pick-up in industrial and agriculture activity. But the arrival of monsoon has cooled temperatures and reduced demand for running diesel gensets to irrigate fields and cut down consumption in tractors and trucks in the first half of June.Petrol consumption during June was 33.5 per cent more than COVID-marred June 2021 and 20.6 per cent more than pre-pandemic June 2019.Diesel consumption was up 30 per cent over June 2021 and 6.5 per cent higher than in June 2019.With the aviation sector booming with summer travellers, jet fuel (ATF) demand soared 6 per cent to 587,300 tonne in June compared to the same period last year. It was 140 per cent higher than in June 2021 but 4.6 per cent lower than pre-Covid June 2019.Month-on-month sales fell 2.4 per cent against 6,02,000 tonnes in May 2023.The Indian economy has gained pace with a pick-up in government and private capital spending. Manufacturing too has picked up, while the services sector has been robust.The country's oil demand during the last few months was supported by strong industrial activity, industry officials said.Cooking gas LPG sales were down 0.8 per cent year-on-year to 2.27 million tonnes in June.

Russian President Putin hails PM Modi's 'Make in India' initiative

NEW DELHI: During a forum organized by Russia's Agency for Strategic Initiatives (ASI) in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin praised India for its efforts in promoting local development, manufacturing, and assembly of products. He specifically highlighted the success of India's ' Make in India ' initiative, which was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.“Our friends in India and our big friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, launched the ‘Make in India’ initiative several years ago. It has had a truly impressive effect on the Indian economy . It would do no harm to emulate what is working well, even if it was not us but our friends who created it,” the Russian president said.Recognizing India as a valuable example, Putin suggested that other countries should consider implementing similar strategies. Putin drew attention to the opportunities available to Russian companies in light of Western sanctions policies and stressed the importance of providing support to help these companies market their products more effectively.India has emerged as a key buyers of Russian oil in the wake of western sanctions imposed on Moscow since the invasion of Ukraine . According to data from analytics firm Kpler, Russia accounted for 46% of India’s oil imports last month, a staggering leap from less than 2% before the invasion of Ukraine.Putin credited Indian leadership for creating a successful model that encourages local manufacturing capabilities and attracts foreign investors. Furthermore, Putin emphasized the significance of enhancing product design and functionality to boost domestic business development.The 'Make in India' initiative, which spans 25 sectors such as automobiles, textiles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and renewable energy, was launched in 2014 by the Modi-led government. It has played a crucial role in positioning the Indian economy as a global manufacturing powerhouse. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion people and the fifth-largest GDP of approximately $3.7 trillion, India has become an attractive destination for both license manufacturing by global companies and foreign investment due to its vast consumer market.Recently, Russian ambassador Denis Alipov in New Delhi has said that the ""special Russia-India strategic partnership"" has shown strength and is ""growing stronger as ever''.""There have been lies about Russia on a daily basis and on a global scale. Efforts are being made to disrupt Russia - India relations,"" Envoy Alipov said during the state reception hosted in the national capital that was dedicated to the National Day of the Russian Federation."

As forecasts from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration of the US and the World Meteorological Organisation signal the arrival of El Nino, it’s clear that India faces more than mere climatic changes. This weather phenomenon, infamous for its ability to warm the climate and disrupt weather patterns, could significantly affect India’s political landscape.

El Nino has had a significant impact on the economic and political history of India. In fact, the overlap between El Nino years and the social and political development in the country is astounding and uncannily consistent."

A roaring rally in mid- and small-cap stocks listed on Indian bourses could see abrupt corrections, as many of them trade at near or record highs even though overall consumption demand remains sluggish, at least six analysts said.The Nifty mid-cap 100 index has hit fresh all-time highs in each of the previous seven sessions, gaining 19% so far in fiscal year 2024, while the small-cap index touched new 52-week highs over the last seven sessions and added 20% year to date.In contrast, the benchmark BSE sensex and the NSE Nifty have gained 7.7% and 8.6% in the same period, respectively.""The sharp rally in mid and small caps seem to be bordering on euphoria as consumption demand remains sluggish and valuations have reached unrealistic levels in most cases,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote on Monday.Growth in the Indian economy is seen slowing to 6.5% in the current financial year compared to 7.2% last year. In the Jan-March quarter - the latest data available - private consumption grew just 2.8% even as government spending boosted the broader economy. Weaker demand could weigh on company earnings.Others warned of erratic monsoons, which can impact India's largely agriculture-based economy.""Nothing is cheap right now, so investors have to be very, very selective on midcaps,"" said Avinash Gorakshakar, head - research at Profitmart Securities. ""If monsoon is not as per expectations, we could witness a temporary halt in the rally.""The 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio - a metric that measures valuation of an index or security - of the mid-cap index stood at 24.1 on June 20, while the Nifty 50's P/E ratio was 21.9. The P/E ratio for the small-cap index was just below at 19.6.The P/E ratio of midcap index has risen from 23.5 at the start of the year to 24.02 in June while the P/E ratio of smallcap index rose from 16.39 in January to 19.6, amid the rally in markets.Most mid-cap stocks are also trading well above their pre-Covid multiples.A strong inflow of funds from domestic investors has been instrumental in pushing up valuations.Since January 2022, mid-cap equity-oriented schemes and small-cap schemes saw inflows of 286 billion rupees ($3.49 billion) and 318.91 billion rupees respectively, twice as much as the 143.45 billion rupees invested into large-cap schemes, data from the Association for Mutual Funds in India showed.The interest in this set of stocks has prompted fund house Motilal Oswal to launch India's first-ever micro-cap index fund for investors looking beyond the Nifty 500 firms for hidden opportunities.""Large caps can absorb that much of liquidity, but when midcaps start attracting that kind of flow, then it becomes difficult to absorb liquidity and valuations will get re-rated,"" said Hemant Kanawala, head - equity investments, Kotak Life Insurance. One 97 Communications, Aurobindo Pharma, PB Fintech have been among the top mid-cap performers in 2023, adding over 40%.To be sure, not everyone is skeptical about the recent rally.""Post the correction in global equities in 2022, the rally in Indian markets has been more broad-based and has trickled down to midcaps,"" said Atul Suri, chief executive officer at Marathon Trends Advisory.Suri expects the rally in broader markets to continue, led by the revival in the industrial cycle. He identified inflation as the major lingering risk to the Indian market rally."

We are hopeful for a rating upgrade from Moody's,"" an official said after the meeting.Moody's Investors Service has a 'Baa3' sovereign credit rating on India, with a stable outlook. 'Baa3' is the lowest investment grade rating.Apart from highlighting India's ongoing economic reforms, government thrust on infrastructure development and forex reserves nearing USD 600 billion, government officials also questioned Moody's on its rating parameters.Officials from all economy-related ministries and Niti Aayog attended the meeting.India has long been questioning the methodology adopted by international agencies while according credit rating and has nudged them to become more transparent and less subjective.It has been pitching for amendment in sovereign credit ratings methodology saying it should reflect economies' ability and willingness to pay their debt obligations.Moody's representatives discussed the government's disinvestment roadmap and officials highlighted that disinvestment should be seen from the prism of reform and not just revenue generation exercise.In June 2020, Moody's downgraded India's rating to 'Baa3' from 'Baa2' with a negative outlook, citing weak reform push and slow growth. In October 2021, the outlook on the rating was revised to stable.The government had largely met its fiscal objectives over the past two years. The fiscal deficit, which is the difference between government expenditure and revenue, narrowed to 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2022-23 fiscal, from 6.7 per cent of GDP in 2021-22 fiscal.In the current fiscal, the deficit is budgeted at 5.9 per cent of GDP.As per the fiscal consolidation roadmap, the government intends to bring down the fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent of GDP by 2025-26.Last month, two other global rating agencies S&P and Fitch had kept India's rating unchanged at 'BBB-', with a stable outlook.All three global rating agencies — Fitch, S&P and Moody's — have the lowest investment grade rating on India, with a stable outlook.

Now, they have to postpone it to 2024. So, to that extent it will have some impact on the financial markets in the US, which can then spill over into the global markets.” He, however, added, “I don’t think it is a big factor for us to worry about.”However, the US markets remaining buoyant makes it a risk factor since the markets were not corrected, despite increase in basis points. “The markets did not correct in the past two years in spite of a rate increase by 500 basis points. We haven’t had a proper bad market for quite a while. So, that remains a risk factor for the world economy. But, with respect to the capital market, nobody can say when it materialises,” Nageswaran said.To a query on dip in merchandise and non-oil exports in April FY24 over the corresponding month in FY23, he said, export growth is dependent on the growth rate in the rest of the world. “If the growth rate goes down in the rest of the world, naturally the exports will be affected. The fact is that in FY22, we had a good pick up in merchandise exports. FY22-23 had a base year challenge to overcome. Maybe in 23-24, the base year challenge may not be so high. There could still be a modest growth in merchandise exports.”Earlier, delivering his address at a FICCI event on ‘Indian Economy @100 – Journey to the Amrit Kaal’, he said, the agriculture sector looks to be in good health. “There are concerns about El Nino. Most drought years are El Nino years, but not all El Nino years become drought years.

Of this, about 800 MSMEs are located in Tamil Nadu.Nandini, deputy chairperson, CII southern region & managing director, Chandra Textiles Pvt Ltd said, “We will work closely with the state government to transform Tamil Nadu into a media, entertainment and animation hub of India. We will come up with vision documents for six districts to promote industrial development and job creation in the state.” CII will also promote Chennai as the fintech capital of India and the city as a global hub for Global Capability Centres (GCC), she added."

Recent critiques of ‘excessive economic power’ of Indian conglomerates by Nouriel Roubini, Viral Acharya aren’t supported by either global comparisons or data

Has India’s economic policymaking, especially on the industrial-manufacturing front, veered sharply towards creation of a few National Champion (NC) businesses, spanning infrastructure, manufacturing and even services?

The hypothesis has gone beyond gossipy speculation, with Nouriel Roubini (famously credited for “predicting” the Global Financial crisis in 2008) talking about it. More recently, Viral Acharya (former deputy governor, Reserve Bank of India) blamed the market power of “5 conglomerates” (the names usually identified as putative NCs) for high inflation in India. Is it the dawn of Indian chaebols with disproportionate market influence?"

Didn’t these symbols connect us with our core values despite being a newly-created nation? The problem is people speak of modernity without understanding Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj, which tells us to understand the values at India’s core. Those who haven’t read it oppose everything,” Yadav said.The senior BJP leader further said Congress’s boycott of the inauguration of Parliament was not only an insult to the country but also to the Constitution, which the party claims to swear by.“I feel sorry for a party that boycotts an institution that represents the Constitution of India. Congress protested when we implemented GST. It protested when India began Covid vaccination and when we opened Jan Dhan bank accounts. All they want is that one family should be in power. But the country is not for one family alone, but for the entire country,” Yadav said.Asserting that recent GDP and Periodic Labour Force Survey data belied Rahul’s claims about a “falling” Indian economy , Yadav underlined that while India saw robust GDP growth of 7.2%, PLFS and EPFO registration numbers have shown an improvement on the employment front.He added that unemployment declined to 6.8%, the lowest in four years, the labour force participation rose from 48.2% to 48.5% in the last quarter in 2023, and women showed greater enthusiasm for work in the quarter ending March 2023. He also said the ministry undertook several initiatives, from E-shram registrations of nearly 30 crore unorganised workers, creating linkages with the National Service Portal, and tying up with Microsoft to run the DigiSaksham initiative, to upskill the Indian workforce with the knowledge of AI.Yadav denied the charge that employment realities were different from government data, and that Congress was able to wrest Karnataka from BJP on the back of its unemployment dole to the youth and would repeat the model in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Yadav said the Modi government was “on the right path” and had the popular backing of people.He also exuded confidence that the government would win the 2024 Lok Sabha polls on the basis of the government’s nine-year development track record and rubbished the opposition’s “politics of allurement”."

The Opposition party also said the government should mark this day as ""Maafi Diwas"".Hitting back on the issue of national security, BJP leader Prasad said India's land was grabbed by the Chinese when the Congress was in power while the country showed its mettle in eastern Ladakh during clashes with the army of the neighbouring country.While the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has boosted border infrastructure, the Congress deliberately kept it in poor shape, he claimed.Prasad also attacked Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, accusing him of lowering the discourse with his choice of language in attacking Modi.""They should rise above their hatred for Modi. The Congress was badly defeated the last two times and will suffer a similar fate in 2024,"" he said.The BJP leader also described the Congress' charge of ""Covid mismanagement"" against the government as the ""height of shamelessness"" and claimed the whole world has recognised India's handling of the pandemic as the ""best"".Oxygen express trains were run, health infrastructure augmented and the entire country was administered vaccines, he said, adding derisively that Congress leaders too were inoculated.Do criticise the government but why weaken the country's resolve, Prasad asked and termed the Congress' critique a big insult to health workers and others engaged in saving the country during the pandemic.The size of India's economy was $1 trillion in 2014 when the BJP government was sworn in and it is now nearly USD 3.5 trillion, he said, adding that the country's forex reserve is over Rs 50 lakh crore (Indian valuation) while export has almost doubled to Rs 36 lakh crore.Countering the Congress' criticism of the government on the issue of price rise, the BJP leader said retail inflation is now at 4.7 per cent while whole inflation was in the negative. He also noted that inflation in the US was 8.9 per cent, in France 17.5 per cent and in Germany 23.5 per cent.In the manufacturing sector, Prasad said that India now meets 99 per cent of its mobile phone needs while it used to import 78 per cent of its demand in 2014.The Modi government has significantly hiked MSP prices of farm produce, he said, adding that over 11 crore farmers are now being given Rs 6,000 annually.The country recorded its highest-ever GST total of Rs 1.87 lakh crore in April while Rs 6.68 lakh crore was transferred to beneficiaries of 312 schemes under direct benefit transfer, saving over Rs 2.7 lakh crore which used to be pocketed by middlemen earlier, he said.With the economy growing, the infrastructure sector is witnessing a huge bump with the number of airports doubling and highways being constructed like never before. Employment has also received a boost, Prasad said.""The questions asked by the Congress are a bundle of lies and mountain of deception. These nine questions are not arising out of any criticism which is their right but out of pathological hatred for Narendra Modi,"" Prasad said.Mocking the Congress, he said it was shocking for the opposition party to ask questions on corruption as the UPA's 10 years in power between 2004-14 was marked by graft in every sector covering land, air and water.""The opposition party is marked by four Cs of cut, commission, corruption and the Congress,"" Prasad said.The Congress should know that Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi, both former party presidents, are out on bail in the alleged corruption in the National Herald case, he added."

He met various Union ministers and company executives, among others.""I think that nations in the developing world have something to learn from India. India is the largest democracy in the world and it is also an open society with entrepreneurs and innovators and free speech,"" he said.Further, Brende highlighted that India has more of a broad ecosystem of startups than in any other developing country and that is growing. This is something that other countries can also be inspired by, he added.Geneva-headquartered WEF is an international organisation for public private cooperation, and is known for its annual Davos meeting, often described as the biggest congregation of the global elite.The Forum engages the foremost political, business, cultural and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas.This year, WEF expects almost 6 per cent economic growth for India and will be the highest growth for any big economies of the world, he said.""We, at WEF, see the growth path forward for India that is also strong... Overall, I am optimistic, provided there are no external factors that will influence negatively.

Investing more in infrastructure, connecting different regions even better and India needs more investment in education, upskilling, reskilling and right skilling in the years to come,"" he said.Brende, also a former Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Industry, highlighted that during the coronavirus pandemic, India did something very right.""Some countries overspent on stimulus, that there is no ammunition left.

While higher borrowing costs might have slowed some activity, India remains the world’s fastest-growing major economy, outpacing China and drawing foreign inflows into the equity markets.“In the economic survey we said 6.5% is our baseline with the downside risks more than the upside risks and we maintained it in the April monthly economic report,” said Nageswaran, who advises finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , and is the lead author of the government’s annual economic report card.“Now I am incrementally, slightly more inclined to move to the neutral range, in saying risks to this number are evenly balanced in the kind of position I am willing to take,” he added.So barring the monsoon and geo-political risks, India’s economy is on a “steady auto-pilot” and “ticks all the right boxes at this point,” Nageswaran said.High frequency indicators compiled by Bloomberg showed India’s economy gaining momentum in April thanks to higher tax collections and a booming services sector. However, exports and imports declined, smudging the outlook for Asia’s third-largest economy.For Nageswaran, the data is positive overall. Trade is “not singing a different tune” as goods exports are falling on slowing global demand and the decline in imports is due to lower crude oil prices, he said.The stable current account deficit and rising foreign exchange reserves are all giving positive signs, he added.Inflation has slowed to an 18-month low of 4.7%, but a hot summer, which could impact crops, is fueling concerns. Other inflation risks could come from volatile global commodity prices as India is a major importer of crude and edible oils.Nageswaran said he is “confident about the inflation trajectory” and sees it slowing further to 4% by next year if crude prices stay low."

NEW DELHI: India’s economic activity picked up pace in April on record tax collections and a booming services sector though rising unemployment and weaker trade metrics could sap some sentiment.The needle on a dial measuring the so-called Animal Spirits swung to six after staying at five for three consecutive months, signaling some strengthening in Asia’s third-largest economy.While six of the eight high-frequency indicators compiled by Bloomberg showed an improvement, a slowdown in India’s key export markets and high jobless rate may cloud prospects.The reading comes ahead of the Reserve Bank of India ’s monetary policy decision due June 8, where it is likely to stay on hold as central bankers assess the impact of past year’s rate hikes on growth and inflation.Positive economic indicators would give comfort to the rate setters that an aggressive tightening hasn’t choked up the economy, allowing borrowing costs to remain elevated for longer to keep inflation within the target range of 2%-6%. Retail inflation slowed to an 18-month low of 4.70% in April.Here are more details from the animal spirits barometer, which uses a three-month weighted average to smooth out volatility in single-month readings:Purchasing managers’ surveys showed manufacturing activity improving as raw material costs moderated, leading to “unprecedented increase in input stocks as manufacturers seek to fulfill demand,” according to S&P Global Inc. Services activity and new business rose at fastest pace since June 2010, pushing up the composite index to a new high of 61.60.Stronger demand conditions allowed businesses to pass on rising costs to customers and to pay higher wages to staff though the labor market remained weak.“Despite the substantial pick-up in sales growth and improved business sentiment toward the outlook, the increase in employment seen in April was negligible and failed to gain meaningful traction,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.India’s trade outlook is dimming both at home and abroad. Exports dropped 12.7% in April, while imports declined 14.06% from a year ago, narrowing the trade gap to near two-year low. Demand for Indian goods in the US and Europe is “not looking good” and it may stay the same for the next two to three months, Director General of Foreign Trade Santosh Kumar Sarangi said last week.In contrast, the services sector saw outbound shipments rising for a second month, aided by a surge in information technology and business consulting work for India, known as the back office of the world.Market share gains helped to propel India’s services exports to $33 billion and it “would still stay stable at a high level even if global services do not grow from here,” Morgan Stanley economists led by Chetan Ahya said in a research note May 17.Liquidity in the banking system tightened in April, pushing up overnight rates and making it difficult for firms with a weaker credit profile to access funds from the markets. However, overall bank credit still increased from a month ago as companies borrowed to expand operations and meet domestic demand.Banking system liquidity is set to improve in the coming weeks after the central bank removed the highest valued bank notes from circulation, which may spur more deposits.India’s goods and services tax collection, which helps measure consumption, hit a record high of 1.87 trillion rupees ($22.6 billion) in April after rising 12% from a year ago. In a sign that the growth in consumer demand is uneven, new vehicle retail sales fell 1.4% in the same period, according to data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations.Electricity consumption, a widely used proxy to measure demand in industrial and manufacturing sectors, rose from the previous month with the onset of the summer season. Peak demand at the end of April rose to 178 gigawatt from 170 gigawatt a month ago.India’s unemployment rate climbed to four-month high of 8.11%, from 7.80% in March as job creation failed to keep pace with a rapidly growing workforce in the world’s most populous country."

""The upward trends seen in rural markets is particularly encouraging, and may be the turning point for the industry.""However, NielsenIQ said consumers have not fully returned to buying bigger packs, as consumers living paycheck to paycheck are increasingly buying smaller packs of consumer goods to save cash.Consumption in urban areas was steady, rising 5.3% in the first three months of the year, bringing the overall volume growth to 3.1% for the period.That, along with the price hikes and a demand rebound in mom-and-pop stores, helped boost the overall value of sales by 10.2% in the first quarter.NielsenIQ expects the value of sales to rise 7%-9% for the whole of 2023, higher than the 8.4% increase in 2022, benefiting from likely timely monsoon as well as the central bank's expectations for the Indian economy to expand.Consumer goods makers have, so far, reported mixed earnings for the March quarter: toothpaste maker Dabur India posted shrinking margins, while Pepsi-bottler Varun Beverages recorded profit growth.Meanwhile, a Reuters poll of economists found India's consumer inflation likely cooled to an 18-month low in April as fuel prices moderated, potentially setting up consumer goods makers for sales gains in the April-June quarter."

They want to make Karnataka the number one ATM for its royal family in Delhi. The Congress, which is eating 85% commission in each scheme, will take Karnataka’s development in reverse gear.”Addressing party workers at an election campaign at Kolnad in Mulki on Wednesday, Modi said that people of Karnataka should be careful about the Congress and JD(S).“The ‘sankalp’ (committment) of BJP is to make Karnataka number one, and develop modern infrastructure, and make the state a manufacturing superpower. This is the roadmap for the coming years, but the Congress wants your vote because one of their leader’s is retiring,” he said.Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts are known for toppers in education, the PM said and stressed on: “Ee bariya nirdhara bahumathada BJP sarkara” (this time there will be a majority BJP government).“The double-engine government has brought schemes for the empowerment of women. The public is aware of the G-20, whose main agenda is women-led development. The BJP created a separate ministry for fishermen. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana and Matsya Siri Yojana of the state government were introduced for the benefit of fishermen. We are committed to the welfare of fishermen and their families. Till 2014, inland fisheries and aquaculture production was 60 lakh tonnes. In the past 9 years, the production has increased to more than 120 lakh tonnes,” he said.On the startup revolution in Karnataka, Modi said that the doors of the space sector have been opened to private players.“The youth of Karnataka have been making rockets and satellites. HAL has recorded the highest profit, which was possible because the BJP works honestly for the nation. A wave of innovation will be created in the nation,” he said.“The Indian economy has attained the fifth place in the world. We have overtaken England to reach the fifth place. We want to reach the third place, for which I need the support of the people of Karnataka, without which I cannot go forward. Hence, the May 10 election will decide the future,” he said.BJP Dakshina Kannada district president Sudarshan Moodbidri gifted a Ganesha idol to the Prime Minister, while Udupi district BJP president Kuilady Suresh Nayak gifted an idol of Udupi Krishna."

Yet, India will continue to be the fastest-growing economy in the world.Replying to a question on Reserve Bank of India's flexible inflation targeting, Virmani said, ""We should be more like the US Federal Reserve, which has an inflation target but also takes account of GDP,"" he said.The government has mandated the central bank to ensure that retail inflation based on the consumer price index (CPI) remains at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side.The central bank, which effected six back-to-back hikes in the key short-term lending rate (repo) since May 2022 to check high inflation, decided to take a pause early this month. The cumulative rate hike since May 2022 is 250 basis points.Asked whether India can replicate the economic success that has made China central to the world economy and global power, Virmani said that he does not think any other country now will be allowed to follow unfair trade policies which China had followed.""And my estimate is that roughly 1/3 of China's growth would not have happened, if it did not have these unfair trade policies,"" he said.Virmani pointed out that India doesn't follow an asymmetric policy and it can grow at 6.5-7 per cent without following unfair trade policies."

It is well below the threshold of conflict, but possibility of a full-fledged war cannot be ruled out, the Navy chief said.On a question on PLA Navy ships docking at ports in Pakistan, he said, these ships are docking at ports in various countries, and not just in Pakistan.As far as their visit to ports in Pakistan are concerned, ""we are seized of it, and keep a watch on it"", he said.Admiral Kumar said the Pakistan Navy is modernising itself at a ""good pace"" and seeks to become a 50-platform force in 10-15 years, and they are adding new corvettes and frigates to their fleet.As far as China is concerned, in the last 10 years, a large number of ships and submarines have been commissioned by it, the third aircraft carrier is under construction, and much larger destroyers they are working on, he said, adding, ""we feel this will plateau at some time"".""We are keeping a very close watch in the Indian Ocean Region... and effort is to know whose presence is there and what are they up to, and monitoring it 24x7, and we deploy aircraft, UAVs, ships, submarines, etc.,"" the Navy chief said.""There is a large presence of Chinese vessels. At any point of time, there are 3-6 Chinese warships in the India Ocean Region,"" he said, adding some are close to the Gulf of Oman, and some in the eastern part of the IOR, among other places.Chinese research vessels are ever present, numbering from 2-4 and Chinese fishing vessels as well. So, there is a large presence of Chinese vessels in the Indian Ocean Region, and India Navy keeps track of it, the Navy chief said.""So, we refine our plans, actions that are required to be taken, and this also feeds into our capability development,"" the Navy chief said.Later, in response to a query from audience on Chinese research vessels, Admiral Kumar said, these vessels have the ability to track and collect electronic signals.When they operate, close to ""our areas of national interest"", the Indian Navy keeps an eye, and it has its ships which ""monitor them very, very closely"".On a question on whether modernisation and capability development has any link with threat assessment, he said, modernisation is part of the process and not threat-driven.And, a Navy has to be a ""well-balanced force"", so, it's not about nuclear submarine vis-a-vis aircraft carrier, as each of the two bring their own capabilities and they are ""not either/or"", Admiral Kumar said.On Atmanirbhar Bharat, he reiterated that the Indian Navy has ""committed to the national leadership that we (Navy) will be fully Atmanirbhar by 2047"".He added that as Indian economy is poised to grow in coming years, the volume of trade will multiply along with it, and hence the importance of role of Indian Navy will also grow.He explained that there are three components to a naval asset -- float, move and fight.In float component, about 95 per cent self-reliance has been achieved, while in move components which includes system propellers etc., it is about 65 per cent. And, in fight component, the figure is about 55 per cent, the Navy chief said.Among other challenges, Admiral Kumar, also spoke of the region being prone to natural disasters, as also ""non-combatant evacuations"" which have been happening rather frequently.Admiral Kumar underlined the challenge of cyber threat as well and ""weaponisaion of cognitive domain"" through largely use of social media."

Again, the monetary policy actions and stance of the Reserve Bank through 2022- 23 are validated,” the paper added.Elaborating on the strategy way forward, the paper says that in the absence of “unfavourable idiosyncratic” shocks, conditions are right for early signs of grudging disinflation to firm up into a central tendency. It says, inflation persistence and trend are on the decline, however gradual, suggesting that inflation expectations are slowly getting re-anchored as policy actions and stance are gaining traction and have started showing demand restraining influences.“For monetary policy, the recommendation would be: wait and watch, while guiding inflation towards the imminent onset of a low inflation regime,” it said.The paper says that since the second half of 2022-23, individual sub-groups are exhibiting higher volatility — sporadic supply shocks are at work — but, importantly, covariance is declining.This suggests that generalisation or broad-basing of inflationary pressures is on the ebb and increasingly localised price movements are influencing headline inflation, the paper adds.“This calls for fine-tuning measures to align demand and supply of specific goods and services, which lies outside the realm of monetary policy but are being undertaken on an ongoing basis to head off potential price pressures from getting deep-seated,” it says."

NEW DELHI: India’s economic activity stayed resilient in March though the weakening pace of exports and an increase in unemployment dimmed the outlook for the country that’s surpassing China as the most populous nation While the needle on a dial measuring the so-called Animal Spirits was unchanged at 5 for a third straight month, a jump in collections from taxes levied on consumption showed Asia’s third largest economy was ticking along.That’s the reading from the overall activity tracker comprising of eight high-frequency indicators compiled by Bloomberg.The readings come in the backdrop of the Reserve Bank of India pausing rates for the first time since May to evaluate the impact of 250 basis points in rate increases so far and to support growth. Retail and wholesale price-gains have eased on still-elevated rates, spurring calls for a longer pause.Last week, India’s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said her government was making “enough efforts” to ensure the economy stays buoyant though she expressed concern over the OPEC+ output cut and impact of decisions related to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Weakness in demand for manufacturing goods and services activity could be a drag on India’s recovery, she added.Here are more details from the animal spirits barometer, which uses a three-month weighted average to smooth out volatility in single-month readings:Purchasing managers’ surveys showed manufacturing activity improved as pressure on supply chains eased on increased raw materials availability. Activity in services sector moderated in March from a 12-year high in the previous month, bringing the composite index down to 58.4 from 59 in February.“A sizable proportion of services firms hiked their selling prices to hedge against rising costs,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.Exports dropped 13.9% in March, declining for a fourth straight month, while imports fell 7.90% from a year ago.“Headwinds from a slowing global economy are beginning to weigh more on exports,” said Rahul Bajoria, economist at Barclays Plc. Electronics exports gained traction, rising 57% in March from a year ago as major mobile equipment manufacturers are setting up production units in India with the China-plus-one strategy gaining ground, he said.Apple Inc now makes almost 7% of its iPhones in India and opened company-owned stores this week in the South Asian country to push retail sales.Liquidity in the banking system swung to a surplus in March, while credit growth moderated to 15%, from 15.52% in February, central bank data showed.Goods and services tax collections, which help measure consumption in the economy, rose 13% from a year earlier to 1.60 trillion rupees ($19.5 billion) in March — the second-highest level in the history of the six-year-old levy.New vehicle registrations slowed to 14% in the month from a 16% increase in February, according to data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations. Yet passenger vehicle sales growth improved to 14.42% year-on-year, from 10.9% rise a month ago.Electricity consumption, a widely used indicator to measure demand in the industrial and manufacturing sectors, has moderated. Peak demand in March fell to 170 gigawatt from 181 gigawatt a month ago and soaring temperatures across India could well increase power consumption in the months to come. The unemployment rate climbed to 7.80%, from 7.45% a month ago, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt, as companies tightened purse strings after the festive season."

India’s exports are expected to hit a record high of $770.2 billion in the financial year 2022-23. The record number comes at a time when the global economy is witnessing a slowdown. India has also set a target of $2 trillion exports by 2030. So, how strong is the India export story and how realistic is this dream of $2 trillion? We look to understand this in the video below.In this week’s episode of TOI Business Bytes, Madan Sabnavis , the Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda traces the journey of India’s exports and breaks down the growth in merchandise exports versus services exports .Interestingly, while exports will see a record number, merchandise exports have actually been contracting in the last few months.According to Sabnavis, India has an advantage when it comes to services exports, but the government should continue to focus on merchandise exports. “We need to qualify that when we are talking of exports of goods and services, we've seen a differential performance of goods from services. While services is something which has definitely been increasing at a very steady rate, it's not always been so for goods. And that is where I think there could be concerns going ahead,” he tells TOI.“For merchandise exports, we need to keep plugging to make sure that we're able to bring about higher rates of growth. Because at the end of the day, I think the overall Indian economy has to grow based on manufacturing,” he said. “If I'm going to concentrate a lot on manufacturing, which is where jobs are also being created, the SMEs are involved, I think we need to be looking in terms of our export growth being sustainable,” he notes.Sabnavis also explains whyelectronics exports have surpassed that of garments in the financial year 2022-23.

She also told global leaders during a meeting here that the current headwinds and strained global supply chains have put a tremendous pressure on the global economy, marked by persistently high interest rates, northbound inflationary pressures and currency depreciation.The recent turbulence in the banking sector in some advanced economies has further increased the challenges to global economic recovery and increased fiscal pressures, especially on EMDEs and LDCs, she said at the 107th meeting of the Development Committee on Wednesday during the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.Continued disruptions to global supply chains are still straining food, fuel and fertiliser supplies, and endangering food and energy security. This is disproportionately impacting the poor, the disadvantaged and the marginalised, particularly in the developing world, the minister observed.""The need of the hour is a people centric, equity driven, consensus-based, and collective approach to face global developmental challenges,"" the Union minister said.These circumstances challenge multilateralism more than ever before, she told the 'Development Committee' and added that against the backdrop of the WBG's 'Evolution Road Map' discussion, ""we encourage the World Bank Group (WBG) to evolve into a bigger and better bank, which is 'fit for purpose' to address the new world challenges"".In her address, she called upon all shareholders and stakeholders to adopt an innovative, bold and robust approach to transform the WBG into an institution capable of effectively addressing present and future challenges.""We look forward to a WBG that deploys innovative ways to mobilises resources, unleashes its full potential as a solutions and knowledge bank, and fully leverages its comparative advantage to build a better world."" Sitharaman said.Sitharaman told the 'Development Committee' that despite challenges and global headwinds, the IMF in its Global Economic Outlook forecasts above six per cent economic growth rate for India, making it the only major economy growing at that rate.""With a manageable current account deficit and a growth rate highest among the major economies in the financial year 2023, the Indian economy has shown resilience in navigating the turbulence of the (Covid) pandemic as well as geopolitical spill-over,"" she said.The minister asserted that an optimistic business environment, robust industrial output and rapid vaccination coverage against Covid have provided a strong momentum to the Indian economy, as evidenced by an estimated GDP growth of 9.1 per cent for the previous financial year.India has moved on beyond the pandemic, staging a full recovery in FY22-23, ahead of many countries, and positioned itself in an upward pre-pandemic growth path, she said.""The unparalleled (anti-Covid) vaccination drive has not only ensured quick economic recovery but also ensured economic prospects for this year and beyond. Successful implementation of agriculture and labour reforms have provided the boost for medium-term growth,"" the minister said.India's 'Long-Term Low-Carbon Development Strategy' envisages a transition to a low-carbon development pathway that entails costs towards deployment of new technologies, development of new infrastructure and other transaction costs, Sitharaman said.She added that the Union Budget has also pursued energy transition by encouraging domestic production of solar power equipment and batteries, in line with India's climate commitments, she said.Sitharaman said the WBG should continue to focus on its vision of a 'World Free of Poverty' as well as on the twin goals of 'Ending Extreme Poverty' and 'Promoting Shared Prosperity'.""This said, we underscore the need to ensure that the twin goals are achieved in a manner that is inclusive so as to reach all persons, resilient so as to safeguard them against developmental shocks and sustainable from the social, economic and environmental angles so as to ensure the wellbeing of future generations,"" she said.""While we concur that climate change, pandemic and fragility are global challenges, it is also important to focus on other global development challenges such as food insecurity, water and energy access and affordability, digitalisation and debt sustainability,"" the minister said.Sitharaman said given the limited scale of available resources, it is, therefore, crucial to reach a consensus on the definitions of global development challenges and ""develop selectivity criteria that is consistent with the WBG's mandate and its comparative advantage""."

Let's not forget this is one of the bright spots in the global economy right now.Such a high growth rate and it is moderating down to 5.9 with a -.2 revision compared to January, what's happening here is also a set of historical revisions,"" said Leigh. IMF on Tuesday lowered its growth projection for 2023-24 to 5.9 per cent from 6.1 per cent earlier but despite a significant drop, India continues to be the fastest-growing economy in the world, the World Economic Outlook figures revealed.""We realize that 2020-2021 has been actually a lot better than we thought and so actually there's less room for catching up. And that pent-up demand from consumers that were informing our previous forecast is therefore going to be less because they've already had more catching up before. So that's why there's a downward revision this year. Then we go up to 6.3 next year again, a very strong economy which is necessary to allow India to continue to converge towards higher living standards and create those jobs that are necessary,"" added Leigh.The IMF projects India's inflation to slow to 4.9 per cent in the current year and further to 4.4 per cent next fiscal year.IMF growth forecast is lower than the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) projection. The central bank predicted 7 per cent GDP growth for FY 2022-23 and 6.4 per cent in the ongoing fiscal that started on April 1.Meanwhile, the international lender flagged concerns about inflation, debt and risks to the financial sector from rising interest rates. It warned that if banks cut lending further, the global output will reduce by another 0.3 percentage point in 2023.""Despite the fillips from lower food and energy prices and improved supply-chain functioning, risks are firm to the downside with the increased uncertainty from the recent financial sector turmoil,"" the report said.The IMF projects growth to bottom out at 2.8 per cent in 2023, picking up to 3 per cent in 2024. Inflation is expected to stay elevated at 7 per cent for the rest of the year, before declining to 4.9 per cent next year.China's growth rate is projected to be 5.2 per cent in 2023 and 4.5 per cent in 2024 against its growth rate of three per cent in 2022.The US's growth forecast for 2023 is 1.6 per cent, France's 0.7 per cent, while Germany and the UK are a dismal -0.1 per cent and -0.7 per cent, respectively.Most countries will, however, avoid recession in 2023 despite the COVID pandemic lingering and tightening financing conditions as the Russia-Ukraine war continues."

The report titled ‘Economic Cost and Social Impact of Illiteracy’ covers multiple countries and has pegged the annual loss to global economy due to illiteracy at a whopping $1 trillion.Andrew Kay , co-author of the report and CEO of World Literacy Foundation, said, “Reduced income earning capacity and social costs are the main reason why illiteracy is costing the Indian economy each year.As a community of literacy experts, we face significant challenges as the early data shows a drop in literacy rates post-pandemic.”In the report, India’s data is compiled under the ‘emerging countries’ category, which also includes China. The WLS report states that China loses around $135 billion dollars annually due to illiteracy.The report also claims that 33.9% of people in India have low-level literacy skills, which they are unable to convert into real social and economic gains.“Functional illiteracy means a person may be able to read and write simple words, but cannot apply these skills to tasks such as reading a medicine label, balancing a chequebook, or filling out a job application. Behind the numbers are the millions of people who live in poverty due to the simple fact that they are illiterate,” states the report’s summary section.The report adds that “in India approximately 475 million people struggle to read, write, and hold basic numeracy skills”. WLS hosted literacy experts from over 80 countries. The report presented during the summit says its purpose “is to highlight the economic and social cost of illiteracy to the global economy”.The report’s authors say countries which are part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED), spend an average of 4.6% of their GDP on educational institutions at primary, secondary and tertiary levels.The authors sampled studies from all countries mentioned in the report based on UNESCO’s mathematical formula for calculating the economic impact of illiteracy. “This report assumes that illiteracy costs a developed nation 2% of its GDP, an emerging economy 1.2% of GDP, and a developing country 0.5% of GDP,” the authors said.The report says a multi-pronged approach is needed to solve the problem, which include adult literacy programmes, incentives for students to remain in school, training of teachers etc."

India has the second largest Muslim population in the world. The answer also lies in the fact that investors have been coming to India. I will say that please come and see for yourself the reality, rather than listening to those who haven't even seen what is happening on the ground,"" she said during the interaction, which focussed on ""resilience of the Indian economy amid tightening of Indian conditions"".She was responding to a question by Posen on violence against Muslims in India as reported by Western media and also opposition MPs losing their status (referring to Rahul Gandhi 's disqualification from Parliament).Meanwhile on the Indian economy's resilience, the finance minister said that ""it is due to the enterprising nature of Indians . Despite suffering and loss of lives, we took up Covid-19 as a challenge and helped each other. The government extended support to people through targeted approach and undertook humanitarian steps.""Speaking on supply chain disruptions, the finance minister said, ""Given the shocks witnessed due to supply chain disruptions, MNCs have become prudent and are diversifying. India is poised for a more important role in the global value chains. India is attractive because of its skilled youth and large domestic market.""Highlighting India's future goals, Sitharaman said, ""Today, we are reaching saturation in providing basic facilities to citizens such as houses, electricity, transport, etc., and are empowering them. Emphasis is there on financial inclusion so that all have bank accounts and benefits reach them directly. Going forward, we are focusing on skilling and digitisation so that there's greater ease of living, transparency and formalisation of the economy.""On emerging markets and G20, she noted that India is carrying forward agendas of earlier G20 Presidencies, bringing issues on table that India considers important and also making way for the future G20 Presidencies to build upon the legacy of India's G20 Presidency.""Emerging Markets have G20 Presidencies for three consecutive terms from Indonesia in 2022, India in 2023 and Brazil next year. This will bring views of the Emerging Markets to the front and also the voice of the Global South on to the G20 table,"" Sitharaman added.AAShe further said that the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are also holding a roundtable on Global Sovereign Debt.""Initial discussions happened at the first G20 FMCBG in Bengaluru. India's G20 presidency will create discussion and sharing of information on this issue and it will be taken forward positively,"" the finance minister added.On the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Sitharaman added that it should be more open about issues.""WTO has to be progressive and fair to all members. It has to give voice to all and not just hear but also heed. There's a continuation of a moratorium since 1998 on electronic transmissions despite evolution to the digital age.

If there is a perception, or if there's in reality, their lives are difficult or made difficult with the support of the state, which is what is implied in most of these write-ups, I would ask, will this happen in India in the sense, will the Muslim population be growing than what it was in 1947?"" said the Finance Minister.The condition of minorities is worsening in Pakistan and their numbers are declining by the day. Minorities in Pakistan are severely charged with minor allegations, leading to punishments like the death penalty. Blasphemy laws, in most cases, are used to fulfill a personal vendetta. Victims are immediately presumed guilty, even without proper investigation and holding the trial under a jury.""As opposed to, let us say, I take the name of the country and therefore the contrast can be sharper. As opposed to Pakistan, which was formed at the same time India was divided into two - Pakistan. Pakistan declared itself an Islamic country but however said minorities will be protected. Every minority has been dwindling in its number.....decimated in Pakistan. Even some of the Muslim sects have also been decimated,"" said Sitharaman.Comparing the Muslims of Pakistan with India, she said that Muslims in India are doing better.""Violence prevails against Muhajirs, Shia and every other group you can name which is not accepted by the mainstream. I don't know, Sunnis probably. Whereas in India you would find every strand of Muslims doing their business, their children getting educated. Fellowships are being given by the government,"" she added.Tearing into the alleged victimization of Muslims in India, she said, ""So across the board in India, if violence is happening to make Muslims get affected, itself is a fallacy as a statement. To say it's all the blame of the Government of India, I would want to say then, tell me, between 2014 and today, has the population dwindled? Have the deaths been disproportionately high in any one particular community? So, I would rather invite these people, who write these reports to come to India. I host them. Let them come to India and prove their point.""She further stated that emerging markets like India do carry the burden of ""you are the emerging market.""She said, ""You have every business to ask us for help, or every business to speak about, every issue on which you need to play a constructive role. But yet the prescriptions are ours. I would want to ask if human that's not to say or not to even imply that I accept the perception that you're referring to.""She said, ""It's the resilience of Indian people to take it upon themselves, to take the challenge and come out in their businesses despite tragedies at home, ""on the revival of the Indian economy post-pandemic.She further urged World Trade Organisation (WTO) to be more progressive.""I would love WTO to be more progressive, a lot more listening to all countries, and more fair.

The report presented during the summit says its purpose “is to highlight the economic and social cost of illiteracy to the global economy”.The report’s authors say countries which are part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED), spend an average of 4.6% of their GDP on educational institutions at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. The authors sampled studies from all countries mentioned in the report based on UNESCO’s mathematical formula for calculating the economic impact of illiteracy. “This report assumes that illiteracy costs a developed nation 2% of its GDP, an emerging economy 1.2% of GDP, and a developing country 0.5% of GDP,” the authors said.The report says a multi-pronged approach is needed to solve the problem, which include adult literacy programmes, incentives for students to remain in school, training of teachers etc."

India's growth to moderate to 6.4% in FY24: Asian Development Bank

Raghuram Rajan — the former International Monetary Fund chief economist who predicted the global financial crisis more than a decade ago — warned that the banking system is headed for more turmoil after the rescues of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse Rajan, who was also governor of Reserve Bank of India, said a decade of easy money and a flood of liquidity from central banks has caused an “addiction” and a fragility within the financial system as policy makers tighten policy.“I hope for the best but expect that there might be more to come, partly because some of what we saw was unexpected,” Rajan said in an interview in Glasgow. “The entire concern is that very easy money (and) high liquidity over a long period creates perverse incentives and perverse structures that become fragile when you reverse everything.”His comments add to warnings that the troubles at SVB and Credit Suisse are indicative of deeper underlying problems in the financial system.While IMF chief economist in 2005, Rajan gave a prescient warning on the banking sector ahead the global financial crisis in a Jackson Hole speech that prompted former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to call him a “luddite.” Rajan, now a professor at University of Chicago Booth School of Business, also won acclaim for his handling of the Indian economy while leading its central bank from 2013 to 2016.Bank shares slumped following the crises at SVB and Credit Suisse but central banks have pushed ahead with policy tightening to rein in inflation.Rajan said central bankers have been given a “free ride” as policy makers rapidly reverse the ultra-accommodative stance taken in the decade following the financial crisis.“This sense that the spillover effects of monetary policy are huge and aren’t dealt with by ordinary supervision has just escaped our consciousness over the last so many years,” Rajan said.He said banks are vulnerable to unwinding after central banks “flooded the system with liquidity.”“It’s an addiction that you’ve forced into the system because you flood the system with low return liquid assets and banks are saying, ‘we’ve got to hold this, but what do we do with it? Let’s find ways to make money off it’ and that gives makes them vulnerable to the withdrawal of liquidity.”"

Rajeswari Sengupta

Updated: Mar 20, 2023, 22:33 IST IST

US bank failures – Europe may see similar troubles – are thanks to monetary/fiscal imprudence. And India should brace for aftershocks

If 2022 was the year of “heightened global uncertainty”, this year is proving to be no different. Until last week, the US financial system seemed resilient to aggressive interest rate hikes. That perception has now been shattered. Cracks have started showing in the US banking system, triggering fears of a possible financial contagion. The macroeconomic repercussions will be felt far away in India, even if our banking system does not immediately face the same kind of problems. How might the US situation play out, and what does it imply for the Indian economy ?

The genesis of the SVB collapse can be traced to the decisions of the US Federal Reserve during the pandemic period. The Fed lowered interest rates close to zero and injected vast amounts of liquidity. Banks (like SVB) consequently received large volumes of deposits and invested them in treasury bonds, which made them dependent on these bonds for earning returns."

In an interview in Chennai on Friday, he told TOI that there is no need to revise India's 6.5% GDP growth projection in FY24.Excerpts from his interview:Was there any discussion today on the current banking turmoil?Most countries naturally feel that the situation that arose with the institutions in Europe and specific institutions had specific reasons and therefore the participants from those countries do not think that there is a need for a widespread concern.They feel that policy makers have things under control and they are responding. Of course, they said, there is a need to remain vigilant and strengthen risk management. Naturally, the current prevailing sentiment is that it need not lead to a systemic crisis.What were the key areas of deliberations on the first day of G20 framework working group in Chennai?Several countries feel that inflation is stickier and coming down more slowly than they would like to. Most countries reiterated that they would remain on track with their monetary tightening. They also feel that financial stability risks can be handled and that need not come in the way of further interest rate increases in their countries. IMF in its presentation at our request - India G20 presidency, included some important information on the availability of critical minerals and rare earths such as copper, cobalt and lithium will be needed if we have to switch to renewable energy.We know that production of these minerals is concentrated in a few countries and processing is also concentrated in few countries, predominantly China. But the demand is going to come from the entire world. There is lot riding on this.Ensuring their adequate availability for all the countries for the next 20-30 years and developing technologies to minimise the dependence on these minerals, recycling and making the technologies commercially viable and shared with all the countries are very important, if the world as a whole has to succeed in tackling climate change.What are the positives that were discussed?In the global economy, the positives, they feel commodity - food and prices have come down. The economic activity in several countries has picked up in the last few months. They feel that China's reopening has gone off relatively smoothly, which is both a positive and some concern that the reopening may also lead to higher demand for commodities down the road.How Indian banks are remaining strong and resilient in the context of some US regional banks collapsing and Federal Reserve hiking 25bps?The Indian central bank and the governor have said very clearly that our banks are safe, resilient and stable. Our good luck is that we went through the financial cycle last decade. We have invested a lot of time and effort in strengthening the bank balance sheets and looking at their risk parametres. In that sense, the memories are still fresh. We haven't forgotten the lessons of the last financial cycle. It also gives an additional layer of protection.Amid the Ukraine-Russia war, which is having an impact on the energy supply crisis and U.S. is probably headed for a recession, will India be able to sustain the projected GDP of 7% in the current fiscal? What would be the GDP projected for FY24?For FY24, the economic survey has made a projection of 6.5%. RBI came out with a projection of 6.4% and the IMF in January said it will be 6.1%.But we also said in the economic survey that the 6.5% is our baseline number. We said the range is from 6 to 6.8%, which means we were signaling that the downside risk to 6.5% is higher than the upside to 6.5%. We stand by that and do not see any reason to revise it at this point.How would the Indian economy to perform in FY24? Industries/Sectors that could be affected by impending global recession?Difficult to talk about the sectors to be hit because we have not changed our outlook of 6.5%. If there is a big financial crisis globally, similar to the one that happened in 2008, which we are not predicting at the moment at all to be very clear.If there is one, there will be naturally huge amounts of interbank financing flows, it could affect technology funding, startups and it will have a general impact on the economic growth as it had in 2008-09.

US Fed

's decision to hike key rate may impact

:

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, but indicated it was on the verge of pausing further increases in borrowing costs amid recent turmoil in financial markets spurred by the collapse of two US banks.The move set the US central bank’s benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.75%-5.00% range.In a key shift driven by the sudden failures this month of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, the Fed’s latest policy statement no longer says that “ongoing increases” in rates will likely be appropriate.When the US Federal Reserve raises its domestic interest rates, the difference between the interest rates of the two countries decreases, thus making India less attractive for the currency carry trade, consequently, some of the money may be expected to move out of the Indian markets and flow back to the US, therefore decreasing the value of India’s currency against the US dollar.The Reserve Bank of India is expected to hike key rates as the central bank will need to ensure that there is an interest rate differential between India and the US to attract dollars at a time when India is expected to witness a record current account deficitIf interest rates in the US increase, the spread between US and Indian government bonds will narrow causing global funds to pull money out of Indian G-secs. RBI will therefore have to raise interest rates in India to prevent FPI outflows from Indian bond market.Next, FPI may start moving money from Indian markets as investments become more attractive in the US.The BSE-benchmark Sensex on declined 290 points in a volatile session to settle below the 58,000 mark on Thursday due to a sell-off in banking, financial and IT stocks amid a mixed trend in global equities.""Although the Fed's decision to increase rates by 25 basis points was in line with expectations, concerns were raised by the US Treasury Secretary's statement that blanket insurance for all deposits was not being considered.""The domestic market attempted to recoup its initial losses with the help of favourable US futures as the Fed hinted at its plan to pause rate hikes sooner. However, the recovery was short-lived due to a sluggish start in the European market led by a 50 bps hike by the Swiss National Bank,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services."

Confidence in growth is likely to encourage the MPC to raise rates.Most analysts are holding back on their forecasts and waiting to see what action the US Federal Reserve takes on Wednesday.

Consumption slowdown is temporary because post-pandemic economic recovery across classes is still uneven. Spending will soon be powered by a rapidly growing middle class

Worries about India’s consumption growth slowing down are overdone. But it’s true that spending currently is very skewed across classes. Let’s look at various data sets to understand this. The first advance estimates of GDP for the current fiscal, 2022-23 (FY23) show private final consumption expenditure (PFCE), a proxy for household consumption, is expected to rise in absolute terms to Rs 164 trillion from Rs 143 trillion in FY22 and Rs 121 trillion in FY21. The 7.7% growth in PFCE in FY23 is on expected lines.

Market sentiment

NEW DELHI: India’s economy picked up speed in December as business conditions improved, marking a rebound for the South Asian nation that had showed signs of a slowdown the preceding month.The needle indicating so-called animal spirits moved right after holding steady for five straight months — indicating stronger overall economic activity as 2022 drew to a close.Consumer spending boosted tax collection and manufacturers signaled optimism about the future, while services sector saw expansion of new businesses.The reading comes ahead of the unveiling of India’s budget on Feb. 1, when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to highlight India’s potential to grow at a world-beating pace in the year beginning April. The performance of Asia’s third-largest economy contrasts with that of many developed nations, which face recessions this year.India still has some vulnerabilities on the path ahead. Exports contracted in two of the past three months, leaving several companies struggling to secure new work from key overseas markets. Prices of finished products rose as firms passed on higher input costs and business expenses. Among the eight indicators tracked by Bloomberg, India’s unemployment inched up and banks witnessed lower demand for credit.Bloomberg’s animal spirits barometer uses a three-month weighted average to smooth out volatility in single-month readings. Below are more details:A purchasing managers’ survey reflected robust activity in both manufacturing and services in December. The composite index climbed to an 11-year high. Output rose sharply. New orders in manufacturing also climbed the fastest since February 2021, while services firms saw new businesses increasing for the seventeenth straight month in December.“While some may question the resilience of the Indian manufacturing industry in 2023 amid a deteriorating outlook for the global economy, manufacturers were strongly confident in their ability to lift production,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.Exports fell 12.2% in December compared to a year ago, but at $34.5 billion were still at a three-month high in value terms, data released by the trade ministry showed. Exports remain competitive despite global headwinds, commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal said.Imports fell 3.46% from the previous year, narrowing the trade gap for the second month to $23.76 billion. Moderating commodity prices and a broader weakening of the dollar have helped lower India’s import bill, but a continued weakness in exports could hinder recovery from a record-high current account gap seen during the July-September quarter.Liquidity in the banking system tightened, and bank credit slowed to 14.9% in December, from 17.2% in November. The Reserve Bank of India’s 225 basis points increase dampened demand for housing, automobiles and consumer goods. Still, double-digit loan growth was a vast improvement over the single-digit expansion observed between September 2019 and March 2022.Goods and services tax collection, which helps measure consumption in the economy, rose 15%. Revenue collection has stood at more than 1.4 trillion rupees for 10 straight months. New vehicle registrations rose 8.2% in the month, according to data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations.Electricity consumption, a widely used proxy to measure demand in industrial and manufacturing sectors, rose from the previous month. Peak demand at the end of December rose to 171 gigawatt from 162 gigawatt a month ago. And India’s unemployment rate climbed to a 16-month high of 8.3% as job creation failed to keep pace with a growing workforce."

The real question, as talk of a financial turmoil gathers pace, is why US Fed, as well as RBI, used high interest rates to fight supply-side inflation. Risk for India is low, especially if RBI now doesn’t follow Fed

It is unlikely that the US Silicon Valley Bank crisis will have much effect on Indian startups, or Indian economy . Unless RBI follows a lazy policy of blindly following US Fed. That is what the history of inflation, policy and interest rates suggest.

Prior to Covid, world inflation had been low, and declining, for some 25 plus years. In 2019 median emerging market inflation rates had converged to just 1 percentage point above the median inflation in advanced economies. Real rates, across the world, were low and steady to declining. Hence the popular, nay universal refrain, that we were living in a “lower for longer” interest rates (and inflation) world."

issue. Do these shocks pose a risk to

economic recovery?

Is there a slowdown in demand?

NEW DELHI: CII president Sanjiv Bajaj, who is also the CMD Of Bajaj Finserv, believes that the SVB crisis will have a limited impact on India and suggests that the time has come for the RBI to chart its own interest rate trajectory, independent of what other central banks do. Excerpts:Quick action has been taken by the US government to stop any contagion effect by protecting all depositors, while also ensuring that taxpayer money is not used for it.That itself would provide confidence to the market. Near term, I believe action has been taken and now suitable buyers will come on board. It also brings about the question that over-dependence on any one entity is not good for the long-term and that kind of resilience needs to be built in any system so that we can avoid these kinds of shocks in the future. As far as India is concerned, our startup ecosystem, some of them have deposits that’s protected now. I don’t see any major impact.There is clearly the opportunity for doing that and already there are many lenders in the private space. Given the scale, startups will keep growing. It requires a discussion to say what is an enabling institutional mechanism that you create. For a very long time, we will need a significant amount of foreign capital. So, how do you provide a right viable long-term pathway for them to earn a reasonable return? In a growing country like India, we need to channelise our domestic savings also into productive longterm purposes because if it only goes into gold and real estate, it gets locked down. If that money goes into safe financial products for the long term, it has a multiplier effect on the economy and two of the biggest sectors are pension and insurance, which attract long-term money and which can make long term investment.The government has been very proactive in promoting the twin agenda of ease of doing business and encouraging foreign investment. We urge the government to reconsider amendment to introduce angel tax on consideration received from non-residents, in excess of face value of shares, as proposed in this year’s Budget. This will encourage continuity of foreign inflows to startups.The Indian economy is large and diversified enough not to be impacted by any local challenge that comes up. It is also true that nobody can envisage and act in advance of every possible challenge that will come up. But what the SVB action has shown from the government side or over here, with Adani Group, their own action has shown is that when a challenge comes, how quickly you address in dissipating the challenge.Very clearly the growth is uneven. . . Rural growth is slower than urban growth. . . Our inflation is coming under good control. . . You don’t need to follow a common coordinated action."
