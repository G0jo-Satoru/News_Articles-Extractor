India-Canada diplomatic row: Indian High Commission asks Canada to produce evidence in Nijjar’s killing

In reference to the pro-Khalistani activities in Canada, Jaishankar said that freedom of speech and freedom of expression ""comes with a certain responsibility and the misuse of those freedoms and the toleration of that misuse for political purposes would be very wrong"".
The external affairs minister also recalled the attacks on the High Commission of India in Canada, or smoke bomb attacks on the High Commission and Consulate General, and said Indian diplomats were ""intimidated in public, with no action from the Canadian authorities against culprits"".

Following the expulsion of the Indian official in September, the Indian government, in a tit-for-tat move, ordered a senior Canadian diplomat to leave the country within five days, saying the decision reflected growing concern over the interference by Canadian diplomats in India’s internal affairs and their anti-India activities.
India had earlier rejected Trudeau's allegations as ""absurd"" and ""motivated"".
India-Canada ties have remained frosty for several years over widespread Khalistan extremism in Canada but the diplomatic ties hit all-time low after Trudeau government alleged India of foreign interference and links of the Indian government in killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.
Jaishankar is currently on a 5-day visit to UK review various aspects of bilateral ties and give ""new impetus to the friendly ties"".

The g20 economies did not mention the conflict between Israel and Hamas in their communique, sparking questions about the forum's role. The communique expressed concern about natural disasters in Libya and Morocco but made no reference to the crisis in Gaza.

The text, agreed by G20 finance leaders gathered for an IMF-World Bank meeting in Marrakech, noted deep anguish at the loss of life and destruction in natural disasters in Libya and Morocco and said they stood in solidarity with the people there.

But there was no reference at all to the crisis in Gaza, where Israel's military has told more than 1 million people to relocate south as it amassed tanks for an expected ground invasion after a devastating attack by militant group Hamas.
A source briefed on the G20 discussions said differences over the Hamas attacks and Israel's response had prevented inclusion of any statement on the Israel-Gaza conflict in the communique, pitting Russia, China, India and Saudi Arabia against the United States and Western powers.

Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told a news conference in Marrakech that the Israel-Gaza events were left out of the G20 communique because they did not feature much in the financial officials' discussions.
One source familiar with the G20 deliberations said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had long been a divisive issue among G20 members, and said it was not surprising that they decided to skip any mention.

The latest escalation of the Middle East conflict began at the weekend just as G20 leaders started gathering in Marrakech.
Failure to mention the violence revealed deep divisions roiling the G20, said Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, a coalition of more than 750 religious groups and organisations.
""What's happening in Israel and Gaza is a horrific tragedy and if we can't stand up for the protection of children on both sides, it shows how stalemated they are,"" he said.
The G20 has been deeply divided since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Its membership includes the United States, European powers, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, other major economies of Asia, South America and most recently the African Union.
On the Ukraine war, the G20 text stuck close to language agreed at last month's meeting of the group's leaders in New Dehli urging countries to stick to UN rules on territorial integrity, highlighting the human suffering of the conflict and noting ""different views and assessments of the situation"".
Separately, a European official said the customary final communique to wrap up the week of IMF meetings ending Saturday would not be possible because Nordic European and Baltic countries considered the proposed wording on the Ukraine war - a carbon copy of the G20 language - was ""too watered down"".
Fears are growing that the latest Middle East strife could spread, with Iran warning of a response from its allies, which include Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The crisis hung over the IMF-World Bank meetings on the global economy, where World Trade Organization chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters officials were ""on eggshells"".
She said the Israel/Hamas conflict would have ""really big impact"" on already weak global trade flows if it widened throughout the region, joining a chorus of other financial officials who say they are carefully watching the conflict.
""The real problem is to be able to contain the (Middle East) crisis as much as possible so as not to create another element of infection on top of Ukraine's crisis,"" Italian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti told reporters.

Werner Hoyer, head of the European Investment Bank which has projects in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, said finance leaders in Marrakech had no choice but to grapple with the implications of the situation.
""(It would be) too artificial to sit here and do business as usual while the world is on fire,"" he said."

Referring to the decisions taken at the G20Summit in Delhi, the independent expert group in its second report said: ""The G20 was exceptional in its determination to be more inclusive, as demonstrated by the inclusion of the African Union.
The MDBs must reflect this same sense of inclusion and collaboration by working better together and building on country-owned programmes. We call this making MDBs better, bolder and bigger... Given the urgency of what is needed, the road map of recommendations starts now, but has an eye towards having an MDB system that is fit for purpose by 2030.""
During India's G20 presidency, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had set up the group, co-chaired by Larry Summers, at the first meeting of FMs and central bank governors in Bangalore to ensure that more resources are available to developing countries in their fight against climate change and other global public goods.
While calling for tripling of annual lending commitments to $390 billion from $120 billion, several reforms have been suggested, including ""whole-of-MDB strategies"" to scale up private finance, through agencies such as the International Finance Corporation. Currently, MDBs manage to tap the private sector for funding of $60 billion for $100 billion of lending and the idea is to double the private sector contribution.

However, at present, most of the security staff earlier seen on the roads is absent, leaving the public property vulnerable to theft and damage. With no proper maintenance, many of the plants have also dried up.

According to an official in PWD's horticulture wing, the department has taken almost half of the pots placed for G20 back to four nurseries to avoid theft. To take care of the remaining plants, private contractors will be hired.

""We are watering the pots placed along the roads with the help of tankers. But that is not sufficient sometimes. About half the pots that were smaller in size - with a diameter less than 18cm - have been sent back to the nurseries.

This head scratch-worthy nugget makes no sense because it is code that security agencies used as call signs for dignitaries, hotels, visit sites and even carcade managers.
“Tarzan” was the call sign for the cavalcade managers.

The “rainbow” was the foreign dignitary. ITC Maurya Sheraton, where US President Joe Biden stayed, was called “Pandora”. Had the codes leaked, it would have been more than a box of terible things for the police, Special Protection Group (SPG) and National Security Guard (NSG).
Like “Pandora”, Shangri La, which hosted British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, was called “Samara”. The Taj Mansingh was labelled “Paramount”, Le Meridien “Mahabodhi” and Rajghat “Rudrapur”.

These code names, assigned by the Delhi Police that was managing the security, were changed at intervals to keep high-security movements confidential.
The police seem to have left no stone unturned during security drills. Their expertise in carcade management was honed through meticulous rehearsals. Cavalca de movement timings were followed strictly. For example, the movement of two motorcades had to have a gap of about three minutes. While some carcades would need to finish moving from point Ato B in 18 minutes, others would take 15 minutes. The carcade drivers were trained by the best and the core group comprised sleuths of the SPG and the NSG.

Another security challenge was that some leaders always travel in their own cars that accompany them around the world. The “Beast”, a custom-fitted Cadillac, accompanies the US President everywhere. Also, there are three such cars, not one. The US delegation, in addition to the Cadillacs, had 47 high-end cars that were flown to India on a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III aircraft.
Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan got their own fleets to Delhi.
The management of the call signs was a collaborative effort of Delhi Police's security unit, the SPG and the NSG. The call signs would have guarded against any leak in the event of a wireless communications breach.
Throughout the summit, the confidentiality of the code words was of “Paramount” importance. Even junior-level police officers were unaware of them. It was one of the ways that kept Pandora’s box sealed."

“I am with the traditional shack operators, but they cannot take the government for granted and issue different statements every time.

These cops, who are of the rank of constables and head constables, will be deployed in shifts and will be on duty round the clock. A woman officer of DCP rank will be their supervisory official, added the source.
During a meeting of the police brass last month, attendees were told that focused attention should be paid to video analytics of feeds from critical areas, said the source.

""There should be seamless communication between police officers who are deployed for CCTV monitoring and those who are in the field. Adequate and trained manpower should be deployed for this,"" cops were told during the meeting.
According to sources, the women staff have been trained by experts in monitoring CCTV cameras.
""During the training, they were briefed about the identification of critical areas and whom to alert in case they find something suspicious,"" said another officer.
The officer said they have identified over 100 critical areas at the venue where they will be keeping a close watch. ""Critical areas include places where there is any kind of movement, including entry/exit and access points,"" he added.
Apart from CCTV monitoring, the personnel have been given training on wireless set handling, sending and receiving messages, frequency settings, intercom functions and operations.
The team of women officers will have direct access to security personnel deployed at various points. ""If they find something suspicious, they will inform the security staff deployed there immediately,"" the officer said.
Ahead of the G20 Summit, security agencies conducted an audit of the venue and found there was a need for CCTV installation.

A senior Delhi government official said that 18 food safety officers had been deployed to collect samples of raw food items being used at 19 five-star hotels in New Delhi and Aerocity areas where the delegates of the G20 summit would stay.
The exercise, said officials, started on September 4 and will continue till next Monday.
Though lifting food samples from the city's hotels is a routine exercise, officials confirmed that it has been intensified with the deployment of additional inspectors in view of the summit. The food safety officers will also keep watch on the food served at banquets and other events of the summit. Normally, reports of food samples take 15-20 days, but those of the food samples to be served to G20 guests will be available within a few hours.

""The samples collected from the hotels are being sent to a laboratory for checking. The raw food materials will be used for cooking after proper lab test reports are available within 2-4 hours.

During a spot visit to Purana Quila nursery, staff could be seen painting the logos on thermocol sheets. Gardeners will later place flowers on these using pins. Naresh Kumar, a gardener, said he had been doing similar work for the past 15 years. ""I got training from my superiors from time to time to brush up on my skills. This is a challenging task as flowers are biodegradable and start withering easily. We have to complete the work in a time-bound manner. The flowers are handled very carefully,"" he said. Another gardener, Jawan Singh, said making words out of flowers is more difficult than making logos.

As language barrier came in the way of purchase of a hand-woven fabric by the visiting dignitary, the G20 App came in handy for a helpless Rani.

Rani got to share her experience with PM Narendra Modi when he visited Bharat Mandapam on Friday to interact with around 3,000 people, including cleaners, drivers, waiters and other staff from across various ministries and departments, who also contributed in good measure on the ground to make the Summit a grand success.
""We took Madam (Emine) to Dilli Haat. She wanted to know about a certain fabric. I don't know Turkish language and Madam couldn't speak in Hindi. We used the translation facility on the G20 App and explained to the shopkeeper what madam wanted,"" she explained to the PM.

A convergence on Ukraine had evaded the countries in the meetings at the level of ministers and among the sherpas with Russia stonewalling the West's insistence to condemnMoscow's aggression. Demands from one side had been met with countervailing pressures from the other. For instance, when the West insisted on a condemnation of Russia for threatening to use nuclear weapons as part of the communique, Moscow came up with the retaliatory push for a mention of the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima.

It was then that Indian sherpa Amitabh Kant decided to start from a clean slate, and craft a new language which, while addressing the 15 principles, would accommodate the competing postures. He was already being assisted by his counterparts from Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia and his hand got stronger because of late assistance from four other emerging markets - Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, Mexico and Argentina.
A breakthrough was still not in sight as the sherpas kept pointing to their respective ""red lines"" and the absence of ""mandate"" from their leaders to redraw them.

On Friday evening, as leaders trickled into the capital, the negotiations, which had moved to Sushma Swaraj Bhawan in the Capital's diplomatic enclave, acquired both a sense of urgency and momentum.
The result was a draft, adopted on Saturday as a communique, which sought to ""accommodate all without offending anyone"". Russia was satisfied as it had not been named. This fell short of the hardline position favoured by many in the western bloc, but was still acceptable because of reference to the UN principles forbidding ""threat or use of force to seek territorial acquisition against the territorial integrity and sovereignty and political independence of any state"" - a formulation which fits Russia's conduct in Ukraine.
The criticism of the use of nuclear weapons can also be seen to be targeted at Russia. Moscow could live with it so long as it was spared specific mention.
It was then that Kant decided to close the wriggle space by saying that this was the final deal on the table. He invoked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to declare, according to sources, ""The leader has seen it and we cannot go beyond this."" Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia too took the same view and it was suggested that any change in the text should be done after consultations by the leaders.
Kant was helped by the fear among the western nations of the failure of a powerful grouping at a time of geopolitical churn when China is trying to create parallel centres of power.
The US was also keen to ensure that New Delhi, a strategic ally, should secure a successful outcome under its presidency. But China wasn't yet ready, and raised an ""important bilateral issue"" with the US, which was rejected, prompting China to go with the emerging nations' bloc.
ADVERTISEMENT

""At the end, it was the credibility and the stature of PM Modi that helped clinch the deal,"" Kant had said after the declaration was adopted on Saturday.
His discussions with leaders at the Brics Summit in Johannesburg as well as the Asean Summit in Jakarta and the solid support of the emerging countries worked in India's favour, which started with a focus to ensure that there was consensus on a strong communique so that G20 remained relevant.

He proudly stated that India is now on par with nations like the US, who embarked on their space journeys decades ago. The minister attributed India's quantum leap in space exploration to the supportive ecosystem created by the Modi government.

Furthermore, Singh highlighted the increased participation of public-private partnerships in the space sector, leading to a rise in startups. The central government has taken initiatives to establish space technology teaching centers in higher education institutions, exemplified by the ISRO Teaching Centre at the Central University of Jammu and NIT-Agartala.
Singh also touched upon the key features of the new National Education Policy, which empowers Indian youth to choose or change subjects based on their aptitude, skill, and interest, liberating them from the confines of their aspirations."

Contents of Chinese suitcases a mystery
The security personnel were anyway intrigued on getting to know that the Chinese delegation has sought a separate and 'private' internet connection, which the hotel declined. Sources at the hotel said the 12-hour-long drama was resolved only after Chinese security agreed to remove the equipment from the hotel and have it sent to their embassy.
Incidentally, the Brazilian president, the next host of the G20 summit, was also staying in the same hotel.


Sources, who were part of the security at Taj Palace, confirmed that Chinese security personnel resisted the request to get the equipment checked but the Indian security team stood its ground.
“A three-member security team had to stand guard outside the room for around 12 hours before a Chinese security official reverted, saying they would have it sent to the embassy,” a source said.
Regarding the equipment, top officials said it couldn’t be said with certainty if these were 'surveillance set-up' as they didn’t get a chance to examine the devices.

An intelligence official’s assessment conveyed to his seniors said such equipment was generally used to intercept as well as jam secure communication channels. However, the content of the suitcases remains a mystery.
Chinese President Xi Jinping skipped the G20 summit and sent Premier Li Qiang instead. Li, whose arrival was announced at the last minute, did not travel on one of the usual ‘special aircraft’ meant for senior leaders and arrived on a chartered flight to the Indian agencies' surprise."

According to experts, it is important to be prepared for nuclear emergencies. If a person is exposed to dirty bombs (a mix of explosives, such as dynamite, with radioactive powder or pellets), he or she becomes a source of radiological emission and can spread the radiation to others. Therefore, the person needs decontamination and isolation from others.
Prof Kamran Farooque, head, AIIMS trauma centre, said, ""We are fully prepared for any eventuality for CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear) attack."" He added that 30-50 such patients can be accommodated at the centre.

He added that 25-30 Army personnel will look after decontamination, if the need arises. They will be deployed till the completion of the event.
According to doctors, in case of exposure to radiation, the person will have to go through a decontamination zone where he or she will be sanitised by a shower from a special solution. The effluent will be collected in a radio-protective metal tank, which can be disposed of only in radiation-safe tanks or protective rooms to prevent contamination to others.

""Doctors and healthcare workers who treat such victims will wear a special kit before touching the patients,"" said a senior doctor.
Meanwhile, RML hospital has been designated as the centre for tackling biological emergency cases. The authorities have installed a decontamination unit and kept 10 separate ICU beds for the purpose.

Everybody expected stern instructions and warnings against errors.
Instead, the police chief, himself sounding calm and composed, asked the cops not to give in to pressure and to be cool-headed while making decisions.
He said that whatever preparations were required were done and it was time to put the training to use.

In the event, the police personnel successfully pulled off what was termed a ""security nightmare"" without major glitches.

How did this happen? A special commissioner rank officer, one of those at the helm of affairs, explained, ""The key was planning. We started off late last year itself with officials of the home and external affairs ministry briefing us. Once the police brass learnt what was required for an event of this scale, a blueprint was drawn up.""
Three key areas were identified at the outset: carcade management, hotel security and venue management. ""Managing the motorcade of one country's head is itself a tough task, handling those of around 20 countries seemed a nightmare,"" said another officer. ""We began with extensive training alongside the central armed police forces in Noida and elsewhere.""

So effective was this training that from numerous blunders in the first motorcade rehearsal, errors were brought down to single digit in the week prior to the summit and ultimately to zero during the full rehearsal.
For securing the hotels, the police brass divided the establishments in two zones with two special commissioners as their heads. A DCP-rank officer was designated as the venue commander for each hotel. Eventually, the security was so intensive that the venue commanders and the special CPs were aware of every nook and corner of each hotel.
""The venue commanders and his team knew every staffer, including chefs, managers and room boys, by face by the time the summit began,"" revealed another special CP. ""They were even aware of which employee was positioned on which floor. A zero-area identification drive ensured there were no spots where communication signals were absent.""
On the instructions of Union home minister Amit Shah, the police brass had defined roles for each personnel. ""The police chief was very particular about having the right man for the right job. The home ministry even brought in a few special CPs and several DCP-rank officers to Delhi for about a month,"" disclosed an officer. Similarly, a joint commissioner-rank officer was put in charge of Bharat Mandapam, while another official of the same rank was made the chief of the CCTV and command room monitoring.
The Special Cell had a massive challenge of liaising with not only the Indian security establishment, but also foreign agencies. ""Nothing was done as a formality. The snipers deployed trained in things like shooting in night scenarios at Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh. Markswomen were placed on hotel rooftops only after training,"" said an officer. The cops, used to giving updates on WhatsApp, also resorted to secure wireless-set communication.
At a gathering on Monday, commissioner Arora said, ""The success of the event has driven home one conclusion: everything became possible due to the shared sense of pride and ownership. I struggle to find the right words to express my appreciation to all of you for your competence, sincerity, capability and meticulous execution, which made the G20 arrangements look easy when it was actually complex and multidimensional.""
The team spirit was in evidence when even an ACP-level officer, in charge of deployment at G20, received accolades from the brass during the gathering."

The independent expert group on strengthening multilateral development banks (MDBs) has called for quicker decision making, less risk aversion, and increased private capital. The World Bank is already taking action on these recommendations. The panel, established by India, estimates an annual requirement of $1 trillion to address climate change and other challenges, with half coming from lending and the rest from the private sector.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/panel-for-bigger-better-bolder-mdbs-says-singh/articleshow/104355606.cms,"TNN / Oct 12, 2023, 07:08 (IST)","MARRAKECH: The independent expert group on strengthening multilateral development banks (MDBs) has made a case for quicker decision making by these entities, less risk aversion and getting more private capital, said N K Singh, the co-chair of the panel.
The second volume of the report ""Bigger, Bolder, Better"" is due to be presented to G20 leaders on Thursday but Singh said that several MDBs had started initiating action on the recommendations with the World Bankseeking approval from its board of governors on Thursday.
He, however, said that the World Bank and other agencies needed to fix targets on private capital, just like steps taken in other areas.
The panel, set up by India under its G20 presidency, had estimated an annual requirement of $1 trillion for countries to meet the needs of combating climate change and other challenges, of which half was to come via concessional and non-concessional lending with the rest from the private sector. Another $2 trillion will have to come from domestic sources.
The expert group had also recommended the setting up of a Global Challenges Fund to tap into money that is available in the system and can be used to address the requirements of countries seeking funding.

At a meeting of the Emerging Markets Forum here, Singh said that the idea was to get MDBs to nearly treble their annual lending from around $120 billion to close to $400 billion and make them bigger. ""The challenge is how do you harness risk factors to get more private capital,"" he said.
He said quicker response to proposals, by reducing the average time (24-26 months) to process proposals and disburse loans to around 12 months will help them make better, along with steps to ensure that the MDBs work together to meet the requirements of countries.

Singh said that the independent expert group has suggested several steps to make MDBs bolder, including the use of innovative financing tools."
